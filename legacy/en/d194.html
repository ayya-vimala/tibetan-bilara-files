<p>The Inquiry of Jayamati</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisatvas!</p>
<p>Thus I have heard at one time. The Bhagavān was residing at the grove of Anāthapiṇḍada in Jeta Wood in Śrāvastī together with a great assembly of monks and a great multitude of bodhisatvas. Then, the Bhagavān addressed the bodhisatva Jayamati as follows.</p>
<p>“Jayamati, a faithful man or woman of a good family (1) who desires merit should worship the Tathāgata; (2) who desires discernment should be devoted to learning; (3) who desires heavenly rebirth should uphold moral conduct; (4) who desires wealth should increase charity; (5) who desires beauty should cultivate patience; (6) who desires eloquence should pay respect to the guru; (7) who desires memory should not have excessive pride; (8) who desires knowledge should frequently practice appropriate mindfulness;  (9) who desires liberation should abstain from all evil; (10) who desires to make all beings happy should generate the mind for awakening; (11) who desires a sweet voice should speak truthfully; (12) who desires virtuous qualities should take joy in solitude; (13) who desires the Dharma should attend to the spiritual friend; (14) who desires quiescence should frequently practice no contact with others; (15) who desires insight should frequently examine things as empty; (16) who desires rebirth in the world of Brahmā should cultivate love, compassion, joy, and equanimity; (17) who desires the abundant resources of gods and humans should behave in conformity with the path of ten virtuous actions; (18) who desires complete nirvāṇa should take joy in empty dharmas; (19) who desires to obtain all virtuous qualities should worship the Three Jewels.”</p>
<p>When the Bhagavān had spoken, the bodhisatva mahāsatva Jayamati, the complete assembly, and the world with its gods, humans, demigods and gandharvas rejoiced and highly praised what had been proclaimed by the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>This completes the noble Mahāyāna sūtra, “The Inquiry of Jayamati.”</p>
