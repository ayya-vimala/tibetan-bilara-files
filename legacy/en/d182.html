<p>The Perfection of Generosity</p>
<p>[How Bodhisattvas Exert Themselves in the Ten Virtuous Actions]</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One, in order to benefit his kinsmen and the local people, was residing in the parks of King Śuddhodhana in the city of Kapilavastu, parks adorned with many hundreds of thousands of trees of different types, such as sāla, palmyra, tamāla, karṇikāra, juniper, walnut, kharjūra, śipan, nīpa, mango, pear, āmalakī, wood apple, pomegranate, elephant apple, plantain, banyan fig, goolar fig, myrobalan, aśvattha, vārśika, nutmeg, dhanuṣkarī, rosewood, magnolia, aśoka, taraṇi, pāṭalā, śiriṣa, and arjun trees. The parks were beautified by cascading streams, waterfalls, lakes, pools, ponds, and springs of fragrant water filled with purple, pink, red, and white lotus flowers. There one could hear the calls of geese, peacocks, cranes, ducks, cuckoos, ospreys, parrots, grouse, pheasants, partridges, nightingales, and wild ducks. Countless honeybees buzzed in the air. The water in the parks possessed eight special qualities and was limpid, flavorful, cool, pristine, and pure. The grass was green, soft and tender, and as pleasing to the touch as silk, wool, cotton, raw silk, kācilindika cloth, and linen. Those fine parks were beautiful, clean, and free of any stones, pebbles, gravel, dirt, mud, or refuse. They were also home to various wild animals, such as śarabha, spotted deer, monkeys, cats, brown bears, rabbits, black bears,  hyenas, and a number of different birds. Hundreds of thousands of other beings were also present, such as gods and goddesses of the night, guardians of the world, Varuṇa, Śiva, Yama, Virūḍhaka, Kubera, Śakra, Virūpākṣa, and Dhṛtarāṣṭra, as well as asuras, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, and mahoragas.</p>
<p>A large saṅgha of seventy-seven thousand monks was also residing there, including venerable Śāradvatīputra, venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, venerable Subhūti, venerable Kapphiṇa, venerable Gavāṃpati, venerable Mahākauṣṭhila, venerable Bharadvāja, venerable Ājñātakauṇḍinya, venerable Bhadrika, venerable Pūrṇa, venerable Suśubha, venerable Cūḍāpanthaka, venerable Bakkula, venerable Rāhula, venerable Upananda, venerable Nanda, and venerable Ānanda. With the exception of one person—namely, venerable Ānanda—they were all worthy ones who had exhausted the defilements and were without afflictions. They were endowed with powers, and had liberated minds and liberated insight. They were of noble origin and like great elephants. Their work was done, their deeds were done, they had laid down their burden, they had accomplished their own welfare, and their ties to existence were exhausted. Due to their correct perception, their minds were utterly liberated, and they had perfected the sacred mastery of all mental states.</p>
<p>Also present was a great assembly of trillions of bodhisattvas that included the bodhisattva great beings Maitreya; Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta; Avalokiteśvara; Mahāsthāmaprāpta; Samantabhadra; Ākāśagarbha; Devamukuṭa; Ratnamukuṭa; Ratnapāṇi; Ratnaprabha;  Ratnagarbha; Ratnacūḍa; Ratnasiṃha; Ratnajālin; Jālinīprabha; Sūryaprabha; Candraprabha; Stable Strength; Dṛḍhamati; Dṛḍhavīrya; Dṛḍhavikrama; Determined Effort; Mahotsāha; Prāmodyarāja; Bhaiṣajyarāja; Bhaiṣajyasamudgata; King Precious Moonlight of Pure Virtue; Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitā­bhijña; Hair in a Topknot Shining Dark Like Bees, Ink, Peacocks, and Nightingales; Smiling Face That Brightly Shines Like the Moon and a Lotus Flower; Top Ornament of Precious Qualities With Magnificent Sapphire-Like Eyes; Equal and Evenly Set Teeth White Like Silver, Conch Shells, the Moon, a White Lotus, and Milk; Tongue Wide as the Leaves of Palm and Plantain Trees and Resembling a Copper Plate; Voice as Delightful as the Songs of Cuckoos, Parrots, Grouse, Pheasants, and Kalaviṅka Birds; Moonlike Body; Rising Sun; Resembling the Karṇikāra Tree, the Mango Tree, and the Blooming Burflower Tree; and the bodhisattva great being Slender, Supple, Firm, Fine, and Smooth Limbs Youthful Like Flowers and with Copper-Colored Nails.</p>
<p>Including these bodhisattvas, there were a total of ninety-nine thousand bodhisattvas, all of whom were irreversible in their progress and turned the wheel of the irreversible Dharma. They had subjugated demons and opponents and overcome all the activities of Māra. They were experts in the knowledge that engages with the domain of the thus-gone ones. They had developed the superknowledges, attained the retention that brings about the final gateway of the absorption of bravery, and mastered the skillful means related to all the perfections.  They revealed different world systems, had donned the great armor, and had no doubts concerning the qualities of the buddhas. By contemplating all the latent tendencies of the primary and secondary afflictions, they had conquered pride and its attendant habitual tendencies and predispositions. As such, they were disciplined and gentle. They had perfected the applications of mindfulness, the true exertions, the bases of miraculous power, the powers, the strengths, the factors of awakening, and other qualities of the path such as love, compassion, joy, equanimity, patience, and intention, as well as other wholesome propensities. They were free of pride, vanity, haughtiness, aggression, arrogance, miserliness, selfishness, possessiveness, fixation, attachment, grasping, oblivion, craving, and longing. For countless eons they had endeavored to benefit and bring happiness to both themselves and others, and they had thoroughly gathered the roots of virtue and perfected the accumulations. They were free of hypocrisy, deceit, lies, slander, harsh words, killing, harming, bondage, wrong views, threatening, quarreling, strife, fighting, dispute, dueling, and all related afflictions.</p>
<p>Also in attendance were the four guardians of the world: the great king Vaiśravaṇa, the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the great king Virūḍhaka, and the great king Virūpākṣa, each surrounded by his respective attendants. There were the yakṣa general Pāñcika accompanied by his sons, the yakṣa general Vajrapāṇi with his retinue of yakṣas, and the great bhūta Hārītī with her retinue of female yakṣas. Śaṅkhinī, Female Spear Holder, Yellow-Robed,  Umā, Mahāśrīdevī, Sarasvatī, Bhairavī, Candra, Śakra, lord of the gods, the god Maheśvara, and Brahmā, lord of the Sahā world, were also in attendance. All were accompanied by their respective divine retinues. There were also the nāga kings Anavatapta and Sāgara, each with his retinue of nāgas; the garuḍa rulers Mahātejas and Mahākāya, each with his retinue of garuḍas; the asura rulers Bali and Rāhu, each with his retinue; the kinnara king Druma with his retinue of kinnaras; and the gandharva Pañcaśikha with his own retinue. Countless other majestic gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans were also present.</p>
<p>In this way the Blessed One was surrounded by members of the four castes of priests, warriors, merchants, and commoners; the four retinues of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; as well as countless members of the Śakya clan, kings, ministers, townspeople, villagers, householders, officials, members of the royal court, and village elders. These people all attended to the Blessed One and served, honored, and venerated him. They made offerings such that the Blessed One obtained food, beverages, bedding, cushions, and medicine, as well as many other excellent offering articles. In this way the Blessed One’s fame, renown, and praise extended far throughout the immeasurable worlds of the ten directions.</p>
<p>The ground, of the essence of diamond, was even,  pleasant, vast, and open. It had been sprinkled with water, swept clean, made symmetrical, and made fragrant with smoke rising from incense burners. The ground was strewn with purple, pink, red, and white lotus flowers, as well as the flowers of goolar fig, nīpa, vārśika, taraṇi, pāṭalā, aśoka, kuraṇṭaka, nutmeg, and utika trees. The site was also adorned with trees made of various precious gems. There the Blessed One sat, on a lion throne made of precious gemstones, upon which hundreds of thousands of precious fabrics had been spread. The throne was sheltered by a precious bejeweled canopy, adorned with a precious web of small jewel bells, and embellished with precious gemstone lattices. It was further decorated with myriad precious materials and gemstones, such as gold, diamonds, beryls, pearls, conch shells, moonstones, coral, sapphires, emeralds, cat’s eye, and crystal.</p>
<p>The Blessed One’s senses were peaceful, his mind was at ease, and he had arrived at a sacred state of composure and tranquility. He had attained, sustained, and mastered perfect composure and calm, and he had brought his passions under control. Like a lake, his mind was pure, clear, and pristine. Like a sacrificial post made of precious substances, he was refined, dazzling, and brilliant. His body was adorned with the thirty-two major marks of a great being and beautified with the excellent minor marks. Like the ocean, he was filled with the water of the sacred Dharma. Like Mount Sumeru, he was unshakable. Like the earth, he sustained all beings. Like water, he gave rise to roots of virtue. Like the administration of justice, he was unbiased. Like the sky, he was immaculate. Like the sun, he dispelled the darkness of ignorance. Like the moon, he had perfected all pure qualities. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, he fulfilled all aspirations. Like the sun, he was lofty. Like the moon, he was cooling and soothing. Like the ocean,  he was a source of wealth, and like the ocean, too, he was deep. Like a fire, he was shining. His body was unshakable; his mind was unwavering, calm, and serene; and his senses were free of delusion, arrogance, and excitement. He observed perfect mindfulness, his conduct was excellent, and he was composed and constantly in equipoise. Over countless billions of eons he had accomplished all the roots of virtue and gathered the entire accumulation of merit; he had become skilled in all the perfections and he sported on all the levels of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. He enthusiastically engaged in all the activities of the bodhisattvas, strived for the benefit and happiness of all beings, and taught the Dharma.</p>
<p>The Dharma he taught presents pure conduct. It is virtuous in the beginning, virtuous in the middle, and virtuous in the end. This Dharma, with its excellent meanings and excellent words, is unadulterated, complete, pure, refined, stainless, luminous, pleasant, agreeable, fulfilling, elating, inspiring, delightful, and mentally enriching. It is pristine, fearless, gentle, stable, profound, immutable, unchanging, indisputable, beyond the reach of the intellect, inconceivable, marvelous, and utterly inexpressible. Such is the Dharma that he taught, presented, explained, and elucidated.</p>
<p>Present in the assembly at that time was the bodhisattva great being called Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows. He had a beautiful physique and was handsome and pleasant to behold. His complexion was attractive. He was well developed and replete with the most delightful features. He had served victorious ones of the past,  created roots of virtue with them, and honored myriad buddhas, and now he upheld the lineage of the Three Jewels. He was compassionate, and his eloquence was unimpeded. He was loving toward all beings, of pure faith, and his attitude was virtuous, steadfast, and profound. He was affectionate, filled with compassion, noble-minded, amicable, learned, wise, clear, intelligent, knowledgeable, devoid of laziness, disciplined, wholesome, honest, straight, soft, gentle, and sincere. As he was free of pride, vanity, haughtiness, strife, hostility, envy, miserliness, selfishness, possessiveness, attachment, suffering, unhappiness, and ignorance, he was endowed with merit.</p>
<p>At one point, the bodhisattva great being Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee on the calyx of a lotus flower. With his palms joined together he bowed down toward the Blessed One and said, “If the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity, I have a few questions I would like to put to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows, “Noble son, all the buddhas and bodhisattvas will always grant you this opportunity. Noble son, ask whatever you wish to the thus-gone, worthy, and perfect Buddha. I will answer your questions and bring satisfaction to your mind.”</p>
<p>At these words from the Blessed One, the bodhisattva great being Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows asked, “Blessed One, after having first given rise to the mind set on awakening, in what should noble sons and daughters exert themselves?”</p>

<p>As this teaching on the path of the ten virtuous actions was spoken, countless beings gave rise to the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening.</p>
<p>This was the first chapter of the Great Vehicle sūtra called “The Array That Ornaments, Adorns, and Decorates All Buddha Qualities.”</p>
<p>[How Bodhisattvas Exert Themselves in the Ten Perfections]</p>
<p>“Furthermore, noble son,  after having first given rise to the mind set on awakening, bodhisattva great beings should exert themselves in the ten perfections. What are those ten?

<p>At this point, the Blessed One uttered these verses:</p>
<p>“Through the generosity practiced by offering food,</p>
<p>The wise ones extend a fivefold gift:</p>

<p>Happiness, and eloquence.</p>

<p>By providing the beverage with the taste of liberation.</p>
<p>“The wise ones who offer beverages</p>

<p>A support, and a refuge for all beings!</p>
<p>“Noble son, this is how bodhisattva great beings exert themselves in the perfection of generosity.”</p>
<p>When the bodhisattva great being Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows heard the Blessed One’s detailed exposition on the perfection of generosity, he felt satisfied, delighted, and elated. Thrilled, happy, and ecstatic, he stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt with his right knee on the calyx of a lotus flower. With his palms joined together, he bowed down toward the Blessed One and applauded him by chanting these verses:</p>
<p>“Benefactor, this is excellent! You who are always like a father, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Benefactor, this is excellent! Well-Gone One, your words are excellent!</p>
<p>Friend, this is excellent! Beloved teacher, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Sole protector of hell beings, this is excellent!</p>
<p>“Excellent leader, this is excellent! Chief of gods and humans, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Venerable one, this is excellent! Hero among humans, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Your words are excellent! Great being, this is utterly excellent!</p>
<p>King of healers who dispels the poison of humans’ afflictions, this is excellent!</p>
<p>“Liberated being, this is excellent! One freed from the three existences, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Physician, this is excellent! Generous and sublime aide, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Glorious being, this is excellent! Auspicious and impartial one, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Fortunate one with a pure face like the sun and moon, this is excellent!</p>
<p>“Wise one with long and wide sapphire eyes, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Glorious one with a beautiful and marvelous nose, this is excellent!</p>
<p>Eloquent one with earlobes like golden plumb lines, this is excellent!</p>
<p>You with teeth white like snow or conch shells, this is excellent! Homage to you!</p>
<p>“O chief protector, this detailed exposition on generosity,</p>
<p>Which you have expounded so well to these people today, is excellent!</p>
<p>Now we wish to hear more about discipline, patience, power,</p>
<p>Wisdom, skillful means, concentration, miracles, and aspiration.”</p>
<p>At all that the Blessed One had spoken, the bodhisattvas Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, Avalokiteśvara, Crown Jewel of the Lord of Men Resembling a Sublime Lion Sporting and Roaring in Mountain Caves, Peaks, Clefts, Valleys, and Meadows, and the other bodhisattvas, along with the gods, the four great kings, and the world with all its gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the teachings of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra, “The Perfection of Generosity.”</p>
