<p>The Teaching on the Effulgence of Light</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Rājagṛha at Vulture Peak, together with a great saṅgha of five hundred monks who had all attained great independence, eight hundred billion bodhisattva great beings with only one birth remaining and led by Maitreya, and four hundred billion bodhisattva great beings led by Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta.</p>
<p>Present in the retinue at that time was Candraprabhakumārabhūta. He had been seated in the assembly, but he now rose from his seat, arranged his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One. With his palms respectfully joined together, he asked, “Blessed One, which activities did the Thus-Gone One previously perform to achieve his definitive light, magnetizing light, motivating light, manifesting light, multicolored light, single-colored light, narrow light, vast light, pure light, utterly pure light, stainless light, utterly stainless light, immaculate light, gradually expanding light, bright light, utterly bright light, boundless light, utterly boundless light,  immeasurable light, utterly immeasurable light, unfathomable light, utterly unfathomable light, swift light, utterly swift light, nonabiding light, groundless light, blazing light, illuminating light, inspiring light, light that leads to perfection, unimpeded light, unwavering light, straight light, light that dwells within the infinite, light displaying the marks of form, light displaying the various marks of form, light displaying the immeasurable marks of form, light displaying the characteristics of blue, yellow, red, and white colors, light displaying the characteristics of violet color, light displaying the characteristics of crystalline color, light displaying the characteristics of the sky’s color, and other such lights? Each of those various lights is manifested mixed with light rays of five colors, and each of those blue, yellow, red, and white lights are manifested mixed with an infinite number of multicolored light rays.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to Candraprabhakumārabhūta in verse:</p>
<p>“I have achieved those various lights</p>
<p>Since I have abandoned delusion</p>
<p>Through the causes and conditions</p>
<p>Of inconceivable virtuous actions.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I dwell on the path of the buddhas</p>
<p>Through a variety of practices,</p>
<p>And I manifest those mixed lights</p>
<p>Through the insight of emptiness and nonaction.</p>
<p>“Although external phenomena</p>
<p>Are empty and selfless,</p>
<p>Beyond actions and thoughts,</p>
<p>They appear with various particular characteristics.</p>
<p>“The inner body is also</p>
<p>Empty, selfless, and beyond action,</p>
<p>And yet all kinds of sounds</p>
<p>Manifest from it.</p>
<p>“In the same way, I fulfill the wishes of beings</p>
<p>In accordance with their inclinations,</p>
<p>By manifesting lights of countless colors</p>
<p>Through the power of nonaction.</p>

<p>“I have a light called foremost</p>
<p>That is praised by the thus-gone ones</p>
<p>And was perfected</p>
<p>By continuously revering the teachings of the Buddha.</p>
<p>“From all his pores, the Buddha emits light rays</p>
<p>As numerous as the beings he beholds,</p>
<p>And each of those light rays</p>
<p>Is surrounded by many attendants.</p>
<p>“As he emits those light rays,</p>
<p>The Buddha ripens sentient beings</p>
<p>In accordance with</p>
<p>Their individual inclinations.</p>
<p>“Whoever rejoices and feels inspired</p>
<p>Upon hearing this teaching on those lights</p>
<p>Must already have heard this discourse</p>
<p>From many buddhas in the past.</p>
<p>“I have a light called exalted</p>
<p>That has eight hundred million attendants;</p>
<p>I achieved this light by offering</p>
<p>One verse of praise to the buddhas in the past.</p>
<p>“I have a light called absence of sorrow</p>
<p>That has eight hundred billion attendants;</p>
<p>I achieved this light by recalling</p>
<p>A single teaching of a thus-gone one.</p>
<p>“I have a light called utmost purity</p>
<p>That has eight hundred million attendants;</p>
<p>I achieved this light</p>
<p>By mastering a single absorption.</p>
<p>“In the past, a buddha</p>
<p>Called Exalted</p>
<p>Appeared in the world.</p>
<p>His lifespan was immeasurable.</p>
<p>“When he first reached awakening,</p>
<p>The assembly that had gathered around him</p>
<p>And to whom he taught the Dharma</p>
<p>Counted eight hundred billion members.</p>
<p>“At that time, in the lands of the great Jambudvīpa,</p>
<p>There was a king called Devoted to Words.</p>
<p>He had five hundred sons who were handsome,</p>
<p>Beautiful, and pleasant to behold.</p>
<p>“Their father, the king,</p>
<p>Was a majestic and powerful man</p>
<p>Who had sincere faith</p>
<p>In the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>“Out of reverence,</p>
<p>The king offered to that blessed one</p>
<p>All the most magnificent gardens</p>
<p>That were in his possession.</p>
<p>“All the walkways</p>
<p>That crossed those gardens</p>
<p>Were lined with</p>
<p>Eight hundred million trees:</p>
<p>“Magnolia, banyan fig,</p>
<p>Kiṁśuka, goolar fig,</p>
<p>Śiriṣa, aśoka,</p>
<p>And other such trees.</p>
<p>“Those many trees blossomed during both summer and winter;</p>
<p>Their branches, fruits, and flowers shone with brilliant colors.</p>
<p>The sweetest fragrances arose from them</p>
<p>And perfumed the body of the Thus-Gone One.</p>
<p>“All the monks had a golden color.</p>
<p>They were all sitting in front of those trees.</p>
<p>They had all attained retention</p>
<p>Through great exertion.</p>
<p>“At that time, out of sympathy</p>
<p>For the king, his sons, and the numerous assemblies,</p>
<p>The Thus-Gone One taught them</p>
<p>The sūtra on the definitive lights.</p>
<p>“When he heard that sūtra,</p>
<p>The king, overwhelmed with joy,</p>
<p>Proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>In countless verses.</p>
<p>“That great king also offered the Blessed One</p>
<p>Eight hundred million magnificent bejeweled parasols,</p>
<p>Each of them decorated around its edge</p>
<p>By garlands of wish-fulfilling gems.</p>
<p>“Every one of them had the value</p>
<p>Of eight hundred million coins made of pure gold from the Jambu River.</p>
<p>Each of those bejeweled parasols was adorned</p>
<p>With tassels made of eight hundred million wish-fulfilling gems.</p>
<p>“Shining with brilliant colors,</p>
<p>Those wish-fulfilling gems emitted light continuously,</p>
<p>So that there was no distinction</p>
<p>Between day and night.</p>
<p>“Each of those light rays</p>
<p>Illuminated a hundred leagues,</p>
<p>And their light shone brilliantly,</p>
<p>Eclipsing the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>“The four sides of the precious parasols were ornamented</p>
<p>With lions and eight hundred million jewel tassels,</p>
<p>As well as eight hundred million garlands</p>
<p>Made of precious golden threads.</p>
<p>“Those sublime bejeweled parasols</p>
<p>Were also adorned</p>
<p>With lattices of precious pearls</p>
<p>That intermingled in various ways.</p>
<p>“Those parasols completely covered the gardens,</p>
<p>And they were themselves surmounted by countless lotus parasols</p>
<p>Formed by various kinds of flowers</p>
<p>Such as jasmine, atimuktaka—also known as mucilinda—</p>
<p>“Udumbara, and blue lotus flowers.</p>
<p>All those parasols were beautified with precious lattices,</p>
<p>And cloths made of golden threads</p>
<p>That formed a covering canopy above.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, eight hundred million bejeweled thrones</p>
<p>Built with sandalwood, supported by legs made of pure gold,</p>
<p>And decorated with eight hundred million</p>
<p>Cushions made of the finest silk were set forth.</p>
<p>“At that time, all types of sentient beings—</p>
<p>Up to those residing at the summit of existence—</p>
<p>Had gathered in that place to hear this discourse</p>
<p>From the Thus-Gone One.</p>
<p>“When they heard this discourse,</p>
<p>Gods, nāgas, yakṣas, the kings of the gandharvas,</p>
<p>Mahoragas, and asuras</p>
<p>Were overwhelmed with joy.</p>
<p>“They proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>In eight thousand verses,</p>
<p>And all of them made the aspiration</p>
<p>To reach great awakening.</p>
<p>“Filled with faith, the gods, the nāgas,</p>
<p>The asuras, and all the other beings</p>
<p>Showered rains of mandārava flowers</p>
<p>And precious pearls as offerings.</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,</p>
<p>All the eight hundred million powerful and majestic great gods</p>
<p>Were also overcome with joy, and made the aspiration to reach great awakening,</p>
<p>‘In the future, may we also achieve such a light!’</p>
<p>“At that moment, the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>Knew their thoughts</p>
<p>And prophesied their awakening in these words:</p>
<p>‘In the future, you will accomplish buddhahood.’</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse that reveals the lights in full,</p>
<p>Śakra—lord of the gods—Brahmā, and the eight hundred million members of their retinues</p>
<p>Also became overwhelmed with joy, gave rise to the mind set on awakening,</p>
<p>And received this prophecy: ‘In the future, you will accomplish buddhahood.’</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,</p>
<p>All the eight hundred million nāgas who had gathered there</p>
<p>Also gave rise to the mind set on awakening</p>
<p>And received a prophecy.</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,</p>
<p>All the eight hundred million garuḍa kings who had gathered there</p>
<p>Observed the five vows</p>
<p>And also received that prophecy.</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,</p>
<p>All the eight hundred million gandharva kings who had gathered there</p>
<p>Played a hundred thousand musical instruments, making delightful sounds</p>
<p>As offerings to the Blessed One, and also received that prophecy.</p>
<p>“At that time, upon hearing this discourse,</p>
<p>All the hundred million yakṣa kings developed intense faith</p>
<p>In the pure wisdom of the Buddha,</p>
<p>And all of them also received the prophecy of their awakening.</p>
<p>“Candraprabha, you should know that, at that time,</p>
<p>You were the king Devoted to Words,</p>
<p>Who worshiped that blessed one with those various offerings;</p>
<p>Do not think that this was someone else.</p>
<p>“You have already heard that sūtra in the past,</p>
<p>And this is the reason why today,</p>
<p>In this place, you once again</p>
<p>Request to hear it.</p>
<p>“After I pass into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>When the wheels of the sacred Dharma are about to cease,</p>
<p>Whoever develops faith in these Dharma teachings</p>
<p>Will be able to teach this discourse on a vast scale.</p>
<p>“Those who teach this discourse in the future</p>
<p>Will be the guardians of my Dharma;</p>
<p>Like leaders guiding many travelers,</p>
<p>They will be known as guardians of the precious treasure.</p>
<p>“Know that those who hear this discourse in the future</p>
<p>And become interested for a mere moment will be blessed by the Buddha and Mañjuśrī;</p>
<p>They will behold many buddhas, who will entrust secret teachings to them,</p>
<p>And their insight will become sharp.</p>

<p>In the future, during the final period,</p>
<p>Give rise to genuine recollection</p>
<p>And expound this discourse!</p>
<p>“I clearly see the future</p>
<p>With my buddha eyes;</p>
<p>I know precisely all the various actions</p>
<p>That will occur.</p>
<p>“I also know all the monks who,</p>
<p>In the pursuit of unsurpassed wisdom,</p>
<p>Will teach this discourse with minds filled with faith,</p>
<p>As well as all the directions in which this teaching will take place.</p>
<p>“I also know all the thoughts and methods of those who,</p>
<p>In the future, during the final period,</p>
<p>Will be interested in this discourse</p>
<p>Upon hearing it.</p>
<p>“I know all the inferior beings</p>
<p>Who will not hear this discourse</p>
<p>And who will therefore denigrate</p>
<p>The teachings of the Dharma.</p>
<p>“I will give a prophecy to all the monks and nuns</p>
<p>Who cry out of heartfelt longing</p>
<p>When they hear this discourse,</p>
<p>And they will behold the supreme victors.</p>
<p>“Candraprabha, you should know that,</p>
<p>Through my awakened miraculous power,</p>
<p>I know the purity and the impurity of beings’ minds,</p>
<p>And even all their inclinations.</p>
<p>“I know all the qualities of sentient beings,</p>
<p>Such as those who are always dedicated to peace and isolation,</p>
<p>Dwell in absorptions without any attachment to saṃsāra,</p>
<p>And have permanently abandoned even its habitual patterns.</p>
<p>“I know which sentient beings will, in the future,</p>
<p>Adhere to untrue teachings,</p>
<p>And which ones</p>
<p>Will be devoted to the Buddha.</p>
<p>“Beings who are attached to worldly pleasures</p>
<p>Will not properly grow the seed of the buddhas’ awakening;</p>
<p>Due to such causes and conditions,</p>
<p>Their practices will deteriorate.</p>
<p>“Candraprabha, those who realize the seed of awakening</p>
<p>Are certain to obtain pure, boundless lights.</p>
<p>Thus, regard each of the causes and conditions related to such lights distinctly;</p>
<p>You should perceive them all through the power of insight.</p>
<p>“Those who abandon unwholesome friends,</p>
<p>Who rely on virtuous friends,</p>
<p>And who guard the purity of their discipline</p>
<p>Will accomplish the lights of the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Guard your senses,</p>
<p>Abandon shamelessness and indecency,</p>
<p>Cultivate virtuous qualities,</p>
<p>And protect sentient beings!</p>
<p>“Stop being involved in conflicts,</p>
<p>Realize emptiness,</p>
<p>And develop erudition and eloquence</p>
<p>Without hankering for personal gain!</p>
<p>“Regard all personal achievements as being like fecal filth</p>
<p>And do not let the purity of your mind</p>
<p>Be defiled by the stains of selfish gains;</p>
<p>Pursue liberation and you will achieve the unsurpassed goal!</p>
<p>“Accomplish the path of the buddhas,</p>
<p>Regard the Buddha and reality as being similar,</p>
<p>Always set ablaze the great torch of the Dharma,</p>
<p>And illuminate all the worlds!</p>
<p>“Let your mind be unshakable</p>
<p>Like the king of mountains,</p>
<p>And eagerly cultivate patience toward everyone,</p>
<p>Even when you are insulted or beaten!</p>
<p>“Act as a genuine virtuous friend</p>
<p>For the sake of sentient beings,</p>
<p>Abandon all forms of inferior attitude,</p>
<p>And always accomplish pure actions!</p>
<p>“Let your mind be stable,</p>
<p>Teach the unsurpassed Dharma,</p>
<p>And bestow this sacred discourse</p>
<p>On the kindhearted!</p>
<p>“Those who pursue unsurpassed wisdom</p>
<p>Are not afraid of saṃsāra;</p>
<p>Having abandoned negative deeds,</p>
<p>They will gain the most supreme benefits.</p>
<p>“As an analogy, Candraprabha, you should know</p>
<p>That experts can skillfully handle fire,</p>
<p>To produce various flavors without being burned,</p>
<p>While unskilled dilettantes burn their palms when handling fire.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the disturbed and crazed mind</p>
<p>Of someone who has been poisoned</p>
<p>Can be cured by the heat of fire.</p>
<p>It is similar for the wise:</p>
<p>“Based on the mind, they see that the mind is empty.</p>
<p>Therefore, although they abide within saṃsāra,</p>
<p>They see—based on the eye—that the eye is empty,</p>
<p>And so they do not cling to the eye.</p>
<p>“Those who understand in that way</p>
<p>Can dwell on the eyes without causing affliction;</p>
<p>If they see that the eye is empty, they will achieve genuine wisdom,</p>
<p>And light rays will therefore manifest.</p>
<p>“If they see that the eye is empty,</p>
<p>They will permanently abandon desire.</p>
<p>Due to this absence of desire,</p>
<p>Light rays will manifest.</p>
<p>“What is explained here with respect to desire also applies</p>
<p>To all the other afflictions up to anger,</p>
<p>Ignorance, clinging to “I,” pretense,</p>
<p>Aggression, miserliness, envy,</p>
<p>“Shamelessness, impatience,</p>
<p>Haughtiness, arrogance,</p>
<p>Pride, deceit,</p>
<p>Carelessness, dishonesty, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Those who obtain genuine wisdom</p>
<p>Realize the eye to be peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, light rays will manifest</p>
<p>Through this realization.</p>
<p>“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom</p>
<p>Are settled in the way of the buddhas,</p>
<p>And light rays will manifest</p>
<p>On this basis.</p>
<p>“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom</p>
<p>Are settled in the methods of the buddhas,</p>
<p>And light rays will manifest</p>
<p>On this basis.</p>
<p>“I have never heard of or seen</p>
<p>Anyone who has permanently abandoned the obscurations</p>
<p>And accomplished the manifestation of light rays</p>
<p>Without achieving genuine wisdom.</p>
<p>“Those who, after realizing genuine wisdom,</p>
<p>Permanently rid themselves of the harm of the obscurations</p>
<p>And observe this conduct</p>
<p>Will achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who pursue the conduct of the victors</p>
<p>And worship the thus-gone ones</p>
<p>After having trained in this discourse</p>
<p>Will achieve genuine wisdom and skillful means.</p>
<p>“Those who have achieved genuine wisdom</p>
<p>Should worship the buddhas</p>
<p>To perfect the emanation of light rays</p>
<p>Like fruits in the palms of their hands.</p>
<p>“For those who are deluded</p>
<p>About the selflessness of the eye,</p>
<p>The qualities of spiritual training will decline;</p>
<p>Those persons will not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“It is those who realize</p>
<p>The selflessness of the eye</p>
<p>Who accomplish the qualities of virtuous practice;</p>
<p>Such persons will achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Will also realize the limit of the arising of the ear.</p>
<p>Realizing the limit of the arising of the ear</p>
<p>Is known as the quality of great virtuous practice.</p>
<p>“Those who do not understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also not understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who understand the ultimate essence of the eye</p>
<p>Will also understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who do not properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also not properly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also properly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who do not directly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also not directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who directly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who do not properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also not fully understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who properly understand the limit of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will also directly understand the limit of the arising of the eye;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who do not properly understand the purity of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will not properly understand the purity of the ear’s natural state;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Not achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Those who properly understand the purity of the eye’s natural state</p>
<p>Will properly realize the purity of the ear’s natural state;</p>
<p>Those persons will therefore</p>
<p>Achieve the emanation of light rays.</p>
<p>“Know that this also applies</p>
<p>To the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes,</p>
<p>Textures, and mental phenomena.</p>
<p>“It also applies to the elements of earth, water, fire, and air,</p>
<p>The world, suffering,</p>
<p>The aggregates, elements, mundane sense sources,</p>
<p>Words, names, and so forth.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Candraprabhakumārabhūta, “Noble son, sentient beings dedicated to the Great Vehicle who wish to perfect this emanation of light rays must accomplish eighty types of accumulation of roots of virtue. What are those eighty? (1) Protecting and recollecting sentient beings, (2) being free of ill will, (3) guarding the purity of one’s discipline without letting it become corrupted, (4) being completely impartial, (5) being free of deceit, (6) being free of miserliness, (7) being free of envy, (8) being free of lustful thoughts, (9) being free of deceitful thoughts, (10) trusting the sacred discourses of the Great Vehicle, (11) being free of attachment and craving regarding power and arrogance, (12) having complete strength of patience, (13) never turning away from one’s aspirations, (14) having a completely pure motivation, (15) staying in the wilderness, (16) not associating with retinues, (17) not being thrilled about personal gains, (18) not being excited about fame, (19) dwelling firmly in the concentrations, (20) displaying the absorption of light rays, (21) sincerely revering those who observe discipline, (22) manifesting the noblest attitude toward those who practice pure conduct, (23) venerating the preceptors and teachers out of respect for the Dharma, (24) understanding the meaning of the sūtras, (25) being expert in teaching, (26) not telling lies, (27) maintaining pure motivation, (28) exerting oneself to create roots of virtue, (29) constantly practicing generosity, (30) fully understanding the activities of Māra, (31) guarding one’s senses firmly, (32) investigating the words, (33) being expert in the ultimate truth, (34) realizing the individual characteristics of the bodhisattva levels, (35) pursuing inexhaustible form, (36) being unconcerned about one’s body and life, (37) teaching to the four retinues,  (38) completely interrupting worldly concerns, (39) abandoning the wrong view that denies future existence, (40) abstaining from teaching those who are untrained and show signs of dishonesty, (41) teaching those who wish to train, to the best of one’s ability and with discernment, (42) not proclaiming the praises of song and music, (43) not proclaiming the praises of ornaments and provisions, (44) correctly engaging in the truths, (45) possessing excellent erudition, (46) giving up drowsiness, (47) exerting oneself in the pursuit of the genuine Dharma, (48) revering the buddhas, (49) giving rise to the mind set on awakening, (50) giving up worldly activities, (51) exerting oneself in the precepts, (52) relying on extraordinary friends out of thirst for the Dharma, (53) untiringly pursuing roots of virtue, (54) being highly interested in monastic ordination, (55) guarding and upholding the Dharma of the buddhas, (56) not engaging in negative actions, (57) having no doubts about the teachings, (58) being skilled in teaching through analogies, (59) revealing and disclosing secrets, (60) tirelessly pursuing great awakening, (61) not forgetting the sūtras one has received, (62) not giving up one’s training, (63) defeating the proponents of opposing views, (64) pursuing the path of renunciation, (65) accomplishing countless activities, (66) gaining certainty about the wisdom of the Dharma, (67) clearly perceiving the principle of causes and results, (68) continuously remaining in saṃsāra, (69) not being attached to the three realms, (70) giving up pride, (71) teaching the presentation of the antidotes to those who have strong conviction, (72) fully understanding the particular instances of future karmic ripening, (73) properly knowing the past limit, (74) not being dependent on others,  (75) diligently accomplishing the practices of abandonment, and (76) perfecting the arrays of the buddhas’ major and minor marks—those are the eighty types of accumulation.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, Candraprabhakumāra, those eighty qualities can be included within five qualities. What are those five? (1) Knowing saṃsāra, (2) knowing nirvāṇa, (3) knowing the exhaustion of afflictions, (4) knowing what is supreme, and (5) knowing the fruition of merit.</p>
<p>“Candraprabhakumāra, those five qualities can further be included within two qualities. What are those two? (1) Being adorned with a pure mind and (2) being adorned with a pure appearance.</p>
<p>“Candraprabhakumāra, those two qualities can further be included within a single quality. What is this quality? Accomplishing the unimpeded liberation of the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, Candraprabhakumāra, there is another set of eighty qualities, through which one perfects the unimpeded liberation of the thus-gone ones. What are those eighty? (1) Being endowed with the accumulation of generosity, (2) being endowed with vast insight, (3) accomplishing pure discipline, (4) being free from the torment of the afflictions, (5) overcoming pride, (6) speaking with soft words, (7) knowing a variety of topics, (8) knowing those who are virtuous friends, (9) dedicating oneself to the Great Vehicle, (10) donning the armor of diligence, (11) taming sentient beings through one’s behavior, (12) eliminating the doubts of those who have fallen into afflicted states, (13) disparaging nonvirtue and accomplishing wholesome qualities, (14) not associating with nonvirtuous friends, (15) tirelessly creating roots of virtue, (16) giving rise to the mind set on awakening,  (17) engendering diligence, (18) clearly understanding the character of Māra, (19) realizing the truths, (20) worshiping only what is genuine, (21) eliminating doubts, (22) constantly wishing to make sentient beings pass beyond suffering, (23) not clinging to existence, (24) expanding the scope of one’s mind, (25) teaching about shortcomings to beings who engage in nonvirtue, (26) completely abandoning desire, anger, and ignorance, (27) not pursuing sense pleasures, (28) ripening sentient beings, (29) building stūpas of thus-gone ones, (30) developing one’s reverence toward noble beings, (31) associating with and serving those who are grounded in the Great Vehicle, (32) not praising those who follow the Lower Vehicle, (33) staying far away from those who follow the vehicle of the hearers, (34) overcoming opponents, (35) preparing vast offerings and offering them to the blessed buddhas with a noble attitude, (36) achieving unimpeded wisdom, (37) being endowed with perfect eloquence, (38) teaching the authentic Dharma through a variety of analogies, (39) not contradicting the empty essence, (40) not succumbing to laziness while pursuing the Dharma, (41) teaching the profound meaning, (42) possessing the great power of retention, (43) teaching the Dharma but not clinging to it, (44) propagating the Dharma on a vast scale, (45) insatiably guiding beings, (46) perfecting one’s modes of conduct, (47) being endowed with great majesty, (48) being endowed with unimpeded eloquence, (49) being endowed with excellent erudition, (50) not proclaiming the praises of nonvirtuous people, (51) accomplishing virtuous actions, (52) comprehending the aggregates, (53) completely giving up views, (54) realizing the essential nature of causes, (55) transcending the domain of experience,  (56) giving up improper domains, (57) developing intense faith, (58) dwelling on the genuine path, (59) delighting in the Great Vehicle, (60) attracting beings impartially, (61) not being attached to selflessness, (62) not becoming weary about saṃsāra, (63) being dedicated to seeking nirvāṇa, (64) staying in the wilderness because of having few desires, (65) never succumbing to laziness while collecting alms, (66) being content with whatever one gets, (67) giving up shamelessness and indecency, (68) serving the buddhas, (69) staying in the presence of virtuous friends, (70) staying away from those who are not of the same ilk, (71) being sympathetic toward ordinary beings, (72) acting in conformity with sentient beings’ way of behaving, (73) having great faith in the buddhas, (74) abandoning those who are improper vessels, (75) not giving teachings to inappropriate beings, (76) not teaching those who do not ask for it, (77) teaching in a variety of ways to those who ask for it, (78) being disinterested with respect to food, (79) giving continuously and impartially, and (80) giving without holding anything back— Kumāra, those are the eighty qualities through which one achieves the unimpeded liberation of the thus-gone ones.”</p>
<p>When he heard that teaching, Candraprabhakumārabhūta became overjoyed and spoke these verses of praise in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One knows</p>
<p>The limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>He displays pure wisdom</p>
<p>And is therefore endowed with pure and perfect lights.</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One knows</p>
<p>The selflessness of the eye,</p>
<p>He speaks with a pure voice</p>
<p>And is therefore endowed with the perfect voice of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One</p>
<p>Has benefited sentient beings in the past,</p>
<p>He has perfected pure speech,</p>
<p>And he therefore benefits an infinity of worlds.</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One knows</p>
<p>The emptiness of the eye,</p>
<p>He has perfected all-comprehending wisdom,</p>
<p>And therefore displays the Thus-Gone One’s infinite lights.</p>
<p>“The Buddha knows the characteristics of the eye,</p>
<p>And those particularities are endless;</p>
<p>Thus, since the names of wisdom are infinite,</p>
<p>The lights displayed by the Thus-Gone One are infinite.</p>
<p>“Since the Buddha knows</p>
<p>The gateways of the particular words,</p>
<p>He realizes that the eye is empty and beyond words,</p>
<p>And he therefore displays infinite lights.</p>
<p>“Those who contemplate the selflessness of the eye</p>
<p>Will realize that the Buddha speaks the truth,</p>
<p>And they will therefore display the certainty</p>
<p>Of the Thus-Gone One’s lights.</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One</p>
<p>Has perfected the most sublime miraculous powers,</p>
<p>He understands the boundless disintegration of the eye,</p>
<p>And he therefore benefits all the worlds.</p>
<p>“The great compassionate one, foremost among human beings,</p>
<p>Knows the boundless arising of the eye;</p>
<p>May I too, before long,</p>
<p>Know the arising of the eye as the Blessed One does!</p>
<p>“In the same way, his knowledge encompasses</p>

<p>Aware of Candraprabhakumārabhūta’s thoughts, the Blessed One smiled and emitted golden light rays that illuminated countless buddha realms and accomplished the benefit of beings within the worldly realms. Then those light rays circumambulated the Blessed One three times and vanished into the top of the Thus-Gone One’s head.</p>
<p>At that moment, the bodhisattva Maitreya stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One. With his palms respectfully joined together,  he praised the Blessed One and posed some questions with these verses:</p>
<p>“You roar like thunder and like a lion,</p>
<p>Your voice resembles the song of the kalaviṅka bird,</p>
<p>And you beat the great Dharma drums.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“You shine more brightly than a thousand suns,</p>
<p>Your voice is immaculate,</p>
<p>And you possess the most amazing qualities.</p>
<p>Why did you emit light?</p>
<p>“You are adorned with generosity, discipline, patience,</p>
<p>Diligence, concentration, and insight.</p>
<p>You have mastered all those perfections.</p>
<p>Why did you emit light?</p>
<p>“Thus-Gone One, your voice is soft,</p>
<p>You have permanently abandoned harsh words,</p>
<p>And you heal the diseases of sentient beings.</p>
<p>Why did you emit light?</p>
<p>“Great compassionate one, leader of human beings,</p>
<p>You realize that the eye is always empty and void,</p>
<p>And you teach the Dharma to sentient beings</p>
<p>With your pure Brahmā voice.</p>
<p>“The same applies to the ear, the nose, the tongue,</p>
<p>The body, the mind, words, names, and so forth,</p>
<p>Up to the origin, cessation,</p>
<p>The path, wisdom, and patience.</p>
<p>“Great compassionate one, leader of human beings,</p>
<p>You realize that the limits of the arising and exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>And complete peace, as well as saṃsāra,</p>
<p>Are empty and void.</p>
<p>“The same applies to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“You also teach that dependently arisen phenomena</p>
<p>Are beyond permanence and discontinuation,</p>
<p>And that they are not produced by themselves or by others,</p>
<p>But that they originate from numerous conditions.</p>
<p>“At times, you describe the basis of suffering</p>
<p>Using various explanations.</p>
<p>At times, you praise the light of the buddhas</p>
<p>According to a variety of meanings.</p>
<p>“At times, you teach about the disengagement of phenomena</p>
<p>Using countless words.</p>
<p>At times, you reveal the nonexistence</p>
<p>Of a person, a life principle, a self, and a sentient being.</p>
<p>“Countless buddhas of the past</p>
<p>Have also taught this Dharma</p>
<p>Through hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>Of inconceivable verses.</p>
<p>“The Thus-Gone One teaches</p>
<p>About qualities, the Dharma, and the natural state,</p>
<p>But he is beyond expressions and things expressed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Dharma that he expresses is also nonexistent.</p>
<p>“Blessed One, since you induce understanding in beings</p>
<p>By teaching the true Dharma,</p>
<p>The gods and yakṣas who hear your teachings</p>
<p>Will gain understanding.</p>
<p>“Likewise, all the asuras</p>
<p>Will develop sincere interest,</p>
<p>And countless humans</p>
<p>Will cut through the web of doubt.</p>
<p>“They will realize the nature of desire,</p>
<p>Eradicate anger and ignorance,</p>
<p>And completely abandon</p>
<p>The entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p>“Suffering comes from the proliferation</p>
<p>Of craving, pride,</p>
<p>Ignorance, deceit, and envy;</p>
<p>Ultimately, all those categories are pure.</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One clearly knows</p>
<p>The many terms related to every single Dharma teaching,</p>
<p>He delivers countless</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of teachings.</p>
<p>“Since he has properly trained in the Dharma</p>
<p>Under countless buddhas,</p>
<p>The words he expresses to teach</p>
<p>Every single Dharma topic are endless.</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One knows</p>
<p>The many categories of phenomena,</p>
<p>He clearly understands the distinctions pertaining</p>
<p>To initial, intermediate, and concluding statements.</p>
<p>“Since he has learned</p>
<p>All the varieties of different words,</p>
<p>He clearly knows how to teach</p>
<p>The excellent, supreme meanings.</p>
<p>“Since such a completely pure voice</p>
<p>Originates from a collection of causes and conditions,</p>
<p>It does not depend on the tongue alone,</p>
<p>Or on the body and the mind alone.</p>
<p>“The earth has shaken in six ways,</p>
<p>And retinues have gathered from the ten directions.</p>
<p>When they gaze upon the Blessed One, their palms joined,</p>
<p>May their doubts be cleared away!</p>
<p>“The Thus-Gone One realizes</p>
<p>That the limits of the exhaustion and arising of the eye</p>
<p>Are always intrinsically empty and void,</p>
<p>Beyond coming and going.</p>
<p>“He dwells within the very limit of reality,</p>
<p>Beyond abiding and fixation.</p>
<p>Blessed One, your eye is unimpeded,</p>
<p>So I ask you this today:</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One realizes</p>
<p>That the past and future limits of the eye,</p>
<p>Its exhaustion and its non-exhaustion, as well as saṃsāra,</p>
<p>Are intrinsically empty and void,</p>
<p>“He brings delight to worldly beings</p>
<p>By revealing the meanings of the Dharma.</p>
<p>Why does the sage, who is endowed</p>
<p>With that melodious voice, smile?</p>
<p>“Blessed One, you realize that the past and future limits,</p>
<p>As well as the eye, are empty and void,</p>
<p>And you are free from concepts and words.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“Blessed One, you know that the eye is beyond measure,</p>
<p>And that the various verbal expressions</p>
<p>Are always empty and void by nature.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“Blessed One, you clearly know that the limits of exhaustion and arising,</p>
<p>As well as the eye itself, are empty and void,</p>
<p>And you have completely</p>
<p>Abandoned all afflictions.</p>
<p>“You have obtained the wisdom</p>
<p>Of the buddhas’ awakening,</p>
<p>And you have an excellent and supreme renown.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“Blessed One, since you have trained for a long time,</p>
<p>You teach the inconceivable.</p>
<p>You realize the emptiness of the eye,</p>
<p>And you are always stainless and immaculate.</p>
<p>“You know all the countless thoughts</p>
<p>Through a single realization.</p>
<p>As your light rays illuminate the worlds,</p>
<p>What do these omens portend?</p>
<p>“Great Sage, manifest Buddha,</p>
<p>Exalted leader of human beings,</p>
<p>Since you have eliminated all afflictions,</p>
<p>Your mind is always peaceful and disengaged.</p>
<p>“Thus-Gone One, with your supreme wisdom</p>
<p>You know the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>Due to what causes and conditions</p>
<p>Do you smile today?</p>
<p>“The same applies to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>The six sense objects, and the four great elements,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“Blessed One, you realize that the eye is selfless,</p>

<p>“Blessed One, you realize that wisdom is selfless,</p>
<p>That disengagement is impermanent,</p>
<p>And that sentient beings are empty.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“Blessed One, you realize that any nature lacks inherent nature,</p>
<p>That the self is devoid of self,</p>
<p>And that inclinations are empty.</p>
<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“You see that saṃsāra is selfless,</p>
<p>You know what is permanent and impermanent,</p>

<p>Why do you smile?</p>
<p>“Thus-Gone One, your mind is free,</p>
<p>Your renown pervades the entirety of the three realms,</p>
<p>And you are worshiped by all beings,</p>
<p>Such as Śakra, the rulers of human beings, and nāgas.</p>
<p>“The Thus-Gone One realizes</p>

<p>And arising of the eye are void.</p>
<p>Why does he smile?</p>
<p>“All the countless heirs of the buddhas</p>
<p>Have gathered in this retinue.</p>

<p>You have achieved those various arrays of excellent marks.</p>
<p>“Your form body is perfect and unequaled,</p>
<p>The marks that beautify your face are magnificent,</p>
<p>And you benefit the world through your miraculous powers.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Your calves are similar to the calves of antelope,</p>
<p>And the shape of your body resembles that of a lion.</p>
<p>You appear within the worlds and illuminate them.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Like a stallion, your genitals are hidden and stainless;</p>
<p>The palms of your hands are even and broad,</p>
<p>And your arms reach past your knees.</p>
<p>Amazing and magnificent lion of human beings, please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Innumerable brilliant, soothing, and brightly colored light rays</p>
<p>Radiate from your body.</p>
<p>Your pure mind is uninterrupted,</p>
<p>And you reveal countless discourses.</p>
<p>“Such qualities will not be accomplished</p>
<p>By those who uphold eternalist or nihilist views.</p>
<p>Only those who have abandoned extreme views</p>
<p>Will swiftly attain the pure body of the blessed ones.</p>
<p>“Your speech resounds like divine drums and roaring thunder;</p>
<p>It is melodious and clear like the songs of the kalandaka bird</p>
<p>And endowed with a hundred thousand tunes of divine songs.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you emitted lights!</p>
<p>“Great Guide, by teaching the Dharma through a single teaching,</p>
<p>You interrupt the practices of those who adhere to improper discipline.</p>
<p>Whatever melodious words come from the Thus-Gone One’s mouth</p>
<p>Are profound and amazing!</p>
<p>“Leader of human beings, the light rays emitted from between your eyebrows</p>
<p>Illuminate a hundred thousand buddha realms,</p>
<p>Your sublime eyes have a deep black color,</p>
<p>And the mark of your crown protuberance cannot be seen by the celestial gods.</p>
<p>“Your forty teeth,</p>
<p>White like crystal,</p>
<p>Are the manifestation of your immeasurable virtuous activities.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Thus-Gone One, your body of perfect qualities</p>
<p>Shines with countless excellent and magnificent colors</p>
<p>And emits the most amazing pure light rays.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Great compassionate one, supreme victor, leader of human beings,</p>
<p>You know the pure intentions of sentient beings,</p>
<p>And you have achieved supreme, unimpeded eloquence.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Since the Thus-Gone One has reached the other shore,</p>
<p>He is perfectly endowed with the three knowledges and the six higher perceptions,</p>
<p>And he displays innumerable pure light rays.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Blessed One, during countless eons in the past,</p>
<p>You worshiped a hundred thousand blessed ones,</p>
<p>And the fruition of such causes is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Blessed One, since for countless eons in the past</p>
<p>You have dwelled within supreme states of absorption,</p>
<p>You have realized the limits of the arising and exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!</p>
<p>“Great guide, you clearly know</p>
<p>The past, the future, and the present—</p>
<p>Your immaculate wisdom is unimpeded and inconceivable,</p>
<p>Please tell us why you smile!”</p>
<p>At that moment, in front of the numerous retinues, the Blessed One extended his golden hand, placed it on Candraprabhakumārabhūta’s head, and spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Kumāra, listen carefully!</p>
<p>I now entrust to you</p>
<p>This teaching on awakening—</p>
<p>The sūtra on the manifestation of lights.</p>
<p>“In the future, during the final period</p>
<p>Of the degenerate times,</p>
<p>When the Dharma is about to vanish,</p>
<p>You must reveal it and expound it to sentient beings!</p>
<p>“With my buddha eye, I see and know</p>
<p>All those who, in the future, during the final period,</p>
<p>Will be interested in this excellent, profound, and sacred sūtra,</p>
<p>As well as all those who will not be interested in it.</p>
<p>“Sentient beings who pursue</p>
<p>The path of awakening</p>
<p>Should constantly recollect the Buddha</p>
<p>And keep this discourse in mind.</p>
<p>“Those whose faith has disappeared,</p>
<p>Who are attracted to distraction,</p>
<p>And who delight in sleeping both day and night</p>
<p>Will not be interested in this discourse.</p>
<p>“Even if they become renunciants</p>
<p>Under my teachings,</p>
<p>Interest in the qualities of nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Will not arise in them.</p>
<p>“Those fools will squander the gifts of faith,</p>
<p>And even if they hear repeatedly</p>
<p>About the defects associated with conditioned phenomena,</p>
<p>They will cling to worldly concerns, and fear will not arise in them.</p>
<p>“Those fools</p>
<p>Will deprecate the wise ones,</p>
<p>And even if they wear the Dharma robes,</p>
<p>They will be devoid of even the slightest trace of insight.</p>
<p>“Since they will not know the true words</p>
<p>Well-spoken by the Sage,</p>
<p>And even if they hear them, they will not believe in them,</p>
<p>Do not stay in the company of such fools!</p>
<p>“Even if they hear these magnificent teachings,</p>
<p>Joy and devotion will not arise in their minds.</p>
<p>I reproach such individuals;</p>
<p>Though they have a human body, they waste it in meaningless pursuits.</p>
<p>“Those whose minds become filled with joy and devotion</p>
<p>When they hear these profound teachings</p>
<p>Have already met buddhas in the past.</p>
<p>There is thus no doubt that they will reach unsurpassed awakening.</p>
<p>“Fools who are inferior due to their unwholesome views</p>
<p>And sever the life force of insight will forsake awakening;</p>
<p>Therefore, abandon such nonvirtuous friends</p>
<p>And instead attend to the wise ones and revere them!</p>
<p>“All the innumerable defects in all the worlds,</p>
<p>And all sentient beings sinking in the three lower realms,</p>
<p>Originate from the causes and conditions of ignorance and delusion;</p>
<p>Therefore, those who follow their afflictions will not gain freedom.</p>
<p>“Since they forsake the true Dharma</p>
<p>And practice what is contrary to the Dharma,</p>
<p>You should abandon</p>
<p>Those inferior, deluded beings!</p>
<p>“Like a charioteer breaking</p>
<p>The axle of his steering wheels,</p>
<p>Sentient beings who engage in nonvirtuous actions</p>
<p>Will be reborn in the hell realms.</p>
<p>“Abusive words always come back to harm</p>
<p>Those who pronounce them,</p>
<p>Just like a sharp axe that strikes the body</p>
<p>Of the one who wields it.</p>
<p>“Karmic ripening is experienced without fail,</p>
<p>In accordance with the causes and conditions of the actions performed.</p>
<p>Those who do not understand this will attend to worldly sages,</p>
<p>Thinking they are virtuous friends.</p>
<p>“Then, thinking that those who meditate on emptiness</p>
<p>Realize the unconditioned, they will develop nihilist views;</p>
<p>They will say that the body becomes like a broken pot</p>
<p>And that the mind also ceases to be.</p>
<p>“They will mostly be drawn</p>
<p>To idle gossip,</p>
<p>And, strongly attached to it,</p>
<p>They will gain no benefits whatsoever.</p>
<p>“The harm caused by poisonous snakes</p>
<p>Will never cause many beings to fall into the lower realms,</p>
<p>But when a fool teaches the Dharma he destroys roots of virtue,</p>
<p>Which causes countless beings to fall into the hell realms.</p>
<p>“You who have gathered in this assembly should consider</p>
<p>That Candraprabhakumāra, who is present here today,</p>
<p>Has worshiped and venerated countless blessed buddhas in the past—</p>
<p>As many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>“Since he has pursued unsurpassed wisdom</p>
<p>By meditating in a steadfast manner,</p>
<p>His mind does not dwell</p>
<p>On any of the realms of existence.</p>
<p>“Since he knows that the limit of the arising of the eye</p>
<p>Is always pure,</p>
<p>He has abandoned concepts,</p>
<p>And he is utterly free from clinging.</p>
<p>“He will teach this unsurpassed sūtra</p>
<p>On the manifestation of lights</p>
<p>In order to benefit</p>
<p>Countless sentient beings.</p>
<p>“Since fools are unable to train in this teaching,</p>
<p>They regard genuine spiritual practices as faulty.</p>
<p>Therefore, stay far away from such fools;</p>
<p>Do not assist them, and do not train in their teachings!</p>
<p>“Since fools are attracted to dispute,</p>
<p>They are unable to earnestly adopt behavior that is free from conflict.</p>
<p>Such beings are utterly devoid of an appropriate mindset,</p>
<p>So do not serve them or proclaim their praise!</p>
<p>“Since fools are lazy and indolent by nature,</p>
<p>They constantly engage in physical, verbal, and mental nonvirtuous actions;</p>
<p>They therefore completely lack</p>
<p>Pure discipline, insight, and erudition.</p>
<p>“They always think about the objects of their desires,</p>
<p>And they are drawn to distractions;</p>
<p>Regard the families, blood lines,</p>
<p>And bodies of such fools as inferior!</p>
<p>“They are filled with aggression, they do not listen to advice,</p>
<p>And their faces are repulsive;</p>
<p>Even if they are born in virtuous locations,</p>
<p>Their bodies will be vile.</p>
<p>“Since they cling to the notion of self, they are deluded about the true meaning.</p>
<p>Since they lack intelligence, they are unable to understand the diversity of words.</p>
<p>Even if they hear teachings about intrinsic emptiness,</p>
<p>They are not interested in them.</p>
<p>“The thus-gone ones, the blessed ones</p>
<p>Have long ago abandoned all worldly verbal constructs.</p>
<p>Ordinary beings cling and are attached to those,</p>
<p>And so, for as long as they live, they fail to gain understanding and realization.</p>
<p>“Though they might proclaim the praises of discipline,</p>
<p>They do not practice pure conduct.</p>
<p>Though their mouths might teach the Dharma,</p>
<p>Their bodies engage in practices that are contrary to it.</p>
<p>“Though they might teach the Vinaya,</p>
<p>They always behave in ways that are contrary to it.</p>
<p>The Buddha has instructed his disciples</p>
<p>To wear the saffron-colored robes.</p>
<p>“Still, even if those who observe improper discipline</p>
<p>Put on such robes,</p>
<p>It only causes the strength of pride and carelessness</p>
<p>To grow in their minds.</p>
<p>“When they eat the food that is donated to them with faith,</p>
<p>It is like swallowing burning iron.</p>
<p>In that way, after renouncing their households,</p>
<p>They do not experience sense pleasures,</p>
<p>“Nor do they gain the supreme happiness</p>
<p>Associated with the Dharma of the buddhas.</p>
<p>In this way, they aspire for a variety of experiences</p>
<p>And do not abandon the two extremes.</p>
<p>“None of their interests are pure,</p>
<p>And even when such fools are in a large retinue,</p>
<p>They are like foxes</p>
<p>That have entered a pack of lions.</p>
<p>“Even if you give</p>
<p>Teachings related to peace,</p>
<p>They do not understand or realize</p>
<p>The meaning of suchness and emptiness.</p>
<p>“Even if their teachings are praised in large retinues,</p>
<p>This only causes their arrogance to increase;</p>
<p>Since they do not recollect the great teacher,</p>
<p>They lack modesty and humility.</p>
<p>“Even when they take hold of impure objects,</p>
<p>They joyfully hold on to them</p>
<p>As if they were wish-fulfilling gems,</p>
<p>And their minds never let go of them.</p>
<p>“Though such vile beings</p>
<p>Might renounce their households,</p>
<p>Guard their behavior, put on Dharma robes,</p>
<p>And carry alms bowls,</p>
<p>“These are all merely superficial displays,</p>
<p>And so they utterly lack true insight.</p>
<p>Even if they shave their facial hairs,</p>
<p>They do not renounce harmful attitudes.</p>
<p>“Since they follow teachings contrary to virtuous practice</p>
<p>And fall into mistaken views,</p>
<p>The path leading to disengagement and nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Is completely ruined for them.</p>
<p>“They will not achieve the fruition</p>
<p>Resulting from engaging in virtuous practice,</p>
<p>And so their ignorance and other afflictions</p>
<p>Will not diminish in the slightest.</p>
<p>“While roaming in the cities,</p>
<p>They sing the praise of disengagement.</p>
<p>Due to their lack of intelligence,</p>
<p>Those fools do not understand the genuine path.</p>
<p>“All their aspirations are nonvirtuous;</p>
<p>Even if they stay in the wilderness,</p>
<p>It is not to accomplish the true causes of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>But out of desire for personal gain.</p>
<p>“Fond of drowsiness and sleep,</p>
<p>They are concerned about their physical well-being</p>
<p>And constantly long</p>
<p>For ways to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>“Even if they stay in the wilderness for many years,</p>
<p>They adhere to mistaken views,</p>
<p>And so they stray from the path leading to nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Never obtaining the results of the paths of virtuous practice.</p>
<p>“Since they regress from the genuine view</p>
<p>And transgress pure discipline,</p>
<p>They always crave fine clothes to adorn their bodies,</p>
<p>And for the happiness of sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>“When they enter cities,</p>
<p>They bear the marks of pride</p>
<p>And do not guard their physical actions,</p>
<p>And so they do not observe pure conduct.</p>
<p>“At times, when they enter cities and roam about,</p>
<p>They boast about their characteristics in these words:</p>
<p>‘You should know that the caves in the wilderness are my home.</p>
<p>My eyes downcast, I glance upward slowly, walking and stopping serenely.’</p>
<p>“Since they do indeed look like worthy ones,</p>
<p>All the householders say to one another,</p>
<p>‘This monk who stays in the wilderness</p>
<p>Is truly a noble being!’</p>
<p>“At other times, when visitors come to see them</p>
<p>While they stay in the forest, they brag in words such as these:</p>
<p>‘In these jungles I wander day and night’</p>
<p>Or ‘This mat of fresh grass is where I sit.’</p>
<p>“At other times, when they go to cities and enter homes,</p>
<p>They eagerly ask with deception, ‘Are you well?’</p>
<p>Before engaging in frivolous mundane conversations</p>
<p>Related to various topics such as kings and thieves.</p>
<p>“At other times, driven by attachment,</p>
<p>They boast about their own qualities</p>
<p>In various ways</p>
<p>In the presence of women.</p>
<p>“They say, ‘I am a great field of merit for the entire world;</p>
<p>I have renounced my kingdom and become a renunciant,</p>
<p>And now I meditate on the path.</p>
<p>My queen and my children have been reborn in the higher realms.’</p>
<p>“Upon hearing those words,</p>
<p>The women are filled with immense respect;</p>
<p>They collect clothes, food, and beverages, which they offer with the words,</p>
<p>‘Venerable, look upon us with compassion—please come to us directly!’</p>
<p>“Since such people are attached to delicious meals</p>
<p>And do not know their defects,</p>
<p>They are at the mercy of Māra,</p>
<p>Like turtles caught in nets.</p>
<p>“Even while staying in the wilderness,</p>
<p>They are conceited about their achievements,</p>
<p>And they continue to despise and deprecate</p>
<p>Those monks who are diligent.</p>
<p>“Since they repeatedly give rise to attachment</p>
<p>Out of the delusion related to gain and fame,</p>
<p>And since they constantly engage in deceitful actions to sustain themselves,</p>
<p>They repeatedly increase their physical and verbal unwholesome actions.</p>
<p>“Even if benefactors make offerings to them out of faith,</p>
<p>Their merit will decrease through the power of their laziness.</p>
<p>Since those fools always long for nonvirtue,</p>
<p>They will never reach the acceptance that accords with emptiness.</p>
<p>“For those who completely abandon those faults</p>
<p>On the basis of my teachings</p>
<p>And practice with zeal and conscientiousness,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to hear this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who are unshaken by worldly concerns</p>
<p>Such as gain, loss, praise, criticism,</p>
<p>Suffering, and happiness,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who perceive the body as filth,</p>
<p>The aggregates as wounds,</p>
<p>And food as poison for the wounds,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who do not become haughty</p>
<p>But put on the attire of modesty</p>
<p>Even when they receive fine clothes,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who are not conceited about their appearance and strength,</p>
<p>Who are not attached to food</p>
<p>But merely eat to sustain their lives,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who know that the objects of craving are empty</p>
<p>And therefore neither indulge in nor reject pleasures</p>
<p>But always act with the understanding of emptiness and disengagement,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those living alone in the mountains—more than a league away—</p>
<p>Who, while absorbed in equipoise,</p>
<p>Realize the selflessness of conditioned phenomena,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“For those who accomplish the path of the pure eye</p>
<p>By realizing the characteristics of the limits</p>
<p>Of the exhaustion, arising, and cognition of the eye,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to receive this teaching.</p>
<p>“The same also applies to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“You should know that,</p>
<p>In the future,</p>
<p>All the countless monks will be</p>
<p>Either diligent or lazy in those ways.</p>
<p>“You should know that, in those ways,</p>
<p>They will either be virtuous or nonvirtuous friends,</p>
<p>Accomplished or unaccomplished,</p>
<p>Trusting or untrusting.</p>
<p>“You should know that, in those ways, they will be</p>
<p>Either virtuous or nonvirtuous friends</p>
<p>Who accomplish or do not accomplish</p>
<p>The path of the eye’s exhaustion.</p>
<p>“You should know that, in those ways,</p>
<p>Some will be strongly interested in awakening,</p>
<p>Only to lose interest later,</p>
<p>After one, two, or three months have passed.</p>
<p>“Still, even if the interest</p>
<p>Born upon hearing this teaching</p>
<p>Declines in some,</p>
<p>They will revive their faith later on.</p>
<p>“Some will not abandon their carelessness</p>
<p>When they hear this teaching;</p>
<p>Instead, they will think,</p>
<p>‘This discourse is not the Buddha’s words!’</p>
<p>“After hearing this teaching,</p>
<p>Some will be caught by Māra;</p>
<p>Even if faith has initially arisen in them,</p>
<p>They will abandon it later on.</p>
<p>“Those who are not interested in the Dharma will pursue falsehood, fame, and gain;</p>
<p>Although they might sing the praises of the lights</p>
<p>Of dhāraṇīs, absorption, and complete comprehension</p>
<p>As they roam through cities and towns, they will not gain true realization.</p>
<p>“Those who are bound by the five sense pleasures</p>
<p>And pursue worldly activities</p>
<p>Will involve themselves in concepts and statements,</p>
<p>And so denigrate the training in emptiness.</p>
<p>“Devoid of mindfulness and insight,</p>
<p>Their whole life will be wasted in meaningless pursuits;</p>
<p>The fools who abandon the Dharma of emptiness obstruct their discipline,</p>
<p>And so fall into the Hell of Unceasing Torment, never to be reborn in the higher realms.</p>
<p>“Someone who hears this discourse</p>
<p>And memorizes a single four-line verse from it</p>
<p>Is more exalted than someone who builds</p>
<p>A thousand stūpas in every single moment.</p>
<p>“Someone who hears this discourse</p>
<p>And memorizes a single four-line verse from it</p>
<p>Is more exalted than someone who offers</p>
<p>A hundred thousand flower garlands to the stūpas of the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Someone who contemplates this discourse</p>
<p>For just a single moment</p>
<p>Is more exalted than someone who builds</p>
<p>As many bejeweled stūpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>“Someone who contemplates this discourse</p>
<p>For just a single moment</p>
<p>Is more exalted than someone who venerates</p>
<p>Ten million buddha realms by tossing flowers.</p>
<p>“Someone who contemplates this discourse</p>
<p>For just a single moment</p>
<p>Is more exalted than someone who offers</p>
<p>Ten million Dharma robes to the buddhas.</p>
<p>“The buddha eye is pure and superior—</p>
<p>There is nothing that it does not know and see.</p>
<p>Those who are dedicated to this discourse</p>
<p>Will achieve the buddha eye.</p>
<p>“Countless eons ago,</p>
<p>The Buddha Dīpaṅkara appeared.</p>
<p>I was at that time the child of a brahmin,</p>
<p>And I worshiped him by holding up flowers.</p>
<p>“He prophesied that I would become a buddha</p>
<p>Named Śākyamuni,</p>
<p>And that I would teach this discourse</p>
<p>While sitting at the seat of awakening.</p>
<p>“You were a young boy at that time.</p>
<p>When you heard this prophecy,</p>
<p>You became overjoyed and filled with faith.</p>
<p>With your palms joined, you made this aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘When this brahmin child becomes a perfect buddha,</p>
<p>May I become his assistant.</p>
<p>After he passes into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>May I uphold and guard his collection of teachings!’</p>
<p>“When the Buddha Dīpaṅkara</p>
<p>Taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights,</p>
<p>Both the brahmin son and the young boy</p>
<p>Listened to it carefully and kept it in mind.</p>
<p>“In the past, I once offered blue lotus flowers to that buddha.</p>
<p>You were present at that time, and you made the aspiration</p>
<p>To uphold this discourse during the final period of my teachings</p>
<p>And to propagate it on a vast scale.</p>
<p>“Those who, upon hearing this teaching,</p>
<p>Do not give rise to aversion but hold it,</p>
<p>Keep it in mind, read it, and recite it</p>
<p>Are sublime beings!</p>
<p>“In the future, you should uphold</p>
<p>This teaching that is difficult to hear,</p>
<p>Teach it extensively, and reveal its meaning</p>
<p>To sentient beings!</p>
<p>“In the past,</p>
<p>When the true Dharma was about to disappear,</p>
<p>I also taught this discourse on the manifestation of lights</p>
<p>Extensively to sentient beings.</p>
<p>“Because fools do not accomplish it with determination,</p>
<p>They deprecate it.</p>
<p>Still, when I hear their words,</p>
<p>I do not become angry.</p>
<p>“Instead, I always cultivate patience</p>
<p>And benefit the world.</p>
<p>Since the strength of my patience is perfect,</p>
<p>I am adorned with the major and minor marks.</p>
<p>“Kumāra, you should regard the excellent</p>
<p>And perfect body of the Buddha,</p>
<p>As well as his pure and sublime golden color,</p>
<p>As the outcome of the strength of his patience.</p>
<p>“Countless realms shake</p>
<p>When my feet touch the earth,</p>
<p>Yet no sentient being loses balance;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my patience.</p>
<p>“The hundred thousand light rays</p>
<p>Emitted from each pore of my hair</p>
<p>Illuminate all directions;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Creatures with frightening appearances such as rākṣasas,</p>
<p>As well as ravishing and majestic beings,</p>
<p>All show reverence to me;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“All the members of my retinues</p>
<p>Have developed gentle minds,</p>
<p>And they revere the Thus-Gone One;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“All the praises of the Buddha’s qualities</p>
<p>Proclaimed within my great assemblies</p>
<p>With a hundred thousand musical tunes,</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“A hundred thousand malevolent</p>
<p>And frightening nāga kings</p>
<p>Become pleased when they see the Buddha;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Beings such as rākṣasas and yakṣas</p>
<p>Come to me carrying hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>Of flower garlands to worship me;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Thus-gone ones residing</p>
<p>In countless hundreds of thousands of realms</p>
<p>Are praising my qualities;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of mahoragas</p>
<p>And kaṭapūtanas gather together</p>
<p>And worship me by tossing flowers;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Sixty billion beings</p>
<p>Including the yakṣa kings</p>
<p>Come to worship me;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“The kings of the nāgas</p>
<p>Such as Manavaka</p>
<p>Also offer me red pearls;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Tumburu and a hundred thousand other devas of music</p>
<p>Gather together</p>
<p>And worship me with music;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of thousands of mahoragas</p>
<p>And kaṭapūtanas gather together</p>
<p>And worship me with offerings of flowers and perfumes;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“The nāga king Gandhāra</p>
<p>Reveals half of his body</p>
<p>And joins his palms respectfully toward me;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>

<p>Such as Anaṅga and Rāhula</p>
<p>Worship me with minds filled with faith;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Kumāra, you should see</p>
<p>That whoever is touched by the Buddha’s light rays</p>
<p>Becomes freed from suffering and obtains happiness;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Samudra and a hundred thousand</p>
<p>Gods of the wind fill the sky</p>
<p>And worship me by showering perfumed rains;</p>

<p>“You also advertise the Buddha’s miraculous power,</p>
<p>Generosity, and discipline,</p>
<p>Causing everyone to hear about them;</p>
<p>Regard this as the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Everyone gains understanding</p>
<p>Through the words related to the aggregates,</p>
<p>The elements, and the four truths;</p>
<p>All this is the outcome of the strength of my supreme patience.</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>
<p>The words related to the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>And utter peace, as well as the limit of its arising,</p>
<p>Are heard from the sky.</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>
<p>These words will be heard from the sky:</p>
<p>‘The eye arises from causes and conditions;</p>
<p>It does not come from or go anywhere.’</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>
<p>These words will be heard from the sky:</p>
<p>‘The buddhas are born from</p>
<p>The realization of the eye’s peace.’</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>
<p>These words will be heard from the sky:</p>
<p>‘Since the limit of the exhaustion of the eye is peace,</p>
<p>The buddhas are born from this realization.’</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>
<p>These words will be heard from the sky:</p>
<p>‘Since the limit of the eye is utter peace,</p>
<p>The buddhas are born from this realization.’</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous powers,</p>

<p>“The same applies to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words, names, and so forth.</p>
<p>“By extension, this explanation also applies</p>
<p>To desire, anger, ignorance,</p>
<p>Aggression, pretense, envy, deceit,</p>
<p>Arrogance, pride, and so forth.”</p>
<p>When he heard this unique and extraordinary teaching, Candraprabhakumārabhūta was overjoyed. With his palms joined, he said, “Blessed One, if I were to invite the Thus-Gone One and his large retinue for lunch tomorrow, would he consider me with affection and consent to come for the lunch that I will prepare?”</p>
<p>As he said this, the Blessed One perceived Kumāra’s pure motivation,  and he knew that this would benefit countless sentient beings. So, considering him with affection, he gave his consent by not responding. Candraprabhakumārabhūta then stood up, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, circumambulated him three times, and, filled with joy, went back to his home. Together with his retinue, and with the help of gods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, mahoragas, and other beings, he installed a silken marquee at a crossroads near the city of Rājagṛha. That marquee was very tall and wide, and it covered the whole area. It was decorated with symmetrical golden nets, garlands of precious gems, and lion standards, as well as a billion interwoven golden threads. Heaps of garlands of precious flowers in the most magnificent colors were spread on the floor, and innumerable garlands of other flowers, such as magnolia and rosewood flowers, were hung as ornaments, covering the entire interior of the precious marquee as well as the entire assembly. A throne and seats were arranged inside, and a variety of pure and delightful precious fragrant substances, such as pṛkkā, dumaca, sandalwood, and saffron, were burned. Different kinds of the most excellent mixed incenses were also prepared as offering substances. Fragrant water was sprinkled in all the lanes of the city, and fresh flowers were spread all over the ground. At that time, innumerable goddesses, female asuras, and daughters of Rāhula were thrilled and came with the desire to accomplish the cause of awakening, adorning that magnificent great city with their presence.</p>
<p>Once Candraprabhakumārabhūta knew that the entire city had been cleaned and decorated and it was time for the noon meal, he addressed the Blessed One,  “Blessed One, please come to this city in order to heal sentient beings!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived at the city with his many retinues, and as soon as he stepped through the city gate, the ground of that great city and countless billions of universes in the ten directions began to shake. At that moment, those who were blind could see, those who were suffering became happy, those who were deaf could hear, those who were ugly became handsome, those who were poor became wealthy, those who were childless had children, those who had no clothes received clothes, those who had no jewels received jewels, those who had no friends gained friends, and those who had no physical ornaments received all kinds of physical ornaments. Upon seeing the Thus-Gone One, many groups of birds such as swans, cranes, parrots, peacocks, and crows became overjoyed and started to sing the most pleasant and sublime songs, which brought immense delight to those who heard them.</p>
<p>Miraculously, the Thus-Gone One also emanated countless magnolia trees, and many hundreds of thousands of sentient beings worshiped the Blessed One by proffering fresh flowers as well as the most fragrant perfumes and strewing them upon him. Many hundreds of thousands of mighty female asuras carried red pearls and sandalwood powders, which they joyfully tossed at the Thus-Gone One. Many asuras and gods were also present in the sky, sheltering the Thus-Gone One by holding bejeweled parasols adorned with gold and silver above his head. Through his miraculous powers, the Blessed One manifested countless hundreds of thousands of sandalwood trees,  golden trees, and trees filled with jeweled vessels and cloths. Those trees were adorned with precious gems and with magnificent blooming flowers and leaves; they all manifested as the result of the collective karmic ripening of countless beings’ merit. Whenever the wind blew, the fragrance of their sublime perfumes pervaded innumerable buddha realms. Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings also held up flowers at the same time and tossed them upon the Blessed One. Similarly, countless insentient manifestations were also emanated solely through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers. Through his miraculous powers, all beings’ wishes were completely fulfilled in accordance with their individual aspirations.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One arrived in the city, the entire assembly heard extraordinary and inconceivable words of instruction that rang out in the sky, no one knowing where the words came from. In this way, Dharma teachings were uttered in many hundreds of thousands of verses.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who realize the limit of the exhaustion of desire to be empty and void</p>
<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>

<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who realize the cognition of desire to be empty and void</p>
<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who realize that desire is nonexistent, empty, and void</p>
<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who realize that desire is unborn, empty, and void</p>
<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who realize the complete cessation of desire to be empty and void</p>
<p>Will realize reality and achieve awakening.”</p>
<p>“The same also applies to anger, ignorance,</p>
<p>Aggression, pretense, miserliness,</p>
<p>Deceit, arrogance, pride, misery,</p>
<p>Suffering, origin, cessation, path,</p>
<p>“Sentient beings, boys, girls, women, men, living creatures,</p>
<p>The six faculties, the six objects, the four great elements,</p>
<p>The world, suffering, the aggregates, the elements,</p>
<p>Worldly arising, words, names, and so forth.”</p>
<p>Through those teachings of the Dharma lord,</p>
<p>All sentient beings were overjoyed,</p>
<p>And, upon hearing them, all the inhabitants of the divine worlds</p>
<p>Formed the wish to follow the vehicle of the Thus-Gone One.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was so dedicated to the strength of generosity,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of generosity.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was so dedicated to pure discipline,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of pure discipline.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure patience,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of that patience.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure diligence,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of that diligence.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure concentration,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of that concentration.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One entered the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Since the Blessed One was dedicated to pure insight,</p>
<p>He reached awakening through the strength of that insight.</p>
<p>“The same also applies to the strengths of miraculous powers,</p>
<p>The higher perceptions, the qualities, the knowledge of past lives,</p>
<p>Skill in means, retention, renown,</p>
<p>Faith in karma and in the branches of dependent origination, learning,</p>
<p>“Harmony with emptiness, peace, complete control,</p>
<p>Expertise in the ultimate limit and voidness, fear, delight, altruism,</p>
<p>Love, compassion, joy, equanimity, acceptance, harmlessness,</p>
<p>The realization of emptiness, the absence of marks, and so forth.”</p>
<p>When the noble master endowed with the ten powers—</p>
<p>The divine lord unmatched in terms of qualities and glory—</p>
<p>Came and walked in this sublime city,</p>
<p>He benefitted sentient beings extensively.</p>
<p>Since they had performed virtuous actions in the three realms in the past,</p>
<p>He caused the various virtues of the gods to increase.</p>
<p>All worldly beings revered him and listened to his teachings,</p>
<p>And everyone was filled with joy.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came and walked in this sublime city,</p>
<p>The vast ground of the city started to shake.</p>
<p>When they saw the completely pure lights emitted by the Blessed One,</p>
<p>Everyone was amazed and thrilled.</p>
<p>Since the Blessed One came to that city and benefitted beings extensively,</p>
<p>The retinues of gods and humans were delighted,</p>
<p>And beings residing on the earth and in the sky praised him by saying,</p>
<p>“The Blessed One brings the highest happiness to the three realms!”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One placed the wheels of his feet on the ground,</p>
<p>Pure light illuminated the place, amazing everyone.</p>
<p>The delightful sounds of thoroughbred horses resounded in the city,</p>
<p>And the birds flying in the sky were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Melodious tunes also manifested spontaneously</p>
<p>From the bracelets, anklets, necklaces,</p>
<p>And various other precious ornaments</p>
<p>Of the many faithful maidens, without anyone playing the ornaments.</p>
<p>Everyone conversed joyfully and complimented one another</p>
<p>With the most agreeable and auspicious words.</p>
<p>Those who were blind, deaf, or with other faculties impaired</p>
<p>Recovered the full ability of their senses.</p>
<p>When the Thus-Gone One came to the city,</p>
<p>Gods and humans joyfully offered him flowers,</p>
<p>And melodious tunes resounded everywhere in the sky,</p>
<p>Bringing delight to countless groups of gods.</p>
<p>Beings with impaired memory had their derangements pacified,</p>
<p>And they began to speak pleasantly to one another.</p>
<p>Pregnant women who were distressed and anxious</p>
<p>Were comforted by the magnificence of those lights.</p>
<p>Undefiled Dharma teachings were expounded</p>
<p>To the modest and humble men and women,</p>
<p>Causing all of them to joyfully give rise to a pure mindset</p>
<p>And to prostrate to the feet of the supreme lord.</p>
<p>Some of them pursued the unsurpassed path of the blessed ones,</p>
<p>And some pursued the path of the bodhisattvas or the path of the hearers.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the sublime city,</p>
<p>Everyone delighted in gazing at the face of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Knowing the customs of that land through his wisdom,</p>
<p>The Blessed One benefitted them in accordance with the ways of the world.</p>
<p>He bestowed the supreme wealth of the Dharma on the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>And gave supreme riches to other sentient beings.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Revere the Buddha.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who crave the limit of the arising of the eye</p>
<p>Revere the Buddha.</p>
<p>“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Will develop fearless trust in the Buddha;</p>

<p>“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Will achieve discipline free from clinging;</p>
<p>Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Their faith will be uninterrupted.</p>
<p>“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Will abandon desire that leads to the lower realms;</p>
<p>Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>

<p>Will dwell within awakened wisdom;</p>
<p>Since they perceive the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>The flow of their awakened wisdom will be uninterrupted.</p>
<p>“The same teaching concerning the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Also applies to all the gateways—the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, its cognition, its disengagement, its nonexistence,</p>
<p>Its unborn nature, its peace, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Those who crave the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Will always be free of doubts</p>
<p>And will therefore achieve</p>
<p>The Buddha’s miraculous powers.</p>

<p>Generate boundless wisdom;</p>
<p>Since wisdom is boundless,</p>
<p>So too is this Dharma teaching.</p>

<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand sentient beings</p>
<p>Heard those words of the Dharma manifested from the sky</p>
<p>And became free of doubts concerning the qualities of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Though desire arose in the minds of some of them,</p>
<p>They were not scared by the Buddha’s wisdom.</p>
<p>Though desire arose in the minds of some of them,</p>
<p>They did not turn away from the Buddha’s qualities.</p>
<p>Though desire arose in the minds of some of them,</p>
<p>They pursued unsurpassed wisdom.</p>
<p>They accomplished the unique qualities</p>
<p>And had no interest in the vehicle of the hearers.</p>
<p>Immature beings might practice concentration,</p>
<p>But since they are attracted to the bliss of concentration,</p>
<p>They will develop manifest pride</p>
<p>And think that they have achieved the fruition of virtuous practice.</p>
<p>Immature beings might practice concentration,</p>
<p>But since they do not understand the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will never reach liberation,</p>
<p>Even if they practice for a hundred thousand eons.</p>
<p>They generate attachment</p>
<p>To all forms of rebirth,</p>
<p>But if they were to understand the emptiness of birth itself,</p>
<p>Their vision would become completely pure.</p>
<p>Some might have accomplished the four concentrations,</p>
<p>But if they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Their concentration will never be pure,</p>
<p>Even after a hundred thousand eons.</p>
<p>Even if they have reached the preparatory absorptions,</p>
<p>They will not achieve an understanding of the limit of exhaustion,</p>
<p>And since they have not understood the attainment of exhaustion,</p>
<p>They will always experience defiled attainment.</p>
<p>Those who cling to perception</p>
<p>Lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of perception,</p>
<p>And since they have not understood the exhaustion of perception,</p>

<p>They will always experience a defiled world.</p>
<p>Those who abide by a defiled mind</p>
<p>Lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the mind,</p>
<p>And since they have not understood the exhaustion of the mind,</p>
<p>They will always experience defiled mind.</p>
<p>Those who dwell on defiled phenomena</p>
<p>Lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of phenomena,</p>
<p>And since they have not understood the exhaustion of phenomena,</p>
<p>They will always experience defiled phenomena.</p>
<p>Even if they abide by ascetic practices,</p>
<p>If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion</p>
<p>They will not observe genuine ascetic practices.</p>
<p>Even if they wear the saffron-colored robes,</p>
<p>If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>

<p>If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion</p>
<p>They will not belong to pure families.</p>
<p>Even if they possess numerous retinues,</p>
<p>If they lack the understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will quickly fall into the lower realms,</p>
<p>And their retinues will be unable to protect them.</p>
<p>Even if they are experts in grammar,</p>
<p>If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion</p>
<p>They will not fully grasp the field of grammar.</p>
<p>Even if they are experts in the sciences of craftsmanship,</p>
<p>If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Due to this lack of understanding of the eye’s exhaustion</p>
<p>They will not be truly competent in crafts.</p>
<p>Even if they are experts in many types of inquiries</p>
<p>And can reveal the teachings through a single word,</p>
<p>If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Their explanations will not accord with the true meaning.</p>
<p>Even if they learn under scholars,</p>
<p>If they do not know what is secret and what is not,</p>
<p>And if they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will not comprehend this teaching.</p>
<p>Even if they clearly know a variety of verbal expressions,</p>
<p>Worldly theories, and phenomena,</p>
<p>If they lack an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>It will be as if they have fallen into a thick creeping bush.</p>
<p>Even if they are experts in grammar who teach the signs of virtue and nonvirtue</p>
<p>And have mastered letters, words, language, reading, and recitation,</p>
<p>If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will lack an understanding of those topics.</p>
<p>Even if they are experts in female anatomy, in skillful words of seduction,</p>
<p>Pleasing and soothing their body, and applying various treatments,</p>
<p>If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will lack any real understanding of those skills.</p>
<p>Even if they can teach hundreds of scriptural traditions</p>
<p>Without forgetting a single letter,</p>
<p>If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Their explanations will be meaningless.</p>
<p>Know that the same applies</p>
<p>To the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, and its cognition,</p>
<p>Up to its utter peace.</p>
<p>The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>Even if they read and recite grammar</p>
<p>While understanding its meaning,</p>
<p>If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>

<p>Even if they recite the basis of authoritative speech</p>
<p>And understand secret mantras,</p>
<p>If they have not understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Their knowledge will always be inferior.</p>
<p>Know that the same applies</p>
<p>To the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, and its cognition,</p>
<p>Up to its utter peace.</p>
<p>The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>

<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>Countless sentient beings</p>
<p>Heard those Dharma words manifested from the sky</p>
<p>And gained an understanding of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city, countless sentient beings</p>
<p>Heard those Dharma words manifested from the sky</p>
<p>And realized the intrinsic nature of the eye.</p>
<p>Realizing emptiness and selflessness, they all achieved the pure eye.</p>
<p>The same should be applied to everything</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>Know that the same also applies</p>
<p>To desire, ignorance, aggression,</p>
<p>Pride, arrogance, and deceit,</p>
<p>Up to carelessness.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>

<p>Upon hearing those names, everyone achieved the pure eye.</p>
<p>Everything can be measured—including the vastness of the sky,</p>
<p>The depths of the ocean, and the size of Mount Sumeru—</p>
<p>But the wisdom of the Buddha cannot be fathomed.</p>
<p>For those who have gained certainty about the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>It will not be difficult to achieve the Dharma body,</p>
<p>And those who have achieved the supreme Dharma body</p>
<p>Will attain the boundless, all-apprehending wisdom.</p>

<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, textures, and mental phenomena,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>At that moment, the great earth with its ocean and mountains started to shake,</p>
<p>And all the many asuras and gods became euphoric.</p>
<p>Everyone aspired to defeat the deceitful Māra and his armies,</p>
<p>And to achieve the state of buddhahood.</p>
<p>Residing in their respective palaces,</p>
<p>The gods joyfully exclaimed to one another,</p>

<p>And benefitted all the gods and humans!”</p>

<p>He has defeated many demons and non-Buddhists;</p>
<p>He has perfected unsurpassed awakening</p>
<p>And guided many beings to the other shore!”</p>
<p>When they heard this, all the gods of the Brahmā realms</p>
<p>Were delighted, and intense faith arose in their minds.</p>
<p>With magnificent melodious voices, they praised Buddha</p>
<p>And said, “The Great Guide has come and benefitted the world!”</p>
<p>When they heard those words passing from one group to another,</p>
<p>The gods of the Heaven of Brahmā’s Retinue joyfully exclaimed,</p>
<p>“The Great Guide has come and benefitted the worlds!</p>
<p>He scares away and frightens the armies of Māra!”</p>
<p>Everyone up to the gods of the Peak of Existence heard those words:</p>
<p>“The Buddha has come and benefitted the world!”</p>
<p>As those words resounded everywhere,</p>
<p>The asuras decreased and the gods increased in number.</p>
<p>The houses of the demons became empty,</p>
<p>While the retinues of gods multiplied.</p>
<p>Through the power of fearlessness, all beings overcame their wrong views</p>
<p>And swiftly reached supreme awakening.</p>
<p>The very moment the gods heard those words,</p>

<p>And manifests many forms;</p>
<p>All these are the Buddha’s miraculous powers.</p>
<p>He gave different teachings</p>
<p>To those who were suitable vessels and those who were not:</p>

<p>Those limitless tunes manifested</p>
<p>Through the Blessed One’s miraculous powers.</p>
<p>Since those miraculous powers were endless,</p>
<p>The teachings, too, were endless.</p>
<p>At times, through the power of those miraculous displays,</p>
<p>The bodies of buddhas turning the Dharma wheel—</p>
<p>Just as the one seen today—</p>
<p>Were manifested in realms devoid of a buddha.</p>

<p>They did not come from or go anywhere—</p>
<p>They were beyond directions.</p>
<p>The same should be applied to everything</p>
<p>Up to forms and the mind.</p>
<p>Still, due to their ignorance,</p>
<p>Immature beings will entertain doubts about this.</p>
<p>Since the beautiful words</p>
<p>Manifesting from those various ornaments</p>
<p>Resounded in all the buddha realms,</p>
<p>Countless sentient beings were liberated.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should regard as pure</p>
<p>The Guide’s body and mind—</p>
<p>His self-manifest wisdom</p>
<p>And his body endowed with boundless qualities.</p>
<p>He has transcended craving’s proliferation,</p>
<p>He is disengaged and faultless,</p>
<p>His mind is purified and free from views,</p>
<p>And he is adorned with the major and minor marks.</p>
<p>You see how when the Blessed One</p>
<p>Came to the city,</p>
<p>He walked like a lion,</p>
<p>He moved like a swan and like an elephant,</p>
<p>He fulfilled the wishes of all sentient beings,</p>
<p>He had perfected the most exalted form of merit,</p>
<p>He was adorned with the authentic marks,</p>
<p>And all beings gazed at him insatiably.</p>
<p>You see how since the supreme leader of human beings</p>
<p>Was endowed with great compassion,</p>
<p>The smallest gift offered to him</p>
<p>Caused one to gain immeasurable benefits;</p>
<p>For many hundreds of thousands of eons,</p>
<p>Until the attainment of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The karmic ripening of those many sentient beings</p>
<p>Was therefore uninterrupted.</p>
<p>You see how the perfect leader of human beings</p>
<p>Had perfected undefiled discipline,</p>
<p>Causing many sentient beings</p>
<p>To respectfully prostrate to him,</p>
<p>And how numerous divine retinues</p>
<p>Abandoned their palaces</p>
<p>And attended to the Guide,</p>
<p>Without any attachment to playful activities.</p>
<p>You see how Māra and his hordes</p>
<p>Developed faith in the Blessed One,</p>
<p>Brought forth golden fans,</p>
<p>And arranged them around him.</p>
<p>Five hundred māras</p>
<p>Tossed magnificent divine flowers</p>
<p>Onto the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>And pursued unsurpassed wisdom.</p>
<p>Since they had praised and worshiped</p>
<p>Buddhas in the past,</p>
<p>Each of them now became delighted</p>
<p>Upon meeting the Blessed One;</p>
<p>They proclaimed the praises of the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>With countless eloquent words.</p>
<p>At that time, those māras</p>
<p>Were said to have abandoned cyclic existence.</p>
<p>As soon as they proclaimed the praises of the Blessed One,</p>
<p>They understood the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>And the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Up to the characteristics of its utter peace.</p>
<p>Since they had realized the boundless meanings of the eye—</p>
<p>The eye’s exhaustion and so forth—</p>
<p>They taught them to sentient beings</p>
<p>With skillful words.</p>
<p>Since they did not cling to names and meanings</p>
<p>And had no doubts about them,</p>
<p>They realized that they do not come from or go anywhere,</p>
<p>And that they are beyond adoption and rejection.</p>
<p>Since the nature of words is empty and void,</p>
<p>They realized that words are beyond</p>
<p>Abandonment, adoption, retention,</p>
<p>Reading, recitation, and accomplishment.</p>
<p>This has also been revealed</p>
<p>By the thus-gone ones of the past;</p>
<p>Since they are mere imputations,</p>
<p>They are ultimately inexpressible.</p>
<p>Such intrinsically empty phenomena</p>
<p>Transcend the aggregates, the elements, and the sense sources;</p>
<p>They are neither false nor true, but groundless and unsupported;</p>
<p>They eliminate verbal expressions and bring thoughts to utter peace.</p>
<p>Since immature beings are attached to the marks of beings,</p>
<p>They see the Blessed One coming to the city;</p>
<p>Although the Blessed One is completely beyond marks,</p>
<p>Those immature beings entertain mistaken thoughts.</p>
<p>Those who become delighted</p>
<p>When the Blessed One comes to the city</p>
<p>Conceive of marks</p>
<p>And will be tormented.</p>
<p>Those who have transcended conceptual marks</p>
<p>Will not see him coming to the city;</p>
<p>They will reach the insight that is free</p>
<p>From all concepts related to the marks of going and moving.</p>
<p>Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks</p>
<p>See him coming to the city;</p>
<p>They generate concepts</p>
<p>Related to birth and saṃsāric phenomena.</p>
<p>Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks</p>
<p>And become delighted</p>
<p>Are dwelling within Māra’s domain;</p>
<p>Those are the manifestations of Māra’s domain.</p>
<p>Those who perceive the Buddha in terms of marks</p>
<p>See him as changing;</p>
<p>Since they are tormented,</p>
<p>They are the objects of a wise person’s pity.</p>
<p>Those who view the Dharma as something to be attained</p>
<p>Must also worry that the Dharma will be lost.</p>
<p>Those who perceive the Buddha as taking birth</p>
<p>Experience the suffering of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Those who have understood all marks</p>
<p>By training for many eons</p>
<p>Do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,</p>
<p>And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Those who realize that the characteristics of the mind are empty</p>
<p>Are dwelling within the domain of the buddhas;</p>
<p>They do not conceive of the Buddha coming to the city,</p>
<p>And they do not entertain the notion of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Those who clearly understand in that way</p>
<p>Will behold the buddhas</p>
<p>But realize that their essence is empty;</p>
<p>In the end, they completely transcend birth and cessation.</p>
<p>After practicing austerities for countless eons, the Blessed One</p>
<p>Has realized the empty essence, but immature beings do not understand this.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>He was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of retinues.</p>
<p>Compared to the merit created by humans and nonhumans</p>
<p>Who make offerings with minds filled with faith,</p>
<p>The merit created by someone who, for a single instant,</p>
<p>Contemplates the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>And realizes the emptiness of its marks</p>
<p>Is more exalted;</p>
<p>No number, fraction, or illustration</p>
<p>Comes close to that merit.</p>
<p>Know that the same applies</p>
<p>To the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, and its cognition,</p>
<p>Up to its utter peace.</p>
<p>The same should also be applied to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, and textures,</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Blessed One</p>
<p>Came to the city,</p>
<p>The earth started to shake</p>
<p>By the mere fact of his feet touching the ground.</p>
<p>All the mountains</p>
<p>Bowed toward the Blessed One,</p>
<p>And all the gods and humans came to listen to the Dharma</p>
<p>And worshiped him with reverence.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>The lords of the gods, the kings of the humans,</p>
<p>Many asuras, and many yakṣas left their cities,</p>
<p>Gathered in front of the Blessed One, and joyfully worshiped him.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>All the countless types of birds—</p>
<p>Parrots, peacocks, and kalaviṅka birds—</p>
<p>Started to play joyfully in the sky.</p>
<p>When they saw the supreme qualities</p>
<p>Of the Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One,</p>
<p>They all started to sing</p>
<p>Various melodious tunes.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>Through his miraculous powers</p>
<p>All those—among the countless hundreds of thousands of beings present—</p>
<p>Who were blind regained sight,</p>
<p>All those who were deaf could hear,</p>
<p>All those with impaired faculties</p>
<p>Recovered the full functioning of their faculties,</p>
<p>And all those who were suffering became happy.</p>
<p>At that time, when the Blessed One</p>
<p>Came to the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded</p>
<p>In the sky:</p>
<p>“Those who conceive of the Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>In terms of marks cannot be said to worship the Blessed One,</p>
<p>And they do not realize</p>
<p>The nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>“Those who abandon marks gather the basis of all qualities,</p>
<p>And so they realize the nature of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>Since they will realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will also comprehend the buddhas’ qualities.</p>
<p>“With no grasping and obscuration regarding the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>With no maintaining and dwelling on the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>And free of thinking regarding the disengagement of the eye,</p>
<p>One truly sees the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Those who are free of thoughts regarding the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Who are free of mental concepts regarding the limit of the eye,</p>
<p>And who do not express anything regarding the eye’s disintegration</p>
<p>Truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Those who are free of attachment regarding the nonexistence of the eye,</p>
<p>Free of grasping regarding the eye’s unborn nature,</p>
<p>And free of clinging regarding the eye’s utter peace</p>
<p>Truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Since they understand the eye’s exhaustion, they actualize the marks.</p>
<p>Since they understand the limit of the eye, they ascertain the faculties.</p>
<p>Since they understand the eye’s arising, they reach mastery over their faculties.</p>
<p>Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Having realized the nonexistence of the eye, they comprehend forms.</p>
<p>Having realized the eye’s disintegration, they discern phenomena.</p>
<p>Having realized the eye’s unborn nature, they accomplish the path.</p>
<p>Those beings truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Since they genuinely realize the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They also understand the different types of actions,</p>
<p>And since they understand the different types of actions,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Since they genuinely realize the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>They also understand the different types of suffering,</p>

<p>They also realize the disintegration of suffering,</p>
<p>And since they realize the disintegration of suffering,</p>

<p>“Since they genuinely realize the nonexistence of the eye,</p>
<p>They also realize the abandonment of characteristics,</p>
<p>And since they realize the abandonment of characteristics,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Since they genuinely realize the unborn nature of the eye,</p>
<p>They also realize the abandonment of latent patterns,</p>
<p>And since they realize the abandonment of latent patterns,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize the nonconceptual nature of the eye,</p>
<p>They also realize the abandonment of obscurations,</p>
<p>And since they realize the abandonment of obscurations,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize that the eye is beyond words,</p>
<p>They also realize the strength of awakened wisdom,</p>
<p>And since they realize the strength of awakened wisdom,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize that the eye does not come from anywhere,</p>
<p>They also realize the abandonment of desires,</p>
<p>And since they realize the abandonment of desires,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, since they genuinely realize the practice of concentration,</p>
<p>They also realize the abandonment of afflictions,</p>
<p>And since they realize the abandonment of afflictions,</p>
<p>They truly see the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Similarly, those persons also perfect</p>
<p>The knowledge of the eye’s past limit,</p>
<p>The knowledge of the eye’s lack of abiding,</p>
<p>The knowledge of the eye’s arising,</p>
<p>“The knowledge of the Buddha’s miraculous powers,</p>

<p>And the knowledge that does not involve engagement—</p>
<p>“And, likewise, knowledge of marks and the absence of marks,</p>

<p>“They cause many sentient beings</p>
<p>To achieve pure wisdom,</p>
<p>Powerful wisdom,</p>
<p>And diligent wisdom.</p>

<p>And show no interest in the Dharma,</p>
<p>They are able to inspire them.</p>
<p>“Since they genuinely realize</p>
<p>The ways things are,</p>

<p>“The same should be applied</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>

<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“Those who contemplate the fact</p>
<p>That the causes and conditions of the eye</p>
<p>Are ultimately empty, void, and devoid of self</p>
<p>Will, accordingly, perfect genuine mental absorption without a doubt.</p>
<p>“The persons who realize with certainty and contemplate</p>
<p>The eye’s dependent origination and impermanent character</p>
<p>Will, accordingly, genuinely realize</p>
<p>That the causes and conditions of the eye are ultimately nonexistent.</p>
<p>“The same should be applied</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names.”</p>
<p>Here, I have summarized the amazing displays that were manifested,</p>
<p>By the mere fact of his feet touching the ground,</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city.</p>
<p>To please beings, I will now teach a bit about his qualities.</p>
<p>At that moment, countless hundreds of thousands of light rays</p>
<p>Radiated from each pore of the guide of gods and humans.</p>
<p>Each of those light rays illuminated countless realms</p>
<p>And performed awakened activity for the sake of numerous beings.</p>
<p>If those who have worshiped buddhas in the past</p>
<p>And practiced generosity and discipline for a long time</p>
<p>Hear about the miraculous displays that were described,</p>
<p>They will be overjoyed and filled with devotion.</p>
<p>If those persons who know that the Buddha’s miraculous powers</p>
<p>Are not the domain of the hearers and the solitary buddhas</p>
<p>Hear about the miraculous displays that were described,</p>
<p>They will be filled with devotion and amazement.</p>
<p>Since the guide of gods and humans manifested</p>
<p>Such a variety of miraculous displays through his inconceivable powers,</p>
<p>Countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings</p>
<p>Attended to, revered, and worshiped the Thus-Gone One.</p>
<p>Since the leader of gods and humans expounded</p>
<p>Countless hundreds of thousands of discourses through his inconceivable powers,</p>
<p>Many sentient beings, upon hearing them,</p>
<p>Faithfully adopted all those teachings and were overjoyed.</p>
<p>At that time,</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>These words resounded in the sky</p>
<p>Through the strength of his miraculous powers:</p>
<p>“By knowing the limit of the exhaustion of the eye</p>
<p>Up to its peace and its causes,</p>
<p>Everything is beyond coming and going—</p>
<p>Ultimately empty and void.</p>
<p>“The same should be applied</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names.”</p>
<p>At that time,</p>
<p>When the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>The most sublime melodious voice</p>
<p>Manifested in the sky,</p>
<p>Proclaiming the praises</p>
<p>Of the Thus-Gone One’s various names,</p>
<p>Thereby generating faith and devotion</p>
<p>In the minds of all the members of those great assemblies:</p>

<p>Will teach others the meaning of the absence of arising and cessation.</p>
<p>“The lion of human beings who resides now in the world</p>
<p>Is named Dharma Lord Endowed with Pure Vision;</p>
<p>Those who keep that name in mind</p>
<p>Will teach others the meaning of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye.</p>
<p>“The same should be applied to all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names,</p>
<p>As well as to flower garlands, perfumes, lamps, parasols, and fabrics.”</p>
<p>At that time, when the Blessed One came to the city,</p>
<p>Through his inconceivable miraculous powers,</p>
<p>The most sublime melodious voice</p>
<p>Manifested in the sky.</p>
<p>As it revealed the various</p>
<p>Activities of the dhāraṇīs,</p>
<p>The great assemblies present</p>
<p>Heard these words:</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs cause one to realize all the ultimate modes of phenomena—</p>
<p>From the limit of the exhaustion of the eye, the limit of its arising,</p>
<p>Its limit, its disengagement, and its cognition, up to its peace.</p>
<p>They cause one to realize that, ultimately, everything is pure—</p>
<p>“That which is gathered through the power of generosity,</p>
<p>That which is accomplished through the power of discipline,</p>
<p>That which is established through the power of patience,</p>
<p>That which is generated through the power of diligence,</p>
<p>“That which is cultivated through the power of concentration,</p>
<p>And that which is revealed through the power of insight,</p>
<p>As well as the abandonment of words, expressions,</p>
<p>And language, up to forms and mind.</p>
<p>“They cause one to realize that everything defiled and undefiled,</p>
<p>As well as all welfare and benefit,</p>
<p>Is empty, void,</p>
<p>And ultimately pure.</p>
<p>“They do not cause one to abide or dwell</p>
<p>In any of the realms of existence;</p>
<p>Instead, they cause one to abide, disengaged,</p>
<p>In dhāraṇī and absorption.</p>
<p>“Everything is beyond coming and going—</p>
<p>Not virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral.</p>
<p>All marks, such as those that benefit</p>
<p>Oneself and others, are pure.</p>
<p>“Therefore, they cause one not to dwell</p>
<p>On the qualities of a supreme being</p>
<p>Or the qualities of the hearers,</p>
<p>Ordinary beings, or the buddhas.</p>
<p>“They pacify all the acts related to</p>
<p>The limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>The limit of its arising, and its limit,</p>
<p>Up to its peace.</p>
<p>“They cause one to abandon</p>
<p>All arising, non-arising,</p>
<p>Suffering, happiness,</p>
<p>Praise, and criticism.</p>
<p>“Both the realization of all these perfect manifestations</p>
<p>And these empty dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Cause one to dwell within</p>
<p>The domain of the buddhas;</p>
<p>“They place one firmly within the abode of the buddhas’ display,</p>
<p>Within the buddhas’ miraculous powers,</p>
<p>And within the buddhas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>They also cause one to dwell within the power</p>
<p>“Of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>Within the power of the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>And within the power of the limit of the eye,</p>
<p>Up to the power of its peace.</p>
<p>“The same applies</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs cause one to perfect</p>
<p>The exalted power of the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>Once these dhāraṇīs have caused one to perfect such a magnificent power,</p>
<p>One will enter the abodes of all the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“By dwelling in the domain of all the thus-gone ones,</p>
<p>One will cause all worldly beings,</p>
<p>Such as the hosts of asuras,</p>
<p>To abandon their rigid clinging and observe pure conduct.</p>
<p>“One will delight all the countless hundreds of thousands of yakṣas</p>
<p>And all the countless kumbhāṇḍas;</p>
<p>One will also tame and delight all the innumerable</p>
<p>Retinues of gandharvas and rākṣasas.</p>
<p>“Even if the retinues of Brahmā</p>
<p>Attempted to utter their words and express their meaning</p>
<p>With sublime melodious voices,</p>
<p>They would not be able to reveal them.</p>
<p>“They cannot be fathomed</p>
<p>Through any mental states;</p>
<p>They cannot be grasped</p>
<p>Through any mental states.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs cannot be apprehended</p>
<p>By the eyes, or by anything up to the body;</p>
<p>They cannot be apprehended</p>
<p>By the eyes, or by anything up to the domain of the eyes.</p>
<p>“The same applies</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names.</p>
<p>“They cause one to understand all marks—</p>
<p>The fact that the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>The limit of its arising, its limit, and its cognition,</p>
<p>Up to its peace,</p>
<p>“Are devoid of self, being,</p>
<p>Mind, life principle,</p>
<p>Person, marks, action,</p>
<p>Going, coming, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, they cause one to realize</p>
<p>The eye of reality,</p>
<p>The eye accomplished on the basis of Dharma teachings,</p>
<p>The eye of wisdom, the eye of insight,</p>
<p>“The eye of Brahmā, the divine eye,</p>
<p>The eye achieved by being born in the Brahmā realms,</p>
<p>The eye achieved by being born in the god realms,</p>
<p>The eye of the karmic ripening of Brahmā,</p>
<p>“The eye of the karmic ripening of the gods,</p>
<p>The eye arising from the causes of Brahmā,</p>
<p>The eye arising from the causes of the gods,</p>
<p>The eye of divine miraculous powers,</p>
<p>“The eye of divine diligence,</p>
<p>The eye of inferior births,</p>
<p>The eye of noble births,</p>
<p>The eye that relinquishes the world of the lord of death,</p>
<p>“The eye of the nāgas, the yakṣas, and the kumbhāṇḍas,</p>
<p>The eye associated with torment,</p>
<p>The eye free of torment,</p>
<p>The pure eye, the impure eye,</p>
<p>“The broad eye and the narrow eye,</p>
<p>The eye of the hearer’s vehicle,</p>
<p>The eye of concentration,</p>
<p>The eye of absorption,</p>
<p>“The eye arising from experience,</p>
<p>The eye arising from perception,</p>
<p>The eye arising from desire,</p>
<p>The eye free from desire,</p>
<p>“The eye arising from causes,</p>
<p>The eye arising from non-causes,</p>
<p>The concurrent eye,</p>
<p>The nonconcurrent eye,</p>
<p>“The eye arising based on the gateways,</p>
<p>The eye not arising from the gateways,</p>
<p>The eye arising from causes and conditions,</p>
<p>The eye arising from the gateway of the cause,</p>
<p>“The eye not made of flesh,</p>
<p>The eye of pure wisdom,</p>
<p>The eye of nonexistence,</p>
<p>And the eye of nonapprehending.</p>
<p>“The same applies</p>
<p>To all the twenty-five phenomena—</p>
<p>From the ear, the nose, the tongue, and the body</p>
<p>Up to words and names.”</p>
<p>At that moment, through the Thus-Gone One’s miraculous powers,</p>
<p>The Blessed One manifested in the sky</p>
<p>The most sublime, boundless, and melodious voices,</p>
<p>Which proclaimed this exalted dhāraṇī Dharma:</p>
<p>Sile male male siddhe aini siṅe kulu niyu kulu neyu kule male kunote alaśi asile sisilete susile sile sile khyivile avile suṭecana dhani mani kani kalate sukale praya śanaṅni anulosikye bilome subhanireśhe aśirile saramaparaphunte paribhahe dharani dheśuciha sudhe acana bhuvogaganaṅ kudpano bhasabhanaṅ panridhuriya niparikanoni manaṃbha suruciṭa pana-ācara abhelaviryapratiṣṭha ha dharini asiṭa loṅibhi.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs have been obtained by the buddhas.</p>
<p>Their great powers are complete, and their insights are infinite;</p>
<p>They cause one to abandon clinging,</p>
<p>And they purify recollection.</p>
<p>“They are formless, beyond coming and going,</p>
<p>Beyond all cardinal and intermediate directions,</p>
<p>Devoid of marks, inexpressible,</p>
<p>And beyond concepts.</p>
<p>“If bodhisattvas accomplish them, they will eventually attain coolness.</p>
<p>Even if each of their words were explained</p>
<p>Through hundreds of billions of verses,</p>
<p>Their scope could never be apprehended.</p>
<p>“They are praised by many noble beings,</p>
<p>And highly revered</p>
<p>By all the numerous assemblies</p>
<p>That are pure and free from clinging.</p>
<p>“Through the power of the virtue</p>
<p>Created by these dhāraṇīs,</p>
<p>Afflictions are completely overcome and pacified,</p>
<p>And the most excellent benefits are gained.</p>
<p>“They lead to qualities and insight as great as a vast ocean,</p>
<p>They cause one to achieve acceptance,</p>
<p>And they cause the mind to be at ease and unshakable.</p>
<p>They are always cultivated by the bodhisattvas and praised by the wise.</p>
<p>“They liberate from poverty and provide wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>These dhāraṇīs increase qualities</p>
<p>And cause one to be constantly adorned</p>
<p>By words of truth, such as emptiness.</p>
<p>“Since they go beyond words,</p>
<p>They are known as empty essence.</p>
<p>Since they go beyond mind and consciousness,</p>
<p>They are known as essence of phenomena.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs always lead to stainlessness and purity.</p>
<p>Being grounded in genuine wisdom,</p>
<p>They reveal many benefits</p>
<p>And generate joy and faith in many sentient beings.</p>
<p>“They bring great delight</p>
<p>To the countless retinues of yakṣas,</p>
<p>The retinues of kumbhāṇḍas,</p>
<p>And also the rulers of the starving spirits.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇī mantras</p>
<p>Are utterly peaceful and beyond concepts.</p>
<p>They cause happiness to manifest for all beings</p>
<p>Out of love for them.</p>
<p>“Though they constantly remain within the realms of beings</p>
<p>For hundreds of thousands of eons,</p>
<p>Bringing infinite benefits,</p>
<p>They remain immaculate and unsullied.</p>
<p>“They bring great joy</p>
<p>To countless sentient beings</p>
<p>By revealing the ambrosia-like Dharma</p>
<p>Through hundreds of thousands of verses.</p>
<p>“The countless buddhas of the past</p>
<p>Relied on these dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>With the purest trust</p>
<p>And so perpetually realize reality.</p>
<p>“When they hear these dhāraṇīs,</p>
<p>The minds of Brahmā, Śakra, the gods,</p>
<p>The kings of the nāgas, and the asuras</p>
<p>Become filled with joy.</p>
<p>“The lands where these dhāraṇī mantras are found</p>
<p>Remain perpetually free from harm,</p>
<p>Turmoil, diseases,</p>
<p>Suffering, and misery.</p>
<p>“With minds filled with joy,</p>
<p>All sentient beings make the aspiration</p>
<p>That these dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Constantly remain within their minds.</p>
<p>“If these dhāraṇī mantras</p>
<p>Always remain connected to the body, the mind,</p>
<p>The palate, the mouth, and the lips,</p>
<p>Boundless qualities will be generated.</p>
<p>“If they are held constantly,</p>
<p>Countless qualities will be achieved,</p>
<p>Many sentient beings will benefit,</p>
<p>And everyone will experience joy.</p>
<p>“Since these dhāraṇī mantras</p>
<p>Cause one to abandon negative deeds</p>
<p>And reveal the sacred Dharma,</p>
<p>Infinite eloquence will be achieved.</p>
<p>“The doubts of hundreds of thousands of sentient beings</p>
<p>Will be cleared away,</p>
<p>Pride will be overcome,</p>
<p>And boundless qualities will be achieved.</p>
<p>“The wise always contemplate</p>
<p>And persistently accomplish</p>
<p>These dhāraṇī mantras—</p>
<p>These utterly profound and secret teachings.</p>
<p>“Donning the armor of insight,</p>
<p>They completely overcome the afflictions</p>
<p>And develop the qualities of their minds</p>
<p>With great dedication and without feeling weary.</p>
<p>“These glorious and excellent</p>
<p>Dhāraṇī mantras</p>
<p>Cause beings to realize the limits</p>
<p>Of exhaustion, non-exhaustion, arising, and non-arising.</p>
<p>“Since they are adorned</p>
<p>With those various insights,</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of thus-gone ones</p>
<p>Revere and worship them.</p>
<p>“These dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Produce the two feet of knowledge,</p>
<p>Place one firmly within the supreme absorption,</p>
<p>And cause one to follow the path to awakening;</p>
<p>“They cause one to pursue tranquility and insight</p>
<p>And to realize undefiled insight.</p>
<p>Through the strength of the faculty of deep faith,</p>
<p>They perfect the two hands.</p>
<p>“They cause one to achieve the two breasts</p>
<p>Through diligence and patience,</p>
<p>And to achieve the characteristics of the crown of the head</p>
<p>Through the perfection of insight.</p>
<p>“By making a thread with those discourses</p>
<p>And using it for the garland of the four individual knowledges,</p>
<p>One will be adorned with all the various unequaled qualities</p>
<p>That were accomplished in the past.</p>
<p>“Since these dhāraṇī mantras</p>
<p>Are endowed with countless excellent qualities,</p>
<p>One will realize all the gateways,</p>
<p>Such as the past and future limits of the eye,</p>
<p>“The limits of its exhaustion and non-exhaustion,</p>
<p>Its arising and non-arising,</p>
<p>Its limit and non-limit,</p>
<p>Its engagement and disengagement,</p>
<p>“Its cognition and noncognition,</p>
<p>Its complete nonexistence, its absence of origination,</p>
<p>Its quiescence, its absence of self, its absence of person,</p>
<p>Its absence of life principle, and its absence of sentient being.</p>
<p>“The same applies to the ear, the nose,</p>
<p>The tongue, the body, the mind,</p>
<p>The six sense objects, and the four great elements,</p>
<p>Up to the names produced in the world.</p>
<p>“The sublime and sacred dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>That were praised earlier</p>
<p>Are endowed with the qualities of complete disengagement,</p>
<p>And they belong to the domain of the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the true meaning of these dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Cannot be expressed in words.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to accord with worldly beings,</p>
<p>They have been expressed here with imputed words.”</p>
<p>Then, together with his numerous retinues, the Blessed One arrived at the house of Candraprabhakumāra and sat down on the throne that had been prepared for him. When he saw the Blessed One sitting on the throne, Candraprabhakumārabhūta brought the most sublime offering articles and offered them to the Thus-Gone One and his great assemblies. That offering was entirely accomplished through his inconceivable power and the roots of virtue generated by his extraordinary concentration, absorption, and concentration qualities. Since he made that offering not only for himself but in order for all the countless sentient beings to strive for awakening and achieve great benefits, that act of worship was all-pervasive and satisfied everyone.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had finished his lunch, he said these words to Candraprabhakumārabhūta in front of the numerous retinues: “Kumāra, if noble sons or daughters who follow the Great Vehicle accomplish the accumulation of generosity, they will be endowed with eighty types of eminent qualities. What are those eighty? (1) They will ripen sentient beings and attract them with pleasant words. (2) They will perfect the excellent marks.  (3) All their faculties will be complete. (4) They will abandon saṃsāra and actualize nirvāṇa. (5) Their afflictions will be exhausted and they will achieve supreme might. (6) They will be adorned with perfect qualities and buddha realms. (7) Their retinues will be pure. (8) They will be endowed with great majesty. (9) They will be endowed with perfect insight. (10) They will accomplish the most eminent activities. (11) They will perfect unequaled and unsurpassed conduct. (12) They will overcome all latent patterns and develop the omniscient conduct of the thus-gone ones. (13) Their bodies and relics will be worshiped by all worldly beings, hearers, and solitary buddhas. (14) They will tame malevolent beings and therefore generate faith in the rulers of humans, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, and gods of the Brahmā realms. (15) They will have great power. (16) They will adopt, keep in mind, and teach the sūtras, the verses, the prophecies, the aphorisms, the hymns and praises, the biographies, the narratives, the former events, the former births, the extensive teachings, the marvels, and the profound doctrines. (17) They will not succumb to laziness. (18) They will be free of miserliness with respect to the Dharma. (19) They will genuinely follow the path of the buddhas. (20) They will be the most eminent beings within the worlds, and their names and appearances will be completely pure. (21) They will actualize the Dharma body. (22) They will achieve fearlessness. (23) They will be endowed with excellent merit. (24) They will outshine non-Buddhists. (25) They will possess the perfect qualities of sublime beings. (26) They will renounce negative forms of conduct. (27) They will have complete trust in the causes of merit and wisdom.  (28) They will gather the qualities of the buddhas. (29) They will subjugate many demons. (30) They will have no doubts or hesitations about the true teachings of the Buddha. (31) They will overcome unwholesome desires. (32) They will be endowed with great majesty. (33) They will accomplish the bodhisattva conduct and therefore achieve the extraordinary miraculous powers. (34) They will transcend birth and death. (35) They will ripen sentient beings. (36) They will proclaim the praises of boundless conduct. (37) They will develop all excellent qualities. (38) They will generate enthusiasm in sentient beings. (39) They will experience the joy of Dharma. (40) They will accomplish generosity. (41) They will enter the gateway of great wisdom. (42) They will abide in the foremost Dharma. (43) They will belong to the definitive family. (44) They will achieve the acceptance of phenomena. (45) They will easily follow the path of the buddhas. Kumāra, if noble sons or daughters accomplish the accumulation of generosity, they will be endowed with and perfect those eighty types of eminent qualities.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“I have briefly described here</p>
<p>The eighty supreme benefits</p>
<p>Achieved by the wise bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who are endowed with the accumulation of generosity.</p>
<p>“I will now teach a little bit</p>
<p>About all the qualities,</p>
<p>Boundless and hard-to-conceive,</p>
<p>That arise on the basis of generosity.</p>
<p>“Those accumulations of generosity</p>
<p>That you have offered with an impartial mind</p>
<p>In the presence of these numerous assemblies</p>
<p>Should be accomplished by all the wise ones.</p>
<p>“The mass of merit accumulated</p>
<p>Through these acts of generosity is inconceivable;</p>
<p>It will cause you to perfect</p>
<p>All the physical adornments of the major and minor marks.</p>
<p>“All your birthplaces, your family lines,</p>
<p>Your lands, your households,</p>
<p>Your renown, your bodies, and your minds</p>
<p>Will be pure.</p>
<p>“All the divine miraculous displays,</p>
<p>The palaces, the goddesses,</p>
<p>And the pure, unimpeded eloquence</p>
<p>Originate from generosity.</p>
<p>“The buddhas praise</p>
<p>The supreme accumulation of generosity</p>
<p>By proclaiming that it is</p>
<p>The foremost foundation of awakening.</p>
<p>“Diligent bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who have no doubt about generosity</p>
<p>Accomplish it persistently</p>
<p>And with full conviction.</p>
<p>“If bodhisattvas perfect</p>
<p>The accumulation of merit</p>
<p>With a generous mindset,</p>
<p>They will achieve the awakening of the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Since they perfect the supreme miraculous powers</p>
<p>Through the strength of generosity,</p>
<p>Even if they cause ten million realms to shake,</p>
<p>Sentient beings will not be harmed.</p>
<p>“The power of the practice of generosity</p>
<p>Induces pure discipline, erudition,</p>
<p>Genuine trust, diligence,</p>
<p>Absorption, and undefiled insight.</p>
<p>“The power of the practice of generosity</p>
<p>Induces the powers, the strengths, the authentic path,</p>
<p>The exertions, the bases of miraculous power,</p>
<p>And the abandonment of latent patterns.</p>
<p>“The power of the practice of generosity</p>
<p>Causes the boundless Dharma</p>
<p>To be taught in billions of realms</p>
<p>Through pure and melodious voices.</p>
<p>“By practicing generosity with sincere faith,</p>
<p>One will swiftly achieve the miraculous powers;</p>
<p>In order to perfect those miraculous powers,</p>
<p>One should therefore practice generosity persistently.</p>
<p>“If rulers—like those who play freely</p>
<p>In their sublime palaces</p>
<p>While surrounded by retinues</p>
<p>Of countless gods and many hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>“Of asuras, nāgas, and yakṣas—</p>
<p>See beings who exert themselves in the practice of generosity,</p>
<p>They will all stand up, welcome them,</p>
<p>Lay out seats for them, and worship them.</p>
<p>“Since the persons who practice generosity</p>
<p>Are endowed with perfect great majesty</p>
<p>And have gained mastery over the miraculous powers,</p>
<p>They will attract the kings of the gods.</p>
<p>“All the kumbhāṇḍas and the yakṣas</p>
<p>Will go to them for refuge,</p>
<p>And the gandharvas and their retinues</p>
<p>Will worship them by playing music.</p>
<p>“All bandits will become kind,</p>
<p>All hostile beings will leave for faraway places,</p>
<p>One’s wealth will never decline,</p>
<p>And the storerooms will always be full.</p>
<p>“By practicing generosity,</p>
<p>The supreme accumulations will be perfected,</p>
<p>And, until awakened wisdom is achieved,</p>
<p>They will not engage in the practices of non-Buddhists.</p>
<p>“One will never fall sick,</p>
<p>And one will be protected by the dhāraṇīs.</p>
<p>Even the extraordinary strengths</p>
<p>Will originate from generosity.</p>
<p>“In that way, those who practice generosity</p>
<p>Will accomplish the path of awakening;</p>
<p>They will never meet nonvirtuous friends</p>
<p>But will gain friends with conducive behaviors.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, since bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who gather the accumulation of generosity</p>
<p>Will perfect the inconceivable dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>And insight,</p>
<p>“They will reveal thorough comprehension</p>
<p>Through countless verses.</p>
<p>Since they will be unimpeded in all respects,</p>
<p>They will not lose the essential meaning.</p>
<p>“They will be firmly dedicated</p>
<p>To the vast attitude set on awakening,</p>
<p>Their discipline will be pure and perfect,</p>
<p>And they will overcome the activities of Māra.</p>
<p>“They will not cling to the five sense pleasures</p>
<p>But will pursue recollection one-pointedly.</p>
<p>Since their minds are constantly free of delusion,</p>
<p>They will not crave sense pleasures.</p>
<p>“They will genuinely understand</p>
<p>The affliction of anger,</p>
<p>And they will be free of clinging and delusion</p>
<p>With respect to all the domains of experience.</p>
<p>“Those persons will properly understand</p>
<p>All afflictions as well as everything else—</p>
<p>From the defects that arise</p>
<p>From the gathering of causes and conditions,</p>
<p>Up to the causes</p>
<p>Of the qualities of the buddhas,</p>
<p>The causes of their causes,</p>
<p>And the effects of those causes.</p>
<p>“Since they will clearly understand</p>
<p>The causes of the limit of the exhaustion of the eye,</p>
<p>They will completely abandon delusion</p>
<p>And will not cling to the eye.</p>
<p>“Since they will also clearly understand</p>
<p>The causes of the limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, its disengagement,</p>
<p>Its cognition, its nonexistence,</p>
<p>“And its unborn nature,</p>
<p>Up to its quiescence and so forth,</p>
<p>They will completely abandon delusion</p>
<p>And will not cling to the eye.</p>
<p>“They will realize that the expression past limit of the eye</p>
<p>Is a mere imputation</p>
<p>That accords with the world’s conventions,</p>
<p>And that it is therefore, ultimately, completely nonexistent.</p>
<p>“They will also realize that the expressions</p>
<p>The limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition,</p>
<p>Its complete nonexistence, and its unborn nature,</p>
<p>“Up to its peace,</p>
<p>Are all mere imputations</p>
<p>That accord with the world’s conventions,</p>
<p>And that therefore they, too, are ultimately nonexistent.</p>
<p>“Since they will realize that the expression</p>
<p>Past limit of the eye</p>
<p>Arises from the gathering of causes and conditions,</p>
<p>They will not cling to it at all.</p>
<p>“Since they will realize that the expression</p>
<p>Future limit of the eye</p>
<p>Arises from the gathering of causes and conditions,</p>
<p>They will not cling to it at all.</p>
<p>“Since they will realize that the expressions</p>
<p>The limit of the arising of the eye,</p>
<p>Its limit, its disengagement, its cognition,</p>
<p>Its complete nonexistence, and its unborn nature,</p>
<p>“Up to its peace,</p>
<p>Arise from the gathering</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Those who do not understand</p>
<p>The limit of the arising of the eye and the limit of its exhaustion</p>
<p>Are deluded with respect to thorough comprehension;</p>
<p>The wise should therefore stay away from them.</p>

<p>“Likewise, since the essential nature of dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Cannot be expressed in words,</p>
<p>It is devoid of sides</p>
<p>And will not be reached by the mind.</p>
<p>“That Dharma is beyond joy</p>

<p>Do not truly exist;</p>
<p>Since the self is intrinsically empty,</p>
<p>Thorough comprehension is also nonexistent.</p>
<p>“Thorough comprehension is intrinsically empty,</p>

<p>And thorough comprehension are empty;</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, those two thoughts themselves</p>
<p>Are also completely beyond apprehension.</p>
