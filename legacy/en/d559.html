<h1>The Queen of Incantations</h1>
</header>
<p>The Great Peahen</p>
<p>I pay homage to all past, future, and present buddhas, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas!</p>
<p>I pay homage to the Buddha! I pay homage to the Dharma! I pay homage to the Saṅgha!</p>
<p>I pay homage to the seven completely perfect buddhas, together with their saṅgha of śrāvakas! I pay homage to the arhats in the world! I pay homage to all bodhisattvas, led by Maitreya! I pay homage to the non-returners! I pay homage to the once-returners! I pay homage to the stream enterers! I pay homage to those in the world who have gone correctly! I pay homage to those who have progressed correctly! Having paid homage to them, I will now recite the great peahen, the queen of incantations.</p>
<p>May this incantation be successful for me! Assemblies of bhūtas, whether coursing on earth, in the sky, or in water, gods, nāgas, asuras, maruts, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, pretas, piśācas, bhūtas, kumbhaṇḍas, pūtanas, kaṭapūtanas, skandas, unmādas, chāyās, apasmāras, and ostārakas—listen to me!</p>
<p>Assemblies of bhūtas who sap vitality, devour wombs, drink blood, and devour fat, flesh, grease, marrow,  and offspring! You who sap life force and devour oblations, flower garlands, perfumes, incense, flowers, fruits, grains, and burnt offerings! You who devour pus and feces, drink urine, devour leftovers, saliva, phlegm, snot, filth, and vomit, and drink from cesspools! All you with evil, wicked, and violent intentions, who steal the life force of others—listen to me! I will recite the great peahen, the queen of incantations! I will also give you perfume, flowers, incense, and oblations!</p>
<p>All you grahas with evil, wicked, and violent intentions toward me, who steal the life force of others and devour their vitality—depart!</p>
<p>All you with gentle, loving, and virtuous intentions—listen to me! All you with devotion the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha—listen to me!</p>
<p>It is like this: “Kālī, Karālī, Kumbhāṇḍī, Śaṅkhinī, Kamalākṣī, Hārītī, Harikeśī, Śrīmatī, Haripiṅgalī, Lambā, Pralambā, Kālapāśā, Kalaśodarī, Yamadūtī, Yamarākṣasī, and Bhūtagrasanī! Accept these flowers, incense, perfumes, and oblations that I will offer you! Protect me from all perils and misfortunes!  May I live a hundred years! May I see a hundred autumns! May the words of the incantation be fulfilled for me! Svāhā!”</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Jetavana at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove in Śrāvastī. At that time, there was also a tender, young, a monk named Svāti staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove of Jetavana in Śrāvastī. It had not been long since he had set forth, was ordained, and entered the teachings and monastic discipline. While he was gathering wood for the saṅgha’s steam bath–house, a large black snake emerged from the hollow of a rotten log and bit him on the big toe of his right foot. His body went weak, and he collapsed onto the ground. He lay there with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Venerable Ānanda saw the monk Svāti lying there collapsed on the ground, afflicted, suffering, and extremely ill, with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Witnessing this, he rushed to the Blessed One, bowed at his feet, and stood to one side.</p>
<p>Standing to one side, Venerable Ānanda asked, “Venerable Blessed One! Here at Jetavana, at Anāthapiṇḍada’s grove in Śrāvastī, there is a tender, young monk named Svāti. It has not been long since he set forth, was ordained, and entered the teachings and monastic discipline. He was gathering wood for the saṅgha’s steam bath–house when a large black snake emerged from the hollow of a rotten log and bit him on the big toe of his right foot. His body went weak, he collapsed to the ground and curled up, and he is lying there with his eyes rolled back, vomiting foam. Venerable Blessed One! How should I treat him?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda! Go and make use of the Thus-Gone One’s speech! Use the great peahen, queen of incantations, to protect the monk Svāti against gods, grahas, nāga grahas, asura grahas, marut grahas, garuḍa grahas, gandharva grahas, kinnara grahas, mahoraga grahas, yakṣa grahas, rākṣasa grahas, preta grahas, piśāca grahas, bhūta grahas, kumbhaṇḍa grahas, pūtana grahas, kaṭapūtana grahas, skanda grahas, unmāda grahas, chāyā grahas, apasmāra grahas, ostāraka grahas, nakṣatra grahas, kṛtyā rites, kākhordas, kiraṇas, vetālas, ciccakas, preṣakas, indigestible food, evil vomit, wicked chāyās, the evil eye, written hexes, traversed hexes, neglected spirits, one-day fevers, two-day fevers, three-day fevers, four-day fevers, weeklong fevers, half-month fevers, month-long fevers, daily fevers, momentary fevers, chronic fevers, intermittent fevers, fevers from bhūtas, fevers from humans, fevers from nonhumans, and fevers that arise from wind disorders, bile disorders, phlegm disorders, or their combination, as well as all other fevers! Use this incantation to guard him! Conceal him! Protect him! Care for him! Nurture him! Bring about his tranquility and well-being! Keep away punishments and weapons! Counteract the poison! Neutralize the poison! Draw a boundary! Bind the earth! Remove headaches! Remove splitting headaches! Remove loss of appetite, eye illness, nose illness, mouth illness, throat illness,  heart disease, sore throat, earache, toothache, heart pain, side pain, backache, stomachache, cheek pain, urinary tract pain, male genital pain, female genital pain, hip pain, thigh pain, calf pain, hand pain, foot pain, and pain in the major and minor appendages! May all buddhas grant me well-being in the night, well-being in the day, well-being at midday, and well-being day and night!</p>

<p>“Long ago, Ānanda, there was a peacock king named Suvarṇāvabhāsa who lived on the southern slope of Himavat, a king of mountains. In the morning he secured his health and good fortune through the great peahen, queen of incantations, and lived happily during the day. In the evening he used it to secure his health and good fortune, and he lived happily during the night.</p>
<p>“Homage to the Buddha!</p>
<p>Homage to the Dharma!</p>
<p>Homage to the Saṅgha!</p>
<p>Homage to the great peahen, queen of incantations!</p>
<p>Tadyathā hu hu hu hu hu hu nāga le le le dumba le le le nāga le le le huya huya vija vija thusu thusu gulu gulu hu cejini cejini agulu elā melā elā melā tilī melā ili mitte ile tili mitte dumbe sudumbe tosu tosu golā velā capalā vimalā iṭṭiri bhiṭṭiri riṭṭiri namo buddhānāṃ cilikisi godohikānāṃ namo arhatāṃ hāla hāla.</p>
<p>“May the god shower down rain everywhere! Homage to the buddhas! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Once, Suvarṇāvabhāsa did not secure his protection and good fortune through the great peahen, queen of incantations, and became transfixed by pleasures. Intoxicated with lust, he was stupefied and became as though unconscious. Thus completely agitated, he wandered from garden to garden, park to park, and mountain slope to mountain slope with numerous young forest peahens until he unwittingly entered a mountain fissure. There, some low caste youths, pernicious foes who had been seeking an opportunity to harm him for a long time, captured him with a peacock snare. Amid these enemies he regained his memory and brought to mind the great peahen, queen of incantations.</p>
<p>“Homage to the Buddha!</p>
<p>Homage to the Dharma!</p>
<p>Homage to the Saṅgha!</p>
<p>Homage to the great peahen, queen of incantations!</p>
<p>Tadyathā hu hu hu hu hu nāga le le le dumba le le le nāga le le le huya huya huya vija vija thusu thusu gulu gulu hu cejini cejini agulu ilā melā ili melā tili melā ili mitte ili tili mitte dumbe sudumbe tosu tosu golā velā capalā vimalā iṭṭiri bhiṭṭiri riṭṭiri namo buddhānāṃ cilikisi godohikānāṃ namo arhatāṃ hāla hāla.</p>
<p>“May the god shower rain down everywhere! Homage to the buddhas! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Then, delivered from that torment, he successfully and safely returned to his own land, where he also chanted the following secret mantra syllables:</p>
<p>“Homage to the Buddha!</p>
<p>Homage to the Dharma!</p>
<p>Homage to the Saṅgha!</p>
<p>Homage to Suvarṇāvabhāsa, king of peacocks!</p>
<p>Homage to the great peahen, queen of incantations!</p>

<p>“Homage to all buddhas! May I have well-being and be protected! May I live a hundred years! May I see a hundred autumns!</p>
<p>Tadyathā huci śuci ghuci muci svāhā!</p>
<p>“Ānanda, you may think that the peacock king named Suvarṇāvabhāsa was someone else at that time. It should not be seen that way. Why is that? Well, Ānanda, at that time, I myself was the peacock king named Suvarṇāvabhāsa. Ānanda, I, too, will now recite the essence mantra of the great peahen, queen of incantations.</p>
<p>Tadyathā ili mitte tili mitte tili mili mitte tili mili mili tili tili mitte vili mili mitti vili mili mitti vili mili mili tili mili sudumbā dumbā suvaca cirikisiya bhinna miṭi namo buddhānāṃ cilikisi prāntamūle itihārā lohitamūle dumbā sudumbā kuṭṭi kuṇaṭṭi kukunaṭṭi tili kuñja nāṭṭi.</p>
<p>“May the god in Aḍakavatī shower down rain for nine or ten months!</p>
<p>Ili mili kili mili kili mili ketumūle dudumbe sudumoḍe dalimi sanduvaṭṭe busavaṭṭe vusara vusara dhanavastrake narkalā narkalime khalima ghoṣe rakhile iti sajjale dumbe sudumbe aṭṭe naṭṭe pranaṭṭe anaṇaṭṭe anamāle.</p>
<p>“May the god Indra shower down fresh water everywhere!</p>
<p>Nārāyaṇi pārāyaṇi haritāli kuntāli kubhaṇṭi ili misti kili misti kili tili misti.</p>
<p>“May the syllables of this Dravidian mantra be fulfilled! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Ānanda, this was the essence of the great peahen, queen of incantations. Ānanda, this great peahen, queen of incantations, should be brought to mind when dwelling in a town. It should also be brought to mind when dwelling in the wilderness, when traveling, when lost,  when in the king’s court, when among bandits, when on fire, when submerged in water, when among enemies, when among opponents, when among those who are hostile, when in an assembly, when in a dispute, when bitten by a snake, after drinking poison, and when all perils converge. It should also be brought to mind when one is struck and afflicted by any illness from among the 404 types, including wind disorders, bile disorders, phlegm disorders, and their combination. Why is that? Well, Ānanda, even a criminal deserving execution gets off with only a severe punishment. A criminal deserving severe punishment gets off with only a beating. A criminal deserving a beating gets off with a scolding. A criminal deserving a scolding gets off with a warning. A criminal deserving a warning gets off with only having his body hairs bristle with fear. And a criminal deserving of having his body hairs bristle with fear will likewise be released. All his illnesses will be cured. Ānanda, these incantations and secret mantra syllables should also be brought to mind:</p>
<p>Tadyathā cili mili kili mili ketumūle vusavaṭṭe vusariṇe vudariṇi kevaṭṭe kevaṭṭeka mūle iti śavale dumba vetumbe priyaṅkare āvaṭṭe parivarṭṭe.</p>
<p>“May the god shower a rain of fresh water everywhere!</p>
<p>Namo bhagavate iṭṭittāya indragomisikāya bhṛṅgarikāya āśane pāśane pāpanikūle kapilamitte ili mitte.</p>
<p>“Homage to the Blessed Buddha! May the secret mantra syllables be fulfilled! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Ānanda, may this great peahen, the queen of incantations taught by the Thus-Gone One, protect me! May it guard me, care for me, nurture me, bring about my tranquility and well-being, keep away punishments and weapons, counteract poison, neutralize poison, draw a boundary, and bind the earth! May I live a hundred years! May I see a hundred autumns!</p>
<p>“Ānanda, nowhere in the worlds of gods, māras, Brahmā, humans who are śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas, and asuras have I seen any god, goddess, divine son, divine daughter, male divine elder, female divine elder, male divine attendant, female divine attendant, male nāga, female nāga, nāga son, nāga daughter, male nāga elder, female nāga elder, male nāga attendant, female nāga attendant, male asura, female asura, asura son, asura daughter, male asura elder, female asura elder, male asura attendant, female asura attendant, male marut, female marut, marut son, marut daughter, male marut elder, female marut elder, male marut attendant, female marut attendant, male garuḍa, female garuḍa, garuḍa son, garuḍa daughter, male garuḍa elder, female garuḍa elder, male garuḍa attendant, female garuḍa attendant, male gandharva, female gandharva, gandharva son, gandharva daughter, male gandharva elder, female gandharva elder, male gandharva attendant, female gandharva attendant, male kinnara, female kinnara, kinnara son, kinnara daughter, male kinnara elder, female kinnara elder, male kinnara attendant, female kinnara attendant, male mahoraga, female mahoraga, mahoraga son, mahoraga daughter, male mahoraga elder, female mahoraga elder, male mahoraga attendant, female mahoraga attendant, male yakṣa, female yakṣa, yakṣa son, yakṣa daughter, male yakṣa elder, female yakṣa elder, male yakṣa attendant, female yakṣa attendant, male rākṣasa, female rākṣasa, rākṣasa son, rākṣasa daughter, male rākṣasa elder, female rākṣasa elder, male rākṣasa attendant, female rākṣasa attendant, male preta, female preta, preta son,  preta daughter, male preta elder, female preta elder, male preta attendant, female preta attendant, male piśāca, female piśāca, piśāca son, piśāca daughter, male piśāca elder, female piśāca elder, male piśāca attendant, female piśāca attendant, male bhūta, female bhūta, bhūta son, bhūta daughter, male bhūta elder, female bhūta elder, male bhūta attendant, female bhūta attendant, male kumbhaṇḍa, female kumbhaṇḍa, kumbhaṇḍa son, kumbhaṇḍa daughter, male kumbhaṇḍa elder, female kumbhaṇḍa elder, male kumbhaṇḍa attendant, female kumbhaṇḍa attendant, male pūtana, female pūtana, pūtana son, pūtana daughter, male pūtana elder, female pūtana elder, male pūtana attendant, female pūtana attendant, male kaṭapūtana, female kaṭapūtana, kaṭapūtana son, kaṭapūtana daughter, male kaṭapūtana elder, female kaṭapūtana elder, male kaṭapūtana attendant, female kaṭapūtana attendant, male skanda, female skanda, skanda son, skanda daughter, male skanda elder, female skanda elder, male skanda attendant, female skanda attendant, male unmāda, female unmāda, unmāda son, unmāda daughter, male unmāda elder, female unmāda elder, male unmāda attendant, female unmāda attendant, male chāyā, female chāyā, chāyā son, chāyā daughter, male chāyā elder, female chāyā elder, male chāyā attendant, female chāyā attendant, male apasmāra, female apasmāra, apasmāra son, apasmāra daughter, male apasmāra elder, female apasmāra elder, male apasmāra attendant, female apasmāra attendant, male ostāraka, female ostāraka, ostāraka son, ostāraka daughter, male ostāraka elder, female ostāraka elder, male ostāraka attendant, or female ostāraka attendant  who intends to harm anyone who, with the use of the great peahen, queen of incantations, is guarded, concealed, protected, cared for, and nurtured, whose tranquility and well-being is secured, who is kept safe from punishments and weapons, whose poison is counteracted, whose poison is stopped, around whom a boundary is drawn, or who has bound the earth.</p>
<p>“Even if one of them, wishing to find a point of entry, were to search for one, it would not be found. Gods would not find a place to assemble. Nāgas would not find a place to assemble.

<p>I have brought about well-being!</p>
<p>“Ānanda,  poison is neutralized by the great peahen, queen of incantations! May the monk Svāti be well!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One. Obeying the Blessed One, he bowed to his feet, circumambulated him three times, and approached the monk Svāti. Using the great peahen, queen of incantations, Ānanda delivered the monk Svāti from harm. He guarded him, cared for him, protected him, brought about his tranquility and well-being, kept away punishments and weapons, counteracted the poison, neutralized the poison, drew a boundary, and bound the earth! Once Venerable Ānanda had thus saved him and brought about his well-being, the venerable monk Svāti was healed of his affliction.</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda and the venerable monk Svāti approached the Blessed One and bowed to his feet. They told the Blessed One exactly what happened. The Blessed One approved, and they sat to one side.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, have you witnessed the power of the great peahen, queen of incantations?”</p>
<p>Ānanda, bowing in response to what the Blessed One had uttered, said, “How, O Blessed One, could this not be perceived?”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “it is possible for the four great oceans to dry up. It is possible for the earth to rise into the sky. It is possible for the moon and the sun to fall to earth. It is even possible for rivers to reverse their flow. But it is impossible for the statements of the Thus-Gone One to be anything other!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to Venerable Ānanda, “Therefore, Ānanda,  you are to inspire devotion to the great peahen, queen of incantations, among the fourfold retinue of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” replied Venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Obeying the Blessed One, he inspired the fourfold retinue of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen to have devotion to the great peahen, queen of incantations.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had thus spoken, Venerable Ānanda, Venerable Svāti, and all the gods, asuras, maruts, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, humans, and nonhumans who were present in the entourage rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
