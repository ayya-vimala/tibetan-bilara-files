They will become dear to and delight all grahas, vighnas, and vināyakas. They will recall their rebirths of the past eight trillion four hundred million eons. Eighty-four billion vidyā deities of the vajra family will always and perpetually guard, protect, and defend them. The eighty-four vajra dūtīs and kiṅkaras will always defend them, hold them to be dear, and delight in them. They will never become yakṣas, rākṣasas,  bhūtas, pretas, piśācas, pūtanas, or kaṭapūtanas, nor will they ever be poor. They will gain a quantity of merit equal to that of the blessed buddhas, who are as innumerable and limitless as grains of sand in the river Ganges.</p>
<p>“If one keeps this invincible queen of spells for averting named Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas, one will become chaste if one was not chaste.  Those who did not observe silence will observe silence. The impure will become pure. Those who did not practice abstinence will practice abstinence. Even those who committed the five acts with immediate retribution will see their evil entirely purified. All the obscurations resulting from their past actions will be exhausted without exception.</p>
<p>“If a woman who wishes to have a child keeps this invincible queen of spells for averting named Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas, she will gain a child. The child will have a long life and possess merit and strength. After they pass away, they will take birth in Sukhāvatī, where they will be free of desire, aversion, delusion, pride, and vanity.</p>
<p>“Those who are threatened by diseases that affect humans, cattle, or livestock or by epidemics, calamities, infectious diseases, mental disturbances, and the approach of opposing armies should affix this invincible queen of spells for averting named the blessed, undefeated, perfectly awakened Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas to the top of a banner and worship it extensively with great offerings.  The banner should then be planted at the gateway to any city or at a monastery, village, city, realm, market town, charnel ground, mountain, or wilderness residence. As soon as this invincible queen of spells for averting has been worshiped and planted, war will be pacified, as will calamities, violence, harm, epidemics, mental disturbances, and the approach of opposing armies. Ananta, Śaṅkhapāla,  Mahākṛṣṇa, Nanda and Upananda, and all the other nāga kings will send timely rain, lightning, and peals of thunder. All illness and calamities will be completely pacified.</p>

<p>“When facing any calamity this should be recited three times in connection with the Buddha.”</p>
<p>After the Blessed One spoke these words, all buddhas and the bodhisattvas, together with the world of devas humans, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thus concludes the noble invincible great queen of spells for averting called “Sitātapatrā Born from the Uṣṇīṣa of All Tathāgatas.”</p>
