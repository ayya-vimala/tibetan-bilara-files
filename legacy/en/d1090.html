<h1>Praising the Lady Who Rules Disease</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to Glorious Vajrapāṇi.</p>
<p>O Devī, you wander in this world, naked, riding a donkey;</p>
<p>Anointed with sesame oil, your hair a single plait, and with lead earrings, you are seductive and fully adorned,</p>
<p>While iron shackles grace your feet as anklets.</p>
<p>We know your nature is beautiful, and yet who can know the matter of your great ocean of activity for others? |1|</p>
<p>In saṃsāra, at the time of destruction, when from human bodies blood and fat ooze forth, and smoke rises,</p>
<p>O Devī, in a single instant you will toss all beings into your terrifying, fanged mouth.</p>
<p>O Kālī, you who hold a human skull, as the domain of yogic practice you take delight in cremation grounds,</p>
<p>And the terrifying ringing of your bell subdues the wicked ones and dispels and quells all ills and mortal perils. |2|</p>
<p>Adorned with a crown of warriors’ heads, you bear a garland of heads severed on the battlefield.</p>
<p>You dance with your supple arms opened wide, wearing a nāga lord as a belt across your broad hips.</p>
<p>Intoxicated by the liquor of blood, in your hands you brandish a spear and sword.</p>
<p>Your eyes bloodshot, you are seen by the host of bhūtas who wander cremation grounds at night. |3|</p>
<p>You wear a great torn hide and a half-open shawl, bound with a belt of braided straw.</p>
<p>With your moon-like face adorned with strings of fresh human entrails, you ring a bell at your cheek.</p>
<p>Your body freshly oiled and painted in patches with drops of blood, fat, and the like,</p>
<p>You tear at human flesh with your glistening teeth. O Kāpālikā, protect me! |4|</p>
<p>Fiercest among fierce ladies, terrifying, with human flesh in your mouth, the first time they saw you</p>
<p>Even the mātṛkās were frightened and terrified as you flew into a rage, your bloodshot eyes flickering about‍—I bow to you!</p>
<p>Beautiful Kālī, your black body is so overwhelming that even Śakra and the rest are compelled</p>
<p>To praise you daily, and even I, Yama, will always bow trembling before you. |5|</p>
<p>You who bring an end to humans and all living beings,</p>
<p>On one side, by your ear, is an uraga, whose thousand-headed hood is spread and adorns you.</p>
<p>At the other ear you keep a supreme lion, as you trample the entire ocean-encircled earth.</p>
<p>The sun that crosses the sky, brilliant with a thousand rays, rests directly at your navel. |6|</p>
<p>You are the fire that blazes forth from the expanse of the ocean,</p>
<p>Able to dry up the whole of the sea.</p>
<p>Because all women are pacified,</p>
<p>You are present as half of Mahādeva’s body. |7|</p>
<p>Durgā, Umā, Mahākālī,</p>
<p>To whom gods and asuras pay homage—</p>
<p>You who know all plagues,</p>
<p>Render them harmless!</p>
<p>Yama’s Sister, Wife of the Demon,</p>
<p>Sovereign Goddess of the Desire Realm‍—I praise you! |8|</p>
<p>This concludes “Eight Verses Praising Śrīdevī Mahākālī, the Lady Who Rules All Disease,” composed by the brahmin Vararuci.</p>
