<h1>The Aspiration Prayer from “Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm”</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to the Three Jewels!</p>
<p>In this world or beyond there is nothing—</p>
<p>Not even a precious gem in the higher realms—</p>
<p>That equals the Thus-Gone One, the god of gods,</p>
<p>The supreme among humans.</p>
<p>Thus, he is called the most precious gem.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>There is nothing at all comparable to the Dharma</p>
<p>Of uncompounded, quiescent ambrosia—</p>
<p>The uncompounded ambrosia of extinction and dispassion</p>
<p>Discerned by the Sage of the Śākyas through his knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus, it is called the most precious gem.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>There is nothing comparable to the absorption</p>
<p>That perceives the vajra-like, nondual path—</p>
<p>The manifestation, in due order, of what is most desired,</p>
<p>The permanent accomplishment of the teacher’s absolute practice.</p>
<p>Thus, it is called the most precious gem.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>The eight great kinds of person praised</p>
<p>And called the four pairs,</p>
<p>Extolled as “venerable” by the Thus-Gone One,</p>
<p>The incomparable person, the Great Sage,</p>
<p>Yield great fruits when offered to,</p>
<p>Like seeds planted in a fertile field—</p>
<p>This is called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>Since those who strive with firm resolve</p>
<p>And enter Gautama’s teaching</p>
<p>Gain access to ambrosia,</p>
<p>Remove darkness, and attain nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>They are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>As soon as they connect with this vision,</p>
<p>Belief in the transitory collection,</p>
<p>Ethical discipline in the form of extreme austerity,</p>
<p>And doubt are simultaneously cast off,</p>
<p>And they see the truths of the noble ones.</p>
<p>Thus, they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>With body, speech, or mind</p>
<p>They never produce the threefold evil deeds,</p>
<p>And even when they suddenly do, they do not conceal them,</p>
<p>And in that way, their view is not tainted with grasping.</p>
<p>Thus, they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>Just as a threshold beam planted in the ground</p>
<p>Is unmoved by winds from the four directions,</p>
<p>So are the members of the saṅgha of noble ones,</p>
<p>Who have insight into the highest path of the noble ones.</p>
<p>Thus, they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>Those who cultivate with profound wisdom</p>
<p>The eloquently taught truths of the noble ones</p>
<p>And consider giving away even their own bodies</p>
<p>Never encounter the eight perils.</p>
<p>Thus, they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>Just as a flame extinguished by the wind</p>
<p>Cannot be taken up and counted,</p>
<p>So do the offspring of the buddhas</p>
<p>Become indemonstrable</p>
<p>Once they have discarded all fetters.</p>
<p>Thus, they are called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>By this truth may there be well-being here!</p>
<p>May all sentient beings, moving or still, be well here!</p>
<p>And may they pay homage to the Buddha,</p>
<p>The supreme teacher, venerated by gods and humans!</p>
<p>May there be well-being here today!</p>
<p>May all sentient beings, moving or still, be well here!</p>
<p>May they pay homage to the Dharma,</p>
<p>The peaceful dispassion venerated by gods and humans!</p>
<p>May there be well-being here today!</p>
<p>May all sentient beings, moving or still, be well here!</p>
<p>May they pay homage to the Saṅgha,</p>
<p>The supreme assembly venerated by gods and humans!</p>
<p>May there be well-being here today!</p>
<p>May all sentient beings, moving or still,</p>
<p>Be well here!</p>
<p>May whatever bhūtas are assembled here,</p>
<p>All those who dwell upon the earth or in the sky,</p>
<p>Act always lovingly toward all creatures</p>
<p>And practice Dharma day and night!</p>
<p>By the truth that the Victorious One, having vanquished his foes,</p>
<p>Spoke truthfully, without falsehood,</p>
<p>May there be well-being here,</p>
<p>And may all be delivered from grave perils!</p>
<p>✦  ✦  ✦</p>
<p>By the majesty of all the buddhas,</p>
<p>The majesty of the pratyekabuddhas,</p>
<p>The powers of the arhats,</p>
<p>And all the secret mantra holders,</p>
<p>By the wisdom of Śāriputra,</p>
<p>The supernatural power of Maudgalyāyana,</p>
<p>The vision of Aniruddha,</p>
<p>And the ascetic practices of Kāśyapa;</p>
<p>By the previous attainments of Kauṇḍinya,</p>
<p>The learning of Ānanda,</p>
<p>The benevolence of Brahmā,</p>
<p>And the supremacy of Śatakratu;</p>
<p>By the territories of the guardians of the world,</p>
<p>The power of Maheśvara,</p>
<p>The might of the generals,</p>
<p>And the supernatural splendor of Hārītī—</p>
<p>Through their might and majesty,</p>
<p>May poison be removed from me!</p>
<p>This completes the aspiration prayer from the words spoken in “Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm.”</p>
