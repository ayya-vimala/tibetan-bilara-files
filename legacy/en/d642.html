<p>Holiest of the wise,</p>
<p>Bestower of boons, abode, and refuge,</p>
<p>Beyond the reach of Māra’s works,</p>

<p>O you to whom all living beings pay homage—</p>
<p>Precious one, we bow to you.</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī spoke, saying oṃ vākyedaṃ namaḥ svāhā.</p>
<p>If one retains the names thus spoken</p>
<p>Together with the vidyāmantra,</p>
<p>One accomplishes the purification of one’s sins.</p>
<p>A person who recites, three times a day,</p>
<p>These eight-more-than-a-hundred names</p>
<p>Is certain to attain their many wishes</p>
<p>In just the way they want them.</p>
<p>If they recollect the felicitous names,</p>
<p>Any terrible acts that have been performed</p>
<p>That equal those of immediate retribution</p>
<p>Will be swiftly purified.</p>
<p>Remembering thus when great frights arise</p>
<p>In transition to the world beyond,</p>
<p>Those purified sentient beings</p>
<p>Will directly encounter Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>The intelligent who, upon remembering,</p>
<p>Compose themselves and recite</p>
<p>Will attain buddhahood if they so desire.</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt.</p>
<p>This concludes the noble “One Hundred and Eight Names of Mañjuśrī.”</p>
