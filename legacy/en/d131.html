<p>The Absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time: The Blessed One was in the Kalandakanivāpa, at the Veṇuvana near Rājagṛha. He was there together with a great saṅgha of twelve hundred fifty monks, and with three hundred million bodhisattvas, all of whom had attained dhāraṇī, unobstructed eloquence, and mastery over absorption. They dwelled in the absorption of emptiness, their domain was free of marks, their aspiration was uncontrived, they dwelled in the absence of wishes, and their conduct was natural. They had attained the dhāraṇīs that accomplish limitless gateways. They had attained acceptance regarding sameness, they had attained sameness, and they had attained unobstructed dhāraṇī. They knew the higher or lower capacities of all beings  and had precise knowledge of beings’ thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>At that time, the Blessed One settled into the absorption that is the blessing of the thus-gone one, that enters the domain of all the buddhas. This absorption is formless, indefinable, ungraspable, unimpeded, and not apparent. It is beyond knowledge and not an object of knowledge. It is free from mentation, mind, and consciousness. It is rootless, unsupported, and beyond observation. It is an incomparable, unequaled, and matchless state. It has no notion of “mine,” is free from grasping, is free from anything to avoid, and is uncreated. It never went and never came. It does not go and does not stay. It is without interruption, baseless, and without marks. It is free of all marks. It is beyond accepting and rejecting. It is uncompounded and beyond any accumulation. It is beyond assembling and beyond separating. It is without mind and free from mind. It is unoriginated, beginningless, unestablished, nonarising, and totally nonoccurring. It is utterly beyond movement, perfectly without movement, totally empty, beyond association, and without superimpositions regarding any phenomenon. It is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas. It is known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal.</p>
<p>As soon as he settled into that absorption, neither the Blessed One’s body nor the characteristics of his body appeared; neither his mind nor the characteristics of his mind appeared; neither his robes nor the characteristics of his robes appeared; neither his cushion nor the characteristics of his cushion appeared; neither his sleeping nor the characteristics of his sleeping appeared; neither his walking nor the characteristics of his walking appeared; neither his rising nor the characteristics of his rising appeared; neither his remaining nor the characteristics of his remaining appeared; neither his shadow nor the characteristics of his shadow appeared; neither his sitting nor the characteristics of his sitting appeared; and neither his sounds nor the characteristics of his sounds appeared.</p>
<p>At that point, through the power of this absorption,  and through the blessings of the Buddha, a bright light filled the entire trichiliocosm. So bright was this light that everywhere in the trichiliocosm the moonlight was outshone, as was the sunlight and the light of stars, fire, jewels, and lightning. The radiance of gandharvas, kinnaras, gods of the realms of desire and form, constellations, and divine palaces was outshone. So too were that of Śakra, Brahmā, and the protectors of the worlds.</p>
<p>Through the Buddha’s blessings and the power of his absorption, some of the gods could no longer smell their divine fragrances, and the whole trichiliocosm was suffused by an aroma sweeter than any other scent that completely transcended the fragrances of the gods. All the dark spaces between the worlds were brought into the light, as were the major and minor mountain ranges that surround the worlds. Mount Meru and all the other principal mountains like it were illuminated, as were the Black Peaks. Subsequently, however, they did not appear to the eye faculties of sentient beings.</p>
<p>The entire trichiliocosm was encompassed in a net of jewels. The entire Sahā buddha realm was decorated with silk hangings, suffused with frankincense, and strewn with a variety of flowers. Through the power of the Buddha, the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, along with Vulture Peak Mountain, became as level as the palm of a hand and were saturated with the delicious and captivating scent of a giant hundred-thousand-petaled lotus flower composed of various jewels the size of chariot-wheels. From the sky, a lattice-like jeweled canopy appeared, which covered and adorned everything. All of Magadha became soft to the touch, like kācilindika cloth.</p>
<p>Then in the east, in as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, the individual blessed buddhas exhorted a limitless, innumerable, and immeasurable number of hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva great beings who were just one life away from unexcelled and perfect awakening,  “Sons of noble family, you should go into the Sahā world. That is where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni presently resides. He lives there and teaches the Dharma. Now he has settled into the absorption that is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. Sons of noble family, even engaging in the six perfections for a hundred thousand eons, but without skillful means, bears no comparison to the esteem bodhisattvas will feel merely hearing about this absorption. Therefore, go and hear about this absorption.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva great beings listened accordingly to the respective thus-gone ones and paid these blessed ones homage. Then, in an instant, they all disappeared from those buddha realms and, by giving rise to their magical powers of superknowledge, they came to the Sahā world, to the four central continents, to the continent of Jambudvīpa, to the town of Rājagṛha, to the Veṇuvana, and into the Kalandakanivāpa, where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni was. Upon arriving, they bowed their heads to the feet of the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. They then circled the Blessed One three times and stood to one side. The Blessed One welcomed them and they took their places cross-legged upon a great lotus composed of various jewels.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in the south, west, north, below, above, —throughout the cardinal and intermediate directions, and everywhere in between. In all the ten directions, in as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, individual blessed buddhas exhorted a limitless, innumerable, and immeasurable number of hundreds of thousands of bodhisattva great beings who were just one life away from unexcelled and perfect awakening, “Sons of noble family, you should go into the Sahā world. That is where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni presently resides. He lives there and teaches the Dharma. Now he has settled into the absorption that is a dhāraṇī gateway to enter the domain of all buddhas, known as the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. Sons of noble family, even engaging in the six perfections for a hundred thousand eons, but without skillful means, bears no comparison to the esteem bodhisattvas will feel merely hearing about this absorption. Therefore, go and hear about this absorption.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva great beings listened accordingly to the respective thus-gone ones and paid these blessed ones homage. Then, in an instant, they all disappeared from those buddha realms and, by giving rise to their magical powers of superknowledge, they came to the Sahā world, to the four central continents, to the continent of Jambudvīpa, to the town of Rājagṛha, to the Veṇuvana, and into the Kalandakanivāpa, where the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni was. Upon arriving, they bowed their heads to the feet of the blessed one, the thus-gone one, the worthy one, the perfect buddha Śākyamuni. They then circled the Blessed One three times and stood to one side. The Blessed One welcomed them and they took their places cross-legged upon a great lotus composed of various jewels.</p>
<p>Throughout this great trichiliocosm, all the monks—whether engaged with the vehicle of the hearers, the vehicle of the solitary buddhas, or the bodhisattva vehicle—each in their own individual realms, stirred and, through the blessings and power of the Buddha, they all came to Vulture Peak Mountain, where the Blessed One resided. Upon arriving, they could not see the Blessed One anywhere. Not seeing him, they joined their palms and paid homage to him.</p>
<p>Through the radiance of the absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal, instantly, in that very moment, eight hundred million bodhisattvas gathered at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where they sat down in the Blessed One’s retinue. Three hundred thousand hearers also gathered together and took their seats. Within this great trichiliocosm, many other beings arrived at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where the Blessed One was. They included Śakra, Brahmā, the guardians of the world, Maheśvara, the gods of the pure realms, all gods including their lords, all nāgas and their lords, all yakṣas and their lords, all gandharvas and their lords, all asuras and their lords, all garuḍas and their lords, all kinnaras and their lords, all mahoragas and their lords, as well as all suparṇis and their lords. Each of these groups also brought with them many quadrillions of servants. As they arrived at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Veṇuvana, where the Blessed One was, no one could see the Blessed One anywhere. Not seeing him, they joined their palms and paid homage to him.</p>
<p>At that time the powerful and eminent bodhisattva great beings, hearers, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, monks, nuns, and male and female lay practitioners were all assembled. No place was left unfilled in this great trichiliocosm, from the peak of existence on down. Not even the space for the tip of a hair was left unfilled.</p>
<p>Then the elder Śāradvatīputra, Mahā­maudgalyāyana, the elder Kauṣṭhila, Mahā­kātyāyana, Mahā­kāśyapa, the venerable Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, and the elder Subhūti—all those great hearers—turned to the youthful Mañjuśrī and asked, “Mañjuśrī, where is the Thus-Gone One right now? What does his body look like? How is he present?”</p>
<p>The youthful Mañjuśrī replied to the great hearers, “Venerable ones, you are great hearers, and you possess insight and miraculous abilities. You are powerful and mighty, you have mastered the absorptions of the erudite, and you have long observed pure conduct. Venerable ones, you should enter your own absorptions and search for the Thus-Gone One’s body and his presence. You should strive to discover where the Thus-Gone One’s body is, what his body is like, and how he is present.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the hearers settled into their own absorptions and investigated this entire trichiliocosm. They looked, but they still could not see the Thus-Gone One’s body,  nor could they see his presence. Then, when the great hearers did not see the Thus-Gone One’s body nor his presence upon completely investigating the trichiliocosm, they arose from their respective absorptions and addressed the youthful Mañjuśrī as follows: “Mañjuśrī, we fail to see the Thus-Gone One’s body or his presence.”</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī replied to the great hearers, “Then all you venerable great hearers must silently join your palms and one-pointedly hold the Thus-Gone One in your mind for a moment. Do this, and you will see his body and witness his presence.”</p>
<p>Just then, the Blessed One, who was aware and cognizant of this, emerged from his absorption. As soon as the Blessed One emerged from his absorption, the entire trichiliocosm shook in six ways, with eighteen signs: it quivered, trembled, and quaked; it wobbled, rocked, and swayed; it vibrated, shuddered, and reeled; it rattled, shook, and convulsed; it clattered, rattled, and clanged; and it boomed, thundered, and roared. The world became exceedingly brilliant, open, and vivid.</p>
<p>As an offering to the Blessed One, a rain of divine flowers fell to the accompaniment of divine cymbals and song. At that point venerable Śāradvatīputra arose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked,  “Blessed One, in what kind of absorption did you abide so that even the eye of insight of the great hearers was unable to see the Thus-Gone One’s body? Blessed One, what is the Thus-Gone One’s presence like?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to venerable Śāradvatīputra, “Śāradvatīputra, this absorption is not a stage of the hearers or solitary buddhas. Śāradvatīputra, it is on the level of the thus-gone ones. This magical display and miracle of the buddhas is inconceivable. Nevertheless, Śāradvatīputra, listen well and keep this in mind. I will now teach you a little bit about the body of the Thus-Gone One.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Blessed One!” Venerable Śāradvatīputra replied, and he listened as the Blessed One had instructed.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One explained to him, “Śāradvatīputra, the true body of the Thus-Gone One transcends any view, like the sky. It is incorporeal, uncreated, unborn, and unceasing. It is nonoccurring, truly nonoccurring, and utterly nonoccurring. It is unobtained, unimputed, nonengaging, unestablished, boundless, and limitless. It is peaceful, placid, and absolutely serene. It is nonabiding, nonarising, ineffable, beyond mind, and beyond origination. It is unmoving, utterly unmoving, and free of movement. It is totally pure. It is nothing whatsoever and exists in no way. It is beyond appropriation and acceptance. It is without motion, without activity, and without support. It is unborn, unarisen, without action, and without ripening. It is unseen, unheard, uncognized, detached, not bound, and not released. It does not exist. It is not recalled, not held, not experienced, and not seen.  It is beyond cognition, is not an object of cognition, and is characterized by absence of cognition.</p>
<p>“It is without mind. It is unfathomable and unimaginable. It is not mind. It is devoid of mind. It possesses the mind of sameness. Nothing is the same as it, and it cannot be comprehended by any act of mind. It has not gone anywhere, does not go anywhere, is without going, and has eliminated any going. It is uninterrupted, immeasurable, uninterruptible, boundless, unobservable, and marvelous. It has no substance and is no substance. It is insubstantial. It is not a distinction and has no distinctions. It is nonarising, truly nonarising, unshakable, nondiscursive, nonconceptual, beginningless, unestablished, and wholly unestablished. It is not accomplished, without pervasion, and motionless. It is not clear, not tangible, and not a thing to be desired. It has no light and does not appear. It is not apprehended and has no appearance. It is without darkness, is not darkness, and is free of darkness. It is not lucidity. It is without abode and free of abode. It is not at peace, by no means at peace, without peace, and free from peace. It is the same as peace. It is pure, totally pure, and wholly pure.</p>
<p>“It is nothing whatsoever, beyond appropriation, and without perpetuation. It is without friendship, without strife, and free from strife. It is present through its way of not being present. It is without ties, free from ties, limpid, and unsullied. It does not die or take rebirth. It will not die or take rebirth. It is without Dharma and without non-Dharma. It is without a field, and also without anything other than a field. It is inexhaustible, not something that can be exhausted, and free from exhaustion. It is without dust, instantaneous, and unshakable. It is beyond syllables, sounds, tones, explanations, trainings, and mind. It is without logic and not illogical, and it is not separate from logic. It does not possess anything and is without possession. It is also not destitute. It is inexhaustible,  not inexhaustible, immortal, and not immortal.</p>
<p>“It is not something to be pacified. It is without marks, not something without marks, not limited, not unlimited, and not something to be measured. It has not gone and has not come. It is nondual and not nondual. It is not perceived, not here, and not there. It is baseless, without abode, nonemerging, indestructible, nontransferable, and nothing to be heard. It does not conquer enemies. It accepts nothing and rejects nothing. It is without characteristics, free of characteristics, not a characteristic itself, and it has abandoned characteristics. It is without action and not without action. It is without marks, not without marks, and adorned with marks. It is gateless, unattached, and free from attachments. It inspires faith. It is without connections and free from connections. It causes delight and it causes bliss. It is freed from the six sense sources and invisible.</p>
<p>“It is reality—thoroughly distinguished by suchness. It is suchness, which liberates beings by not liberating. It liberates by not liberating sentient beings. It purifies sentient beings by way of not purifying. It protects sentient beings by way of not protecting. It teaches the Dharma to sentient beings by way of nonduality. Nothing is the same as it, it is incomparable, without likeness, and peerless. It is the same as that which is not present, the same as space, and the same as that which does not remain. It is exceedingly even, unborn, and the same as unborn. It does not apprehend and is the same as nonapprehension. It is not at peace, is free from peace, and its peace has waned. It is at peace, very much at peace, and thoroughly at peace. It is gentle, supple, utterly stainless, utterly controlled, not permanent, and not interrupted. It has withdrawn from activities. It is irreversibly brave. It has vanquished fear. It is beyond return.  It has severed all grasping and cut through all ties.</p>
<p>“It is clear, without distinctions, nondual, free from duality, and taught to be without any duality. Its essence being unproduced, its nature is luminosity that is utterly beyond occurring. Without any liberation, it is liberated from activity. It is without meeting, without separating, not long, not short, not round, not square, not spherical, and not substantial. It is not perceived as the aggregates, elements, or sense sources. It cannot be established as something conditioned, nor does it emerge from the unconditioned. It is nonwaxing, nonwaning, nonaccumulating, and unborn. No one can see it, hear it, or be conscious of it. It is neither real nor unreal. It is unborn. It does not die or transmigrate. It does not coexist with the world, nor does it not coexist with the world.</p>
<p>“That body is unwavering, unmistaken, unexcited, motionless, and undeviating. It is without cultivation and free from cultivation. It is nonoccurring, not destroyed, not an essence, and not without essence. It is without mind and indescribable. It is without connection and does not connect, nor does it not connect. It has no attachment to desires, nor is it without attachment to desires. It is nothing and it is not nothing. It is without characteristics and is not without characteristics. It does not transcend suffering and has not fully transcended suffering. It is not present, but it is not without presence, either. Śāradvatīputra, can sentient beings who fixate on characteristics and who have fallen into dualistic perception possibly understand the way in which the body of the Thus-Gone One abides?”</p>
<p>“No, Blessed One, they cannot at all,” replied Śāradvatīputra. “That is impossible.  And why? Because, Blessed One, the Thus-Gone One’s body is free of any and all marks.”</p>
<p>“Śāradvatīputra, yes, that is correct. That is how it is,” the Blessed One agreed. “The Thus-Gone One’s body is free from any and all marks.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then proceeded to teach extensively about the absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal. In order to be comprehensive and thorough, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“This body is not a body, and it is completely free from a body.</p>
<p>Nobody has created it, nobody destroys it, and no one obtains it.</p>
<p>It is absolutely bereft of properties, yet it is not bereft.</p>
<p>Such are the terms applied to the body of the well-gone ones.</p>
<p>“It is without meeting, parting, abode, or substance.</p>
<p>It is neither grasped, nor freed, nor even, nor is it long.</p>
<p>It has no beginning, no impediment, nor is it present anywhere at all.</p>
<p>This is how the body of the well-gone ones is explained.</p>
<p>“It is not grasped, is not made, has no place, and is nothing at all.</p>
<p>It has no form and no mind, and it is neither two nor one.</p>
<p>It is unreal, not unreal, and not nonoccurring.</p>
<p>The body of the victorious ones is like this in its true state.</p>
<p>“It is without a core, not weak, and not interrupted.</p>
<p>It is not disrupted, nonoccurring, unoriginated, and without destruction.</p>
<p>It is without obtainment, purified of dust, and not destroyed.</p>
<p>The body of the stainless ones should be understood like this.</p>
<p>“It is not seen, heard, held, or touched.</p>
<p>It is not perceived and not analyzed; rather, it is like a hallucination.</p>
<p>When beings see it, they are delighted to apprehend it.</p>
<p>This is how the body of the buddhas is taught to be.</p>
<p>“It is not an aggregate, not an element, not false, and not true.</p>
<p>It is not pure, utterly not pure, and not encountered by the senses.</p>
<p>It is without concepts, utterly nonconceptual, and like the moon in water.</p>
<p>This is how we should hold the body of the well-gone ones to be.</p>
<p>“Since this body comes from causes and conditions, it has no intrinsic nature.</p>
<p>It is unborn, unceasing, not going, and unmoving.</p>
<p>Under analysis, the three worlds appear like an illusion.</p>
<p>The body of the victorious ones must be seen nonconceptually like this.</p>
<p>“It has no peace, is not at peace, is free from peace, and unconnected.</p>
<p>It is without desire, without reason, and like an empty hand.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is naturally spacious.</p>
<p>Seeing it thus, one honors the Buddha day and night.</p>
<p>“You might fill billions of realms with jewels,</p>
<p>All the way up to the peak of existence,</p>
<p>And offer it to the buddhas until the end of time.</p>
<p>Yet that generosity cannot compare to copying this sūtra.</p>
<p>“You might cultivate loving kindness with equanimity toward all beings</p>
<p>For as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>Yet that discipline cannot match the patience of someone</p>
<p>Who feels confidence in the supreme absorption of the wisdom seal.</p>
<p>“You might have forbearance toward every being for as many eons</p>
<p>As have passed in the infinity of cyclic existence.</p>
<p>Yet if you develop a single moment of trust in this seal of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>The former merit, compared to this, will seem like a mustard seed next to Mount Meru.</p>
<p>“You might honor as many beings as there are in the three worlds,</p>
<p>By carrying them over your head for many eons,</p>
<p>Without ever feeling tired or bothered.</p>
<p>Still, such diligence cannot compare to this patience.</p>
<p>“You might practice concentration for more eons</p>
<p>Than there are dust motes in a hundred buddha realms.</p>
<p>Still, compared to applying yourself to this sūtra for a single day,</p>
<p>That merit is no match for this patience.</p>
<p>“You might persevere in the insight that abandons the two extremes</p>
<p>For as many countless eons as there are particles in the world.</p>
<p>Still, if anyone realizes this wisdom, just as I have taught,</p>
<p>The former merit, compared to this, will seem like a drop of water next to the ocean.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the Victorious One, do not look for forms or features.</p>
<p>Do not regard the Well-Gone One as would a child.</p>
<p>Whoever sees me as Subhūti sees me</p>
<p>Trains in every kind of generosity found anywhere in the trichiliocosm.”</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had spoken these verses, he continued to address the elder Śāradvatīputra:  “Śāradvatīputra, this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal is the perfection of the stainless wisdom vision of all bodhisattvas in the worlds throughout the ten directions. Śāradvatīputra, whoever wants to see the blessed buddhas should train in this absorption with an altruistic intention. Such bodhisattvas, practicing with altruistic intention, are able to see the Thus-Gone One within the course of just a single day.</p>
<p>“Moreover, Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattvas who desire to see the blessed buddhas in all the buddha realms of the ten directions should train day and night in this absorption. When bodhisattvas apply themselves with altruistic intention, they come to see the blessed buddhas in all the buddha realms of the ten directions. Śāradvatīputra, this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal accomplishes the dhāraṇī Dharma method that brings about infinite gateways for bodhisattvas. It is the basis for all dhāraṇī gateways. From it the dhāraṇī gateways emerge. This absorption will bring about for bodhisattvas their great being’s thirty-two marks and complete their eighty excellent signs. Whoever trains in this absorption of the bodhisattvas will purify all karmic obscurations, overcome all kinds of demonic activity, and will neither honor nor experience the Thus-Gone One as a regular being. Whoever trains in this absorption of the bodhisattvas, no matter what they say it will not be mistaken. All their physical actions, whatever they may be, will be faultless. All their verbal actions, whatever they may be, will be free from being the origin of suffering. All their mental activity, whatever it may be, will be free of affliction.</p>
<p>“Śāradvatīputra, bodhisattvas who wish to understand the hidden teaching of the thus-gone ones should train in this absorption.  Wanting to understand Dharma teachings, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to teach Dharma discourses, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to understand the way of truth, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to actualize the limit of reality, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to understand dependent origination, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to know the inclinations of sentient beings, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to apprehend the excellent display of qualities in the buddha realms at will, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to attain excellent luminosity, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to perfect an excellent retinue, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to perfect an excellent lifespan, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to perfect an excellent arrangement, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to perfect the excellent teaching, they should train in this absorption. Wanting to fulfill the wishes of bodhisattva great beings and others, they should train in this absorption. They should train in this absorption in order to investigate, trust, write, read, remember, retain, and meditate.</p>
<p>“Why is this? Because within this absorption, none of that is difficult. Śāradvatīputra, this absorption is like a precious wish-fulfilling jewel that provides for all wants. It is a wish-granting tree that fulfills all beings’ wishes. Śāradvatīputra, thus this absorption completely fulfills all the intentions of bodhisattva great beings.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“This sūtra of the seal of infinite wisdom</p>
<p>Is a mass of wisdom, a distinguished and sublime wisdom,</p>
<p>A wisdom light, a wisdom treasury,</p>
<p>A wisdom source, and an entrance to the gateway to wisdom.</p>
<p>“It is powerful insight, the source of insight, the site of insight,</p>
<p>The lamp of insight, the light of insight that dispels darkness,</p>
<p>The inexhaustible insight, and the way of insight.</p>
<p>Like the sun, it accompanies the three worlds.</p>
<p>“It is sameness, abides in sameness,</p>
<p>Cuts through all grasping, and is the way of truth,</p>
<p>The gateway to all absorptions, and the seal of wisdom.</p>
<p>It is the vision of the buddhas’ discriminating awareness.</p>
<p>“It is an inexhaustible treasury that takes you to the other side.</p>
<p>It is miraculous insight, the source of insight, and a treasure.</p>
<p>It is the root of the happiness of having one’s wishes fulfilled.</p>
<p>This absorption seal is the well-gone ones’ wealth.</p>
<p>“It is the luxurious kingdom enjoyed by the king.</p>
<p>It is the source of excellent, supreme jewels.</p>
<p>It clears away the dust of passion and the stain of aggression.</p>
<p>This sūtra teaching is the root of precious things.</p>
<p>“It is peaceful, at peace, and sets your mind in peace.</p>
<p>It makes you beautiful and purifies the belief in a self.</p>
<p>When you discover this dhāraṇī seal of the buddhas,</p>
<p>You destroy Māra with this heroic weapon.</p>
<p>“Its wisdom knows all beings in existence.</p>
<p>This insight is the source of wisdom, a wisdom fortune.</p>
<p>It is the light of wisdom, an infinite transcendence.</p>
<p>This sūtra is the source of the gateway to wisdom.</p>
<p>“It cuts through the two knots of discipline and training.</p>
<p>It purifies the sixty-two conceptual views.</p>
<p>It is the conqueror’s gateway; it obtains ambrosia.</p>
<p>It is the source of the thirty-two marks.</p>
<p>“It is awakening; it agrees with full awakening.</p>
<p>It reveals extremist positions and the cause of awakening.</p>
<p>This awakening rouses you from sleep.</p>
<p>This way of awakening is infinite and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>“It is the way of Dharma, which cultivates reason.</p>
<p>It accomplishes infinite dhāraṇīs.</p>
<p>It engages in the Dharma of the ten powers.</p>
<p>This dhāraṇī is like the ocean.</p>
<p>“This is the accomplishment of the perfection of generosity.</p>
<p>This is the perfection of discipline and patience.</p>
<p>It is inexhaustible diligence, concentration, and insight.</p>
<p>To rest in it is the completion of all the perfections.</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid of karma and disturbing emotions.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of the demon of wrong understanding.</p>
<p>For those who connect with this, there are no obstacles.</p>
<p>Just as you wish, you will manifest awakening.</p>
<p>“Those who have traveled throughout the ten directions</p>
<p>To receive this discourse are certain vessels for awakening.</p>
<p>The offspring dwelling during this fortunate eon</p>
<p>Are all witnesses to this.</p>
<p>“This is the mother of the buddhas of the past.</p>
<p>This sūtra is the mother of those not yet come.</p>
<p>And all the present buddhas are born from it.</p>
<p>Therefore, kinsmen of the conqueror, apply yourselves to this!</p>
<p>“Those who live according to this sūtra</p>
<p>Attain the Thus-Gone One’s wealth.</p>
<p>They purify karma and perfect their conduct.</p>
<p>They become nonregressing and go beyond the swamp.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One delivered this Dharma teaching, many hundreds of billions of bodhisattvas, as numerous as the grains of sand in thirty Ganges rivers, attained this absorption. Six trillion eight hundred billion bodhisattvas purified the karmic obscurations accumulated over a hundred thousand eons and their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening became irreversible. All of them attained the dhāraṇī called accomplishing the inexhaustible moment. Six quintillion gods and humans who had previously failed to arouse the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening now aroused this mind and rejoiced in this absorption. Due to the roots of virtue resulting from rejoicing in this absorption, their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening became irreversible. Then the Blessed One prophesied that after three million eons, all of them would become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect buddhas known as Fearless One.  Some among them would, after having made aspirations for a long time, accomplish patience. For others among them, their aspirations would quickly bring them to various buddha realms, there to awaken fully to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. However, all of them would share the name Fearless One.</p>
<p>The Blessed One now gazed out over this entire retinue and addressed Mañjuśrī, saying, “Mañjuśrī, for these reasons you must remain without apprehending anything, and by delighting in the absence of conceptual thinking you must practice nonabiding. Not dwelling on any phenomenon, you must maintain this accomplishment of unsurpassed and perfect awakening over many countless quadrillions of eons. You must embrace it, hold it, and teach it elaborately to others. You must delight in the absence of conceptual thinking. You must practice nonabiding. You must not dwell upon anything and be free from envy.”</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, since there are no phenomena to be grasped, I am happy to maintain and protect this unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Blessed One, as for awakening, it is nothing at all. It comes from nowhere. It is found nowhere. It does not come about through anything. It is nothing whatsoever. It does not appear. It is ungraspable, unattainable, and inexhaustible.”</p>
<p>Then the three billion bodhisattvas in the retinue rose from their seats. They joined their palms and addressed the Blessed One:  “Blessed One, as for this accomplishment of the unsurpassed and perfect awakening of the thus-gone ones that spans countless quadrillions of eons, we are happy to maintain it, hold it, explain it, and teach it elaborately to others.”</p>
<p>All those bodhisattvas then offered their own robes for the body of the Blessed One, and they made aspirations.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Maitreya, remember your intention to uphold the Dharma in a future life, in the future, during the final five hundred years! This will be your task!”</p>
<p>At this the bodhisattva great being Maitreya rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Joining his palms, he bowed toward the Blessed One and said, “Blessed One, I remember my intention to uphold the sacred Dharma!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Maitreya, among the three billion bodhisattvas, eight thousand of them uphold the holy Dharma and will continue to do so. As for the other bodhisattvas, they are incorrigibly attached to grasping at objective perceptions. They will not uphold the holy Dharma. In the future, during the final five hundred years, they will abandon my unsurpassed and perfect awakening, which I have accomplished over countless quadrillions of eons. They will go against it. They will not teach it. They will not uphold it. They will not uphold it at all.</p>
<p>“Why is this? Maitreya, bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening in seven ways.  What are these seven? Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening inspired by the blessed buddhas. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening in order to protect the holy Dharma when that holy Dharma is disappearing. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening when they feel great compassion on seeing the realms of beings afflicted by so many pains. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening inspired by other bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening themselves when they have respectfully given beautiful gifts to bodhisattvas who have aroused the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening when they see others arouse the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening on hearing perfect praises sung about the qualities of the various ornaments of the thus-gone ones’ body, such as the excellent marks and signs. Maitreya, these are the seven ways in which bodhisattvas arouse the mind of awakening.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, as I have just mentioned, there are those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening because of the blessed buddhas, and those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening in order to preserve the holy Dharma at a time when it is disappearing, and those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening due to feelings of great compassion caused by witnessing the realms of sentient beings afflicted with all kinds of suffering. Maitreya, those bodhisattvas who arouse the mind of awakening in these three ways are maintaining the blessed buddhas’ awakening. Their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening quickly becomes irreversible. The four other ways of arousing the mind of awakening are for incorrigible bodhisattvas who do not uphold the holy Dharma.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, there are five qualities that bodhisattvas must have for their progress to become irreversible.  What are the five? They have the same attitude toward all sentient beings. They do not envy the success and prestige of others. Even if their lives are threatened, they will speak nothing but praise of monks who uphold the sacred Dharma. They are not attached to worldly success sought through knowledge of the Dharma, nor to acquisitions, prestige, or compliments. They are devoted to the profound Dharma, and without interest in any kind of mundane activity keep the profound Dharma with them in all situations. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know that their progress will be irreversible.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess five other qualities, know them to be incorrigible. What are the five? They have little charisma and do not follow any advice. They are interested in base things and give degraded teachings to others. They are attached to worldly success sought through knowledge of the Dharma, acquistions, and prestige, and behave enviously in the patron’s household. They are fraudulent and deceitful. Their verbal professions do not lead toward emptiness. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know them to be incorrigible.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess the following five qualities, know them to be irreversible in their progress. What are they? They do not perceive a self, and they do not extol a self. They do not perceive any sentient beings. They do not use concepts to teach about the realm of reality. They do not perceive awakening. They do not regard the Thus-Gone One’s body as having the characteristics of form. Maitreya, if bodhisattvas possess these five qualities, know that they will not regress from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One spoke the following verses:</p>
<p>“Those who are envious, who covet worldly success through knowledge,</p>
<p>Who harm, who are fraudulent and insulting, and</p>
<p>Those who are all talk and whose conduct is petty</p>
<p>Are not able to guard the awakening of the well-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Yet those who delight in solitude and live in desolate wildernesses,</p>
<p>Paying more than lip service and persevering in what is profound,</p>
<p>Are like the rhinoceros, shun the pleasure of worldly success through knowledge,</p>
<p>And guard against awakening’s destruction.</p>
<p>“Far away from crowds, they are intent on absolute peace.</p>
<p>Like antelopes, they are skittish and wander homelessly.</p>
<p>Like the wind in the sky, they are not attached to property.</p>
<p>Such are those who uphold the teachings of the victorious ones.</p>
<p>“As they have no regard for their bodies, and make no efforts to survive,</p>
<p>Surely they have also renounced worldly success.</p>
<p>Their efforts are not for themselves in any way.</p>
<p>In the future, they will be vessels of awakening.</p>
<p>“In the future, there will appear beings,</p>
<p>Who proclaim, ‘We are awakened.’</p>
<p>Their haughty and pretentious ways will be marred by afflictions.</p>
<p>Such people will be unable to uphold this teaching.</p>
<p>“Billions of eons before</p>
<p>The teacher Dīpaṃkara,</p>
<p>I remember that the buddha called Śaśiketu appeared.</p>
<p>He taught this absorption to beings.</p>
<p>“That victorious one’s first retinue</p>
<p>Consisted of eighty trillion irreversible beings.</p>
<p>The second, seven trillion.</p>
<p>The third, seven trillion three hundred billion.</p>
<p>“That victorious one’s lifespan lasted many millions of eons,</p>
<p>And his light shone over sixty-three leagues.</p>
<p>His saṅgha was ninety-nine million strong,</p>
<p>And all of them were powerful worthy ones.</p>
<p>“At that time there was a king,</p>
<p>A wheel-turning sovereign named Puṇyodgata.</p>
<p>His realm was as vast as Jambudvīpa,</p>
<p>Some twenty thousand leagues.</p>
<p>“It was as large as the four continents.</p>
<p>The king had six hundred million queens</p>
<p>And at least one thousand sons.</p>
<p>The name of his palace was Pleasing Light.</p>
<p>“His realm contained eight hundred million towns,</p>
<p>Each situated within lush and beautiful parks.</p>
<p>With bountiful harvests, this realm was delightful and enjoyable.</p>
<p>It was like the Vaijayanta Palace in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p>“In a dream, the king heard</p>
<p>That the buddha Śaśiketu had come.</p>
<p>With six hundred million servants and attendants,</p>
<p>He sought him out.</p>
<p>“The king prayed, ‘After hearing the teaching of this sūtra</p>
<p>On the profound absorption that is the body of the Victorious One,</p>
<p>May I experience emptiness, precisely as intended.’</p>
<p>Then he offered his entire kingdom to that buddha.</p>
<p>“In all the cities, he commissioned</p>
<p>Temples to the Thus-Gone One made of sandalwood.</p>
<p>He offered them with joy and delight,</p>
<p>And covered the ground he tread upon with gold leaf.</p>
<p>“For a full eighty thousand years</p>
<p>The king did nothing but make offerings,</p>
<p>Never wearying or sleeping.</p>
<p>Without succumbing to desire, he did not crave his kingdom.</p>
<p>“All the arrays of things he offered</p>
<p>To the Thus-Gone One each day,</p>
<p>In order that this absorption would be disclosed,</p>
<p>Cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>“Still, since it remained hidden, the king began to think,</p>
<p>‘Since this absorption is extremely profound,</p>
<p>It is impossible to accomplish this absorption, the wisdom seal,</p>
<p>While clinging to worldly goods.’</p>
<p>“Thus, he went forth as a monk and renounced his kingdom.</p>
<p>He dressed in hemp robes and collected alms.</p>
<p>For a full eighty thousand years,</p>
<p>He did not succumb to sleep and trained in absorption.</p>
<p>“During that time, he retained whatever</p>
<p>Teachings that buddha gave.</p>
<p>When the Well-Gone One passed into the space of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>He built six hundred forty million stūpas.</p>
<p>“To each, he offered five hundred parasols</p>
<p>Adorned and beautified with the seven precious substances.</p>
<p>To each, a hundred cymbals were rung,</p>
<p>And a hundred thousand lamps were offered.</p>
<p>“For seven hundred thirty billion years</p>
<p>He lived his life with few possessions.</p>
<p>Having thus abided, free from worldly distractions,</p>
<p>He taught this absorption to his retinue.</p>
<p>“He did not desire even praise,</p>
<p>Let alone any success gained through knowledge.</p>
<p>Wishing to preserve the Dharma,</p>
<p>He renounced all invitations to meals for the monastics.</p>
<p>“He then pleased thus-gone ones</p>
<p>Numbering seven trillion eight hundred million.</p>
<p>He offered such arrays to them all,</p>
<p>And he obtained this absorption from each of them.</p>
<p>“Whoever wishes to preserve this awakening</p>
<p>Should meditate devotedly, without desire,</p>
<p>And with unwavering altruistic motivation,</p>
<p>Just like that king trained.</p>
<p>“Yet there are others who strive for wealth, without concern for the Dharma;</p>
<p>Such undisciplined beings may claim to train in awakening.</p>
<p>In the future, people with such claims will appear.</p>
<p>They will delight in chattering and say that everything is empty.</p>
<p>“Yet they will not understand things to be empty in the way of emptiness itself.</p>
<p>Their lives will be full of desire, harshness, and afflictions.</p>
<p>Encouraging emptiness to be grasped through words,</p>
<p>They will say, ‘I am awakened—beyond the shadow of a doubt.’</p>
<p>“At that time, the supreme king’s lifespan will become infinite.</p>
<p>His thousand children of this fortunate eon</p>
<p>And the many in the retinue seated in front of him</p>
<p>Will all take vows and go forth.</p>
<p>“Recollecting the myriad victorious ones</p>
<p>Under whom I went forth,</p>
<p>All the words I have taught are only what they taught,</p>
<p>And remaining in that, I also cultivated emptiness.</p>
<p>“While adhering for infinite eons to such a method,</p>
<p>I made offerings to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Yet I did not attain awakening thereby</p>
<p>Until, because I had remained in it,</p>
<p>“As soon as I saw Dīpaṃkara</p>
<p>I cast away uncertainties, beheld sameness,</p>
<p>And the Guide then gave me the prophecy:</p>
<p>‘You will become the buddha named Śākyasiṃha.’ ”</p>
<p>At that point King Bimbisāra’s true queen, Śrībhadrā, who was the mother of Ajātaśatru, and Suvarṇottamaprabhāsā, who was the daughter of Kṣemavatī, also a true queen of King Bimbisāra, were seated as members of that very assembly. Queen Śrībhadrā and Suvarṇottamaprabhāsā both rose from their seats and approached the Blessed One. They draped their shawls over their left shoulders and knelt on their right knees. Joining their palms, they bowed toward the Blessed One. With reverence and respect, they each offered to the Blessed One’s body a gift of priceless woven fabrics. Then, setting forth five hundred bowls of the flowers of the seven precious substances,  they made the following promise:</p>
<p>“Blessed One, in the future, during the final five hundred years, we two shall be devoted to this precious absorption. We shall ensure that others trust it, appreciate it, remember it, study it, understand it, and teach it extensively to others, by serving and venerating those Dharma teachers who uphold discourses such as this, with offerings of clothing, food, bedding, healing medicines, and other necessities. We shall work to mature sentient beings into unsurpassed and perfect awakening. We shall not abandon emptiness. We shall not be occupied with words but practice sincerely. Blessed One, never mind any outer material concerns, we shall do so without regard even for our bodies and lives.”</p>
<p>Following the two queens’ example, the retinue of King Bimbisāra’s queens, which consisted of a hundred thousand girls, rose from their seats and joined their palms. Those who had embarked on the path to unsurpassed and perfect awakening rejoiced in this absorption and said, “Blessed One, in the future, during the final five hundred years, we too shall gladly embrace the sacred Dharma.” The sixty thousand female lay practitioners of Magadha who had also embarked for unsurpassed and perfect awakening rejoiced in this absorption. Rejoicing, they said, “In the future, during the final five hundred years, we too shall gladly embrace the sacred Dharma.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One smiled. As is the nature of the blessed buddhas, when he smiled, light radiated from the Blessed One’s mouth in hundreds of thousands of distinct, manifold colors—blue,  yellow, red, white, violet, crystalline, and silver. This light beamed from his mouth and illuminated boundless, infinite world systems. It subdued all demonic abodes and extended even up to the world of Brahmā. Its brilliance outshone the light of the sun and the moon and pacified the painful feelings of all beings born in hell, the animal realm, and the world of the Lord of Death. Returning back, it swirled around the Blessed One hundreds of thousands of times and disappeared back into the crown of his head.</p>
<p>At this point Śrībhadrā and Suvarṇottamaprabhāsā, who was the daughter of Kṣemavatī, rose from their seats, draped their shawls over their left shoulders, and knelt on their right knees. Joining their palms, they bowed toward the Blessed One. They praised him with these melodious verses and asked him about the purpose behind his smile:</p>
<p>“Supreme being with so many qualities, unlike anyone in the three existences,</p>
<p>Your hundreds of qualities radiate like the moon in the sky.</p>
<p>Your smile is so beautiful and your speech so sweet!</p>
<p>With your ten powers, please tell us why you smiled.</p>
<p>“Foremost being, please survey the world with your smiling face, which is like the moon.</p>
<p>Your voice is so gentle—the beautiful and clear voice of Brahmā.</p>
<p>It soothes the mind and pleases the body, fully satisfying our minds.</p>
<p>O Teacher, best of men, please reveal the cause of your lion-like smile.</p>
<p>“Your speech is untroubled, unsullied, and not lacking in any way.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rich, even-toned, and beautifully sweet.</p>
<p>Differentiating between the trillions of differing attitudes among people,</p>
<p>You who possess every kind of precious quality, please explain your smile.</p>
<p>“Your speech possesses the eight factors and sixty branches;</p>
<p>Your voice contains seven hundred languages and six hundred million syllables.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s voice has one hundred eighty billion applications.</p>
<p>Please declare the true and boundless causes behind your smile.</p>
<p>“Like the supreme mountain, others do not sway you.</p>
<p>You discern a hundred differing attitudes and totally dismantle ambivalence.</p>
<p>You pacify the suffering of existence and grant beings happiness.</p>
<p>Please explain in detail about your lovely smile.</p>
<p>“Your body is like a jeweled offering pillar, delightful like a golden mountain.</p>
<p>Your face has the appearance of a hundred-petaled lotus in full bloom.</p>
<p>You have the overwhelming power of a lion, the roar of the lord of beasts.</p>
<p>Please reveal the meaning of your laughing smile.</p>
<p>“In the three worlds, you are unequaled and have none of the three stains.</p>
<p>Acting beautifully, you thoroughly pacify and delight the hundreds of existences.</p>
<p>Your smile illuminates all within the ten directions.</p>
<p>Tell us swiftly and in detail about the nectar that clears away darkness.</p>
<p>“The lute, clay drum, one-string, three-string, conch, and flute;</p>
<p>kinnaras, nightingales, and cuckoos;</p>
<p>Swans, cranes, large drums, and tabors—</p>
<p>Even if resounding together, they would not equal a fraction of the Buddha’s speech.</p>
<p>“In these vast assemblies, which have come here from the ten directions,</p>
<p>Are a great number of intelligent beings, as well as some with poor intelligence.</p>
<p>They have come from many places, having gained results and accomplished their training.</p>
<p>Please explain how these beings will eliminate the vine of craving.</p>
<p>“This boundless and sacred assembly comes from millions of realms.</p>
<p>The best of men from the ten directions sent forth these beings who desire the Dharma.</p>
<p>Surely, having heard of this accomplishment, they will be delighted.</p>
<p>So please bring down a rain of Dharma that explains the reasons for your smile.”</p>
<p>In reply, the Blessed One spoke these verses to queen Śrībhadrā and Suvarṇottamaprabhāsā:</p>
<p>“I remember, innumerable eons ago, as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges,</p>
<p>There was a guide of the world called Puṇyaraśmi.</p>
<p>That teacher’s life spanned seven hundred million years.</p>
<p>That Dharma king’s saṅgha of hearers was infinite.</p>
<p>“Then appeared a wheel-turning king, Prajñāsārathi.</p>
<p>His two wives, Keturājñī and Arcī, were utterly free from attachment.</p>
<p>Desiring the Dharma, they went forth</p>
<p>And kept their precepts for millions of years.</p>
<p>“During those days, they maintained the precepts</p>
<p>Of six hundred three million guides.</p>
<p>In the future, when the precepts of the world protectors—as many as there are grains of sand</p>
<p>In thirty Ganges rivers—weaken, they will preserve them together.</p>
<p>“Throughout those lives, you two were together as those beings,</p>
<p>And eventually, you became the wives of the king Prajñāsārathi.</p>
<p>Through having preserved the Dharma, in the future you will cast off your female forms</p>
<p>And behold the thus-gone one Amitābha in Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>“Moreover, during the end times, all other followers</p>
<p>Will set out with the intent to safeguard awakening.</p>
<p>They will become the victors’ sons, adorned with the thirty signs,</p>
<p>Seated upon blooming lotus flowers in Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>“In that realm they will devotedly pay homage to the teacher,</p>
<p>And in the eon without enemies called Vyūharāja,</p>
<p>All of them will attain the highest awakening of buddhahood.</p>
<p>They will remain, so that all gods and humans can practice the Dharma.</p>
<p>“In that buddha realm there will be no demonic activity,</p>
<p>And at that time, hearers will be unheard of.</p>
<p>All actions will be flawless; there will be no lower realms, and no one will enter the womb.</p>
<p>Infinite numbers of bodhisattvas will always congregate there.</p>
<p>“Those who give up their lives to guard the awakening of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>Who desire no profit and have no regard for their own lives,</p>
<p>Will soon abide in the highest awakening of buddhahood.</p>
<p>Just as they desire, they will travel to the buddha realms.</p>
<p>“In this way, during the time of great quarrels, you must get along,</p>
<p>Delight in the buddhas, and, respectfully and without envy, preserve my awakening!</p>
<p>In that future time of divisions,</p>
<p>Do not follow those who long for wealth.</p>
<p>“As I pursued the meaningful qualities of buddhahood for millions of eons,</p>
<p>I relinquished my wives, sons, daughters, kingdoms, heads, and eyes.</p>
<p>Those senseless ones will destroy my Dharma with a lust for wealth.</p>
<p>For the sake of profit and gain, they will be hostile to one another.</p>
<p>“During the end times, you will guard awakening with your sincere intention.</p>
<p>To that end you will act, impelled by the tears of eight hundred million beings.</p>
<p>The trichiliocosm will stir, and the gods will rain down flowers.</p>
<p>Whoever delights in this sūtra will discover a treasure.</p>
<p>“All the guides in the ten directions will be delighted.</p>
<p>The gods will praise them in wonderful garlands of song.</p>
<p>In the future, whoever hears and trains in this sūtra of the wisdom seal</p>
<p>Will receive the offerings of the gods and the protection of the yakṣas.</p>
<p>“One may fill with gold as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges,</p>
<p>And offer it all to the guides for as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>Yet this would not approach the accumulation of merit</p>
<p>Of those who accept this discourse of the wisdom seal, and apply it.</p>
<p>“Awakening should not be forced upon those who do not want it.</p>
<p>Instead, let them arouse the mind of awakening by hearing of the Buddha’s splendor.</p>
<p>When this teaching is applied just as it is explained in the discourse,</p>
<p>They will soon become protectors of the world.</p>
<p>“Those who want to reach the vast and sacred awakening of buddhahood</p>
<p>Should stay in hermitages and devotedly take the vows of individual liberation.</p>
<p>Because of the three vows, they will see all beings like a mother sees her son.</p>
<p>They joyfully honor them and see them as teachers.</p>
<p>“Those who record this absorption of the wisdom seal,</p>
<p>Who hold it, show it, read it, and teach it to others,</p>
<p>Will accrue limitless and unfathomable merit.</p>
<p>Such children of the victorious ones will travel to the world of Sukhāvatī.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva great being Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Venerable Blessed One, in the future, during the final five hundred years,  what will happen to those who receive and hold this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Maitreya, in future times, they will suffer, suffer immensely. They will be false, totally false. They will have little patience or interest, and they will destroy their roots of virtue. Maitreya, even if I were to explain to you how bodhisattvas will be destroyed in the future, Maitreya, you could not comprehend it.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva great being Maitreya beseeched the Blessed One, “Please consider us all compassionately! Blessed One, please teach us! Well-Gone One, please teach us! Blessed One, those bodhisattvas who endeavor to learn, once they hear your teaching, will train in suchness. Once they train in suchness, they will gain accomplishment in suchness. From then on, their progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening will be irreversible. This will be their accomplishment.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One responded to the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, “Maitreya, beings who previously aroused the mind of awakening and engendered roots of virtue in the presence of a hundred buddhas will, in future times, allow the mind of awakening to deteriorate. They will no longer have any interest in the extremely vast, but renounce it.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, even beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of a thousand buddhas will, in future times, no longer have any interest in the extremely vast, but renounce it, even though they aroused the mind of awakening. They will not commit it to writing,  receive it, hold it, teach it, or trust it.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of a hundred thousand buddhas will, in future times, arouse the mind of awakening, feel interest in the extremely vast, and not renounce it. However, they will not proclaim it, and they will not understand its meaning.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of ten million buddhas will, in future times, arouse the mind of awakening, hear about the extremely vast, commit it to writing, retain it, stay interested, proclaim it, and understand its meaning. However, they will not gain acceptance of awakening, will not attain this absorption, and will not gain eloquence.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of a hundred million buddhas will, in future times, arouse the mind of awakening, hear about the extremely vast, feel interested in it, commit it to writing, retain it, proclaim it, and gain acceptance of it. Yet, they will not attain this absorption and will not gain eloquence.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of three hundred million buddhas will, in future times, arouse the mind of awakening, hear about the extremely vast, feel interested in it, not renounce it, trust it, recite it, commit it to writing, read it, and chant it. They will master it, retain it, retain it thoroughly, realize its meaning, and teach it extensively to others. They will train in it, gaining acceptance of awakening. However, they will not attain this absorption of the thus-gone one’s wisdom seal, and they will not gain eloquence.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, beings who have previously aroused the mind of awakening and produced roots of virtue in the presence of eight hundred million buddhas and heard from these buddhas about this absorption that is the wisdom seal of the thus-gone ones, and who grasp it and understand it will, in future times, arouse the mind of awakening, hear about the extremely vast, feel interested in it, trust it, and not renounce it. They will recite it, trust it, chant it, commit it to writing, read it, and master it. They will retain it, retain it thoroughly, realize its meaning, and teach it extensively to others. They will train in it, gaining acceptance of awakening. Furthermore, they will also attain this absorption that is the wisdom seal of the thus-gone ones. They will reveal the awakening of the buddhas by means of the indivisibility and nonapprehension of all phenomena. They will not be swept away by demonic activity. They will not be swept away by the obscurations of phenomena. Whatever negative karma they have accumulated over countless prior lifetimes, in future times, it will all be purified merely by a headache. It will all be purified merely by a moment of worry. It will all be purified merely by criticism. It will all be purified merely by scorn. It will all be purified merely by disparagement. It will all be purified merely by belittlement. It will all be purified merely by their having few possessions. In just one life, everything will be purified.</p>
<p>“Maitreya, in future times, those bodhisattvas who are not discouraged from the mind of awakening, who teach the resolve, and who have resolutely set out for awakening will have thereby venerated countless buddhas.  Maitreya, the negativity accumulated by those bodhisattvas that otherwise leads to the lower realms will, in future times, be purified by ugliness of appearance. It will be purified by lack of refinement. It will be purified by sickness. It will be purified by lack of charisma. It will be purified by birth into a lowly family. It will be purified by birth into an obscure family. It will be purified by birth into a disrespected family. It will be purified by birth into a poor family. It will be purified by being born into a family on the borderlands. It will be purified by birth into a wretched family. It will be purified by birth into a ruined family. It will be purified by birth into a family with wrong view. It will be purified by birth into a family of slaves or barbarians. It will be purified by encounters with unfortunate beings. It will be purified by meetings with ignoble beings. It will be purified by their minds being beset by many sorrows.</p>
<p>“Their karmic obscurations will be purified by experiences of troubles in the kingdom, regions, provinces, towns, cities, villages, countryside, royal palace, and their homes. Their karmic obscurations will be purified by experiences of separation from loved ones, famine, not encountering a teacher, and not being able to continuously listen to the Dharma, as well as by long periods without clothing, food, bedding, medicine, or possessions. They will also be purified by receiving only things of poor quality, or too few things. They will also be purified by admiration of the mediocre, and through lack of interest in those who are excellent. Their karmic obscurations will also be purified by obstacles to persevering in the roots of virtue, meager comprehension, straying concentration, the inability to settle the mind, not achieving the factors of awakening, and failing to comprehend the true meaning of the Dharma. Their obscurations will even be purified by witnessing negative actions in dreams.</p>
<p>“If karmic obscurations afflict them, they will be overcome by the evil Māra.  If the evil Māra overcomes them, they will not understand Māra’s faults. Because they do not fully understand Māra’s faults, those who have possessions will despise those who are without. Those who are handsome will despise those who are not handsome. Those who are lovely will despise those who are not lovely. Those who are delightful to behold will despise those who are not so. The learned will despise the ignorant. Those who are eloquent will despise those who are not so. Those who like giving will despise the stingy. The disciplined will despise those with no restraint. Those with a mere modicum of patience will despise those who are malicious. The diligent will despise the lazy. Those with concentration will despise those who are distracted. Those with insight will despise those with erroneous insight. The skillful will despise the unskillful. No matter what beautiful quality they obtain, they will distort it to despise others. Maitreya, when even those who have previously created roots of virtue in the presence of a hundred buddhas—and who now agree, stand together, and are united—become divided in future times, then how could it not be so for other irresolute beings with wild minds who have not produced any such roots of virtue? Maitreya, in that way, the world will one day become a terrifying place.</p>
<p>“Thus, Maitreya, a bodhisattva such as you must don great and solid armor. You must practice selflessly with the power of patience. You must master the wisdom that engages in the profound Dharma. You must have a view free of any objective reference.  Your mind must be firm, as must your diligence. Your resolve and endeavor must be firm. In future times, you must take up the sacred Dharma. You must uphold the sacred Dharma. You must guard the sacred Dharma. You must delight in making the sacred Dharma endure for a long time. You must engender diligence, remain diligent, and keep others in mind.”</p>
<p>When Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the rest of the sixty incomparable beings, as well as Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon, had listened to the teaching on upholding the sacred Dharma delivered by the Blessed One, they were delighted by the prospect of upholding the sacred Dharma, so they promised the Blessed One, “Blessed One, all of us agree to renounce all deceit and artifice. We renounce all pride, conceit, and arrogance. We eliminate all likes, dislikes, and cravings. We are dedicated to the profound state beyond any objective reference, and we will maintain this awakening of the buddhas—the thus-gone ones—accomplished over the course of countless quintillions of eons. We will protect it. We will teach it extensively to others. Paying no heed to our bodies or lives, we will preserve this awakening of the buddhas.”</p>
<p>Then, in order to instruct them, the Blessed One spoke these verses to Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings, and to Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon:</p>
<p>“Be without deceit, artifice, ego, or rigidity.</p>
<p>Remain mindful, intelligent, and without a home.</p>
<p>Accept the profound and rest without distraction,</p>
<p>And guard the wealth of the ten powers!</p>
<p>“Be honest, artless, without desire, and free from ego;</p>
<p>Delight in absence of grasping, and be totally free from clinging.</p>
<p>Keep to sameness like a path in the open sky.</p>
<p>Practicing like this, you will accomplish this absorption.</p>
<p>“Make your constant aspiration for awakening firm,</p>
<p>And meditate on the profound, as the victorious ones did.</p>
<p>If you disregard all loved ones and acquaintances,</p>
<p>That is the way you attain this precious absorption.</p>
<p>“By equalizing the mind that always likes or dislikes,</p>
<p>By perceiving supreme beings as teachers,</p>
<p>And by delighting in what is delightful,</p>
<p>You will quickly realize this absorption.</p>
<p>“Here are presented a billion paths to the seal of eloquence:</p>
<p>A treasure trove of inexhaustible light.</p>
<p>This is the way to enter wisdom,</p>
<p>As sunlight clears away darkness.</p>
<p>“You must uphold this sūtra,</p>
<p>For it is like the sun, the moon, the stars,</p>
<p>The earth, the snowy mountains,</p>
<p>The lords of the four continents, Śakra, Brahmā, and a healer.</p>
<p>“It purifies the mind and exhausts karma.</p>
<p>It is nectar and it tames the demons.</p>
<p>It is a magical eye that sees the minds of others.</p>
<p>It is a roar that causes realization in all beings.</p>
<p>“It makes you remember billions of eons.</p>
<p>It entirely exhausts all entrapments.</p>
<p>This seal of the buddhas is praised by the well-gone ones.</p>
<p>Awakening is in the hand of the one who holds it.</p>
<p>“One realizes emptiness</p>
<p>According to how one abides in this empty nature.</p>
<p>By abandoning the conceptual thinking</p>
<p>Of both thoughts and concepts, you uphold the Dharma.</p>
<p>“After I pass into nirvāṇa, some people will say</p>
<p>That this teaching should be seen as a dream.</p>
<p>The Dharma that is unarisen and uncreated</p>
<p>Is conceptualized by some according to their own understanding.</p>
<p>“Emptiness is unborn and not created by anyone.</p>
<p>It is not seen, does not come, and does not change place.</p>
<p>So when those who dwell on objective references say ‘We know how to train well in emptiness,’</p>
<p>It is a statement made by thieves of the Dharma.</p>
<p>“It may be said, of those for whom receiving this teaching</p>
<p>Causes tears to well up and all their pores to tingle,</p>
<p>That their progress toward awakening is irreversible,</p>
<p>But they will later be spoken of with multiple insults.</p>
<p>“For the sake of well-being, those from humble households will go forth</p>
<p>After their family wealth has run out,</p>
<p>And find every kind of happiness in this teaching,</p>
<p>And yet they will become hostile toward my offspring.</p>
<p>“Some who long for awakening will go forth in this teaching.</p>
<p>They will speak of awakening, yet not abide in it.</p>
<p>For those not secured in awakening,</p>
<p>It is as distant as the far shore of an ocean.</p>
<p>“They will say, ‘Because we rely on households with wealth and friends,</p>
<p>We genuinely go forth.</p>
<p>We are pure in terms of our conduct and hermitage,</p>
<p>And with respect to our preceptor and friends.’</p>
<p>“Whoever goes forth in my teaching</p>
<p>Stays in worldly life like a lotus stays in water.</p>
<p>Those who persevere in this sūtra in this way</p>
<p>Will preserve my awakening.</p>
<p>“Prāmodyarāja, now that I have taught you this,</p>
<p>Do not train like those with low intelligence!</p>
<p>Attain the qualities of buddhahood in earnest!</p>
<p>Apply yourself to it without concepts!</p>
<p>“Imagine that every person in billions of buddha realms</p>
<p>Were to sow as many seeds</p>
<p>As there are grains of sand in the Ganges,</p>
<p>And that each seed were to grow fruits.</p>
<p>“Imagine next that by skillful means,</p>
<p>All the grains were multiplied by a thousand,</p>
<p>Thus filling up all the infinite realms,</p>
<p>And that the ensuing set were counted as one.</p>
<p>“Imagine then that each such collection</p>
<p>Were multiplied by the previous number of sand grains,</p>
<p>And that all the ten directions</p>
<p>Were filled with that many victorious ones.</p>
<p>“Imagine further that each of those buddhas had that many heads,</p>
<p>And each head had that many tongues,</p>
<p>And each tongue called out praises of this sūtra</p>
<p>For as many eons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>“Such descriptions of this sūtra’s qualities</p>
<p>Would be like a mustard seed compare to Mount Meru,</p>
<p>Like a blade of grass compared to the sky, or like a single drop from the ocean.</p>
<p>Thus, it must be approached in a way that transcends concepts.”</p>
<p>Then Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings, as well as Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon, asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, when we say Dharma, to what does that term refer?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings, and to Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon, “Noble sons, Dharma refers to that which is unchanging and nonconceptual.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what do the terms unchanging and nonconceptual refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unchanging and nonconceptual refer to nonreferential.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does nonreferential refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, nonreferential refers to inexhaustible.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does inexhaustible refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, inexhaustible refers to unborn.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does unborn refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unborn refers to uninterrupted.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does uninterrupted refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, uninterrupted refers to uncollected.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does uncollected refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, uncollected refers to ungraspable.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does ungraspable refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, ungraspable refers to nonabiding.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does nonabiding refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, nonabiding refers to unchanging.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does unchanging refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unchanging refers to uncompounded.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does uncompounded refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, uncompounded refers to unquantifiable.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does unquantifiable refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unquantifiable refers to free from thought.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does free from thought refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, free from thought refers to unknowable.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does unknowable refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unknowable refers to unassembled.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does unassembled refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, unassembled refers to without separation.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does without separation refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, without separation refers to sameness.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does sameness refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, sameness refers to without difference.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does without difference refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, without difference refers to nonabiding.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does nonabiding refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, nonabiding refers to immaterial.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does immaterial refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, immaterial refers to essenceless.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does essenceless refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, essenceless refers to groundless.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, to what does groundless refer?”</p>
<p>“Noble sons, groundless refers to nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings, as well as Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon, inquired of the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if the Dharma has such characteristics, how can it be that the Dharma ever vanishes? What is it that we should protect?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied to Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings, and to Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon,  “Noble sons, what childish ordinary beings perceive to be the Dharma and understand to be the Dharma are conceptual elaborations of the Dharma. Because they conceptually impute and elaborate on the Dharma, they teach it dualistically. Those who teach it dualistically are in conflict with the Dharma. However, noble sons, ultimately we find nothing at all—no Dharma and no conflict with the Dharma.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had explained the meaning to them, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Some say that what is created is compounded,</p>
<p>While others say that it is uncompounded.</p>
<p>However, as both apprehend phenomena, both are concepts.</p>
<p>Such conceptual elaborations are called impure.</p>
<p>“Phenomena are not created by anyone, nor does anything destroy them.</p>
<p>No one sees them, knows them, or is close to them.</p>
<p>Such untenable domains of imputed thought—</p>
<p>All are designated empty.</p>
<p>“The thought that something is empty is untenable,</p>
<p>Because the unarisen is imputed through such concepts.</p>
<p>All concepts are demonic nooses,</p>
<p>And immutability is called the seal of Dharma.</p>
<p>“When they imagine nonexistent things,</p>
<p>The childish are bound by those movements of thought.</p>
<p>All concepts are like echoes,</p>
<p>Yet the childish conceptualize about them dualistically.</p>
<p>“The wise never discover knowledge,</p>
<p>And from the wise no knowledge arises.</p>
<p>It is taught in dependence on the relative;</p>
<p>Yet here, no knowledge or knower is observed.</p>
<p>“If phenomena had essences,</p>
<p>Then, because they perish, their cessation would be nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>If phenomena did abide,</p>
<p>Then nirvāṇa would be completely permanent.</p>
<p>“Childish beings engage in abandonment and attainment.</p>
<p>Childish beings create nirvāṇa, though it has no characteristics.</p>
<p>Those who perceive a self attain the compounded,</p>
<p>While the wise are free from notions of existence and absence.</p>
<p>“Knowing and not knowing are not different.</p>
<p>They are mere conventions and have no core.</p>
<p>Those who engage with constructs and marks</p>
<p>Declare nirvāṇa to be a destruction of entities.</p>
<p>“The mind does not know the essence of mind.</p>
<p>Neither does the essence know the mind.</p>
<p>All phenomena are essentially dreams.</p>
<p>This is what some call the two truths.</p>
<p>“Birth is not real,</p>
<p>Nor does cessation have any reality.</p>
<p>None of the buddhas are subject to birth.</p>
<p>They become real through skillful means.</p>
<p>“The buddhas have not attained any wisdom,</p>
<p>And the Dharma that has been taught—they did not teach at all.</p>
<p>Nobody liberates any beings whatsoever.</p>
<p>In this way the buddhas are unborn buddhas.</p>
<p>“If they had an essence that passed beyond suffering,</p>
<p>The victorious ones would go there together with the hearers.</p>
<p>But solid phenomena do not pass beyond suffering,</p>
<p>And the nonconceptual will never be known.</p>
<p>“Those who do not see beings for what they actually are</p>
<p>Teach beings according to the relative world;</p>
<p>But those who see beings as they actually are</p>
<p>Rest in groundless nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Some say that the aggregates are true.</p>
<p>Some say that existence, cessation, and the path are true.</p>
<p>Although the unborn is a single truth,</p>
<p>Some speak of four truths.</p>
<p>“At the seat of awakening I did not accomplish or see</p>
<p>Even a single truth, so how could there be four?</p>
<p>Thus, many of low intelligence go forth</p>
<p>And destroy my teaching.</p>
<p>“Spiritual practitioners who want to pursue positive qualities</p>
<p>In order to practice this absorption</p>
<p>Should not associate with such wild beings;</p>
<p>Instead, like the rhinoceros, they should stay in solitude.</p>
<p>“This was intended to be practiced</p>
<p>By eight hundred million excellent humans.</p>
<p>The many gods who behold this truth</p>
<p>Guard it day and night.</p>
<p>“Whoever meditates on this absorption, so hard to see,</p>
<p>In that person’s dream the Buddha will appear—</p>
<p>Clear, limitless, and inexhaustible—</p>
<p>And grant them entrance into the gateway of attainment.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to youthful Mañjuśrī, “Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva great beings who wish to realize the buddhas’ awakening should strive in this absorption.  Bodhisattvas who wish to accomplish the excellent marks and signs should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain the powers, the fearlessnesses, great love, and great compassion should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain the buddha eye, the self-arisen state, the excellent buddha realm, the excellent lifespan, and the excellent array should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain the excellent retinue, the excellent form, the excellent bodhisattva name, as well as the excellent hearers should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain illumination, wisdom, dhāraṇī, the conventions of beings’ languages, reason, methods, and gateways should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain skill in entering the path, the perfection of light, the generation of the power of correct understanding, and the generation of the power of conviction should strive in this absorption. Bodhisattvas who wish to attain excellent eloquence, unmistaken view, and the realization of sameness should strive in this absorption.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Because when bodhisattvas strive in this absorption, they attain all these advantageous qualities. And when bodhisattvas have these advantageous qualities, they are called buddhas. They are called guides, leaders, great leaders, teachers, omniscient ones, victorious ones, protectors of the world, self-arisen ones, thus-gone ones, those who practice what they preach,  peerless ones, unequaled ones, and incomparable ones. They are called those who speak supremely, those who speak correctly, those who speak the truth, those who speak at the right time, and those who propound the vinaya. They are called unsurpassed, and they are called the most excellent persons. Why is this? Mañjuśrī, as I rested in this absorption and beheld the thus-gone one Dīpaṃkara, I immediately attained awakening.”</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī then asked, “If you discovered awakening upon seeing the blessed thus-gone one Dīpaṃkara, then, Blessed One, why did you continue to circle in saṃsāra for countless eons?”</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī,” replied the Blessed One, “I was circling in saṃsāra for countless eons in order to perform buddha activities, ripen beings, and accomplish excellent former aspirations. However, Mañjuśrī, all the while I sustained awakening and nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then, in order to explain this meaning more extensively, the Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“With this, you become a leader with boundless and supreme intelligence,</p>
<p>Esteemed by billions of buddhas in the ten directions.</p>
<p>It discloses the methods of a hundred sūtras, beyond imagination and limit.</p>
<p>Applying this sūtra, you will accomplish inexhaustible dhāraṇī.</p>
<p>“This wisdom absorption is surely the gateway to all languages.</p>
<p>It brings realization, liberation, nonattachment, and an end to all clinging.</p>
<p>It is beyond birth, interruption, or basis; it is nirvāṇa, free of afflictions.</p>
<p>It brings power, noble marks and signs, and all the victors’ qualities.</p>
<p>“It purifies all melodious speech and any form of language.</p>
<p>It brings realization, satisfaction, purification, and freedom from clinging.</p>
<p>It knows very well, is beyond any doubt, and exhausts all afflictions.</p>
<p>To practice this discourse is to stand before awakening.</p>
<p>“Apply yourself to this—one-pointedly, directly, and properly.</p>
<p>Do not sleep or be lazy; do not obsess over profit or happiness.</p>
<p>Always be disciplined and free from jealousy, and have a loving mind.</p>
<p>In a state of delight, full of devotion, you will attain this supreme absorption.</p>
<p>“Keep an unbiased, disciplined, honest, and joyous mind.</p>
<p>Have no dwelling or relations; concerning profit and pleasure, be like a lotus in a pond.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, be egoless and dedicated, without craving or deceit.</p>
<p>Then, in the future you will attain this king of supreme dhāraṇīs.</p>
<p>“The trichiliocosm will tremble, and the cymbals of a hundred gods will sound.</p>
<p>From the sky will appear hundreds of ointments, clothing, powders, and victory banners.</p>
<p>Lovely garlands, chokers, earrings, capes, conch shells, anklets, necklaces,</p>
<p>Jewels, pearls, armbands, crowns, and rings will be scattered all around.</p>
<p>“Hosts of gods, goddesses, nāgas, gandharvas, and garuḍas;</p>
<p>Several hundred garuḍa lords, asura lords, male lay practitioners, and monks;</p>
<p>Along with many nuns and female lay practitioners, will all be delighted.</p>
<p>Offering their own clothing and jewelry, they will arouse the mind of awakening.</p>
<p>“When this Dharma is taught, many beings will embark for awakening.</p>
<p>It is impossible to show or calculate how many will become nonregressing.</p>
<p>Those who become tamed as worthy ones will be as infinite as the grains of sand in the Ganges.</p>
<p>To behold the Guide, they will joyfully assemble from hundreds of realms.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One gave this Dharma teaching, countless beings set out for unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening of eight trillion bodhisattvas became irreversible. Six hundred million three hundred thousand bodhisattvas attained this absorption that is the wisdom seal of the thus-gone ones. Innumerable monks, nuns, male and female lay practitioners, and countless other beings attained the state of a worthy one.  All bodhisattvas in all the worlds in the ten directions attained this absorption that is the wisdom seal of the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had given this teaching, the great hearers; Prāmodyarāja, Mañjuśrī, and the other sixty incomparable beings; as well as Maitreya, Siṃhapradyota, and all the other bodhisattva great beings of the fortunate eon up until Avabhāsakara, as well as all the bodhisattva great beings who had gathered from the worlds in the ten directions, the royal queen Śrībhadrā and Suvarṇottamaprabhāsā, the entire retinue, and the whole world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
<p>This completes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “The Absorption of the Thus-Gone One’s Wisdom Seal.”</p>
<p>Translated, edited, and finalized, with revisions made according to the new terminology, by the Indian preceptors Jinamitra, Munivarman, and Dānaśīla, along with the chief editor and translator Bandé Yeshé Dé.</p>
