<h1>In Praise of the Goddess Revatī</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to the Three Jewels. Homage to noble, glorious Vajrapāṇi. Homage to the great goddess Rematī.</p>
<p>The family and characteristics</p>
<p>Of Revatī should be explained:</p>
<p>Your body is made of precious substances—</p>
<p>Your back is Jambu River gold,</p>
<p>Your front is silver,</p>
<p>The surface of your belly is covered in vajra.</p>
<p>Your brothers are Treasure and Treasure Guardian,</p>
<p>Your mother is She Who Goes Everywhere,</p>
<p>Your father is called Vāyu.</p>
<p>Your bloodline is that of Bhagīratha;</p>
<p>You are renowned in the heavens.</p>
<p>namo vajrapāṇisya cili cili bhindi bhindi muñca muñca muñca havalakana svāhā| vajrapāṇīr ajñāpayati svāhā| deva samājñāpayati svāhā| rīṣayaḥ samājñāpayati svāhā|namo ratna trayāya| tadyathā| ruru viṣiṣṭhava dhotsi svāhā||</p>
<p>This completes the dhāraṇī of the great goddess Rematī, the Powerful Lady of the Desire Realm, the Great Mother of Demons.</p>
