<h1>The Dhāraṇī “Surūpa”</h1>
</header>
<p>Obeisance to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>namaḥ surūpāya tathāgatāyārhate samyaksaṃbuddhāya | tadyathā | oṃ suru suru prasuru prasuru tara tara bhara bhara saṃbhara saṃbhara smara smara saṃtarpaya saṃtarpaya sarva­pretānāṃ svāhā |</p>
<p>One should recite this spell seven times over a meal of rice together with water. Then, after having snapped the fingers of the left hand three times, one should offer it in a secluded place to all pretas and say the following: “Off with you, you who seek weak points and are looking for an opportunity! I hereby donate food to pretas residing in every world system!” One should make the donation before one has eaten. The outcome is that the pretas will each be given a bushel of rice.</p>
<p>If one performs it in this way, in each and every rebirth one will never be feeble or poor. Rather, one will possess great might, beauty, a countenance lovely to behold, much wealth, and great enjoyments. One will have a long lifespan, freedom from illness, and will swiftly attain unsurpassed, perfect awakening. After death, one will be reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>Here ends “The Dhāraṇī ‘Surūpa’.”</p>
