<h1>The Dhāraṇī “One Hundred Thousand Ornaments of the Essence of Awakening”</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>The root mantra:</p>
<p>oṁ namo bhagavate vipula­vadana­kāñca­notkṣiptapra­bhāsaketumūr­dhane tathāgatāya arhate samyaksaṃ­buddhāya | namo bhagavate śākyamunaye tathāgatāya samyaksaṃ­buddhāya |</p>
<p>tadyathā | bodhi bodhi | bodhani bodhani | sarva­tathāgata sarva­tathāgatagocari | dhara dhara | hara hara | prahara prahara | mahābodhi­cittadhāre | culu culu | śatara­śmisañcodite | sarva­tathāgatābhiṣikte | guṇi­guṇapate | sarva­buddha­guṇāvabhāse | mili mili | gaganatale | sarva­tathāgatādhi­ṣṭhite | nabhasthale | śame śame | praśame praśame | sarva­pāpam praśame | sarva­pāpaṃ viśodhane | hulu hulu | mahābodhimārga­sampratiṣṭhite | sarva­tathāgata­supra­tiṣṭhite śuddhe svāhā ||</p>
<p>The essence mantra:</p>
<p>oṁ sarva­tathāgatavyava­lokite | jaya jaya svāhā ||</p>
<p>The ancillary essence mantra:</p>
<p>oṁ hulu hulu jayamukhe svāhā ||</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>oṁ vajrāyuṣe svāhā ||</p>
<p>“When a bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā, or any other son of good family or daughter of good family, writes this dhāraṇī down, builds a stūpa, and places it in that stūpa, the building of that single stūpa will equal the building of one hundred thousand stūpas. When offering exquisite flowers, fragrance, garlands, ointments, powders, garments, parasols, banners, pennants, and so forth, one will not just have made offerings to the stūpa alone, but will have offered these articles to the jewel of the Buddha, the jewel of the Dharma, and the jewel of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>“Nanda, I have taught this sūtra, this dhāraṇī, to benefit beings such as those whose merit is weak, who have no faith, who harbor wrong views, who are consumed with doubt, who have committed actions that bring immediate retribution, whose lifespan is short, and who are to be immediately reborn in the hell realms, in animal realms, or in Yama’s realm.</p>
<p>“Nanda, it is said that in the future, at a later time, the majority of householders and monks will neither read this dhāraṇī nor make offerings, and renunciants and householders alike will suffer. This being the case, when one builds a stūpa after making offerings to the Buddha and hearing this dhāraṇī, one will have made eighty-four thousand offerings adorned with the Dharma. Moreover, one’s accumulation of merit will be inexhaustible, and it will be as if one had read and recited The Stem Array. One will enter the mundane and transcendent maṇḍalas.</p>
