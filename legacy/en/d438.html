<h1>Praise to Tārā with Twenty-One Verses of Homage</h1>
</header>
<p>and Their Benefits</p>
<p>Homage to the honored, noble lady Tārā!</p>
<p>Homage to Tārā, swift and gallant,</p>
<p>Whose glance is instantaneous like lightning.</p>
<p>You arose from the heart of the blossoming lotus</p>
<p>That is the face of the lord of the three worlds.</p>
<p>Homage to you whose face resembles</p>
<p>One hundred autumn full moons gathered;</p>
<p>Your brilliant radiance blazes,</p>
<p>Like a thousand clusters of stars.</p>
<p>Homage to you, whose hand is graced</p>
<p>By a golden-blue lotus flower.</p>
<p>You embody generosity, diligence, endurance,</p>
<p>Serenity, patience, and concentration.</p>
<p>Homage to you, whose triumphs are endless,</p>
<p>Jewel on the Tathāgata’s crown.</p>
<p>You are well attended to by the heirs of the victors,</p>
<p>Who have mastered all the perfections.</p>
<p>Homage to Tuttārā, who with hūṁ</p>
<p>Fulfills all wishes to the bounds of space.</p>
<p>You trample the seven worlds underfoot,</p>
<p>And possess the strength to summon all.</p>
<p>Homage to you, praised by Śakra,</p>
<p>Agni, Brahmā, maruts, and Śiva.</p>
<p>The hosts of bhūtas, vetālas, gandharvas,</p>
<p>And yakṣas pay tribute to you.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who with traṭ and phaṭ</p>
<p>Crush the magical devices of other traditions.</p>
<p>With your right leg bent and your left leg extended,</p>
<p>You shine amid flames blazing wildly.</p>
<p>Homage to Turā, the fearsome lady,</p>
<p>Destroyer of the most powerful demons.</p>
<p>With your lotus face and stern frown,</p>
<p>You are the slayer of each and every foe!</p>
<p>Homage to you, whose fingers grace your heart,</p>
<p>Displaying the mudrā of the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>Graced by wheels in all directions,</p>
<p>Your natural radiance overwhelms all.</p>
<p>Homage to you, supremely joyous,</p>
<p>Your splendorous crown spreading garlands of light.</p>
<p>Tuttārā, smiling and laughing,</p>
<p>You bring demons and worlds within your control.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who can summon</p>
<p>The hosts of earthly guardians.</p>
<p>Knitting your quivering brows, with the syllable hūṁ</p>
<p>You deliver from every misfortune.</p>
<p>Homage to you, so brightly adorned,</p>
<p>With a sliver of moon as your crown,</p>
<p>Your locks always graced by Amitābha,</p>
<p>Whose bright light streams forever forth.</p>
<p>Homage to you, seated amid blazing flames</p>
<p>That resemble the fire that ends an eon.</p>
<p>Immersed in joy, your right leg extends, and the left is bent.</p>
<p>Thus, you crush legions of foes.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who on the earth’s surface</p>
<p>Strike your palms and stamp your feet;</p>
<p>The hūṁ that is formed by your frown</p>
<p>Smashes the seven netherworlds to nothing but dust.</p>
<p>Homage to you, blissful, gracious, and tranquil,</p>
<p>Whose domain is the peace of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>In perfect union with svāhā and oṁ,</p>
<p>You lay to waste every terrible evil.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who, immersed in rapture,</p>
<p>Shatter the bodies of all foes.</p>
<p>You shine with the knowledge-syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>As your mantra’s ten syllables are set forth.</p>
<p>Homage to Turā, your feet stomping,</p>
<p>Formed from the seed of the syllable hūṁ.</p>
<p>The mountains of Meru, Mandara, and Vindhya,</p>
<p>And all the three worlds—you cause them to quake.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who hold in your hand</p>
<p>A deer-marked moon like a divine lake.</p>
<p>With tāra uttered twice and then with phaṭ,</p>
<p>You eliminate all poisons.</p>
<p>Homage to you, sovereign of divine hosts,</p>
<p>Served by gods and kinnaras.</p>
<p>Your resplendence, an armor of joy,</p>
<p>Pacifies strife and clears away nightmares.</p>
<p>Homage to you, whose two eyes shine brightly</p>
<p>Like the sun and the moon when it’s full.</p>
<p>Tuttārā, with twice-uttered hara,</p>
<p>You pacify the most intractable ills.</p>
<p>Homage to you, who have the power to pacify,</p>
<p>You display the three true natures.</p>
<p>Turā, supreme lady, you destroy</p>
<p>The hordes of grahas, vetālas, and yakṣas.</p>
<p>This praise by means of the root mantra—</p>
<p>The twenty-one verses of homage</p>
<p>Should be recited in earnest by the wise,</p>
<p>Who are filled with devotion for the goddess.</p>
<p>Recalling it at dusk and also when rising at dawn</p>
<p>Will grant them freedom from every fear.</p>
<p>It will pacify all misdeeds,</p>
<p>And destroy all evil destinies.</p>
<p>Soon they will receive empowerment</p>
<p>From seventy million conquerors.</p>
<p>Beyond this, they shall attain greatness,</p>
<p>And proceed to the ultimate state of buddhahood.</p>
<p>If they recall this praise all dreadful poisons,</p>
<p>Whether natural or manufactured,</p>
<p>Whether eaten or imbibed,</p>
<p>Will be utterly neutralized.</p>
<p>This will dispel the heap of suffering</p>
<p>Inflicted by grahas, infectious diseases, and poisons,</p>
<p>Even in other beings.</p>
<p>If chanted twice, thrice, or seven times,</p>
<p>Those who want children will come to have them,</p>
<p>Those who seek wealth will come to have that,</p>
<p>Each and every wish will be fulfilled,</p>
<p>And obstacles, entirely vanquished, will be no more.</p>
<p>This completes the praise to the Blessed Tārā as spoken by the completely perfect Buddha.</p>
