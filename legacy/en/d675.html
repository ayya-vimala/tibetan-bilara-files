<h1>The Noble Mahāyāna</h1>

<p>Sūtra of Aparimitāyur­jñāna</p>
<p>Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Bhagavān was staying in Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī, with a great saṅgha of bhikṣus comprised of 1,250 bhikṣus, and with a great number of bodhisattva mahāsattvas.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, in the upward direction there is a universe named Aparimita­guṇa­saṃcaya. There, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened buddha Aparimitāyur­jñāna­suviniścita­tejo­rāja resides, and with the wish to sustain life and extend life to its very limit, teaches the Dharma to beings.</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, the lives of humans in this Jambudvīpa are short; their lifespan is no more than a hundred years, and most of them are seen to have premature deaths. Mañjuśrī, those beings who will write out or cause to be written out this Dharma discourse called ‘Uttering the Praise of the Qualities of the Tathāgata Aparimitāyur­jñāna,’ and even those who hear or recite its title only, up to those who write a copy, keep it at home, and offer flowers, perfume, incense, and garlands to it, will, when their lifespan is ending, still be able to live to a hundred years.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, the lifespan of beings who hear the one hundred and eight names of the tathāgata Aparimitāyur­jñāna­suviniścita­tejo­rāja will be lengthened. Those beings whose lifespan is coming to an end, who keep those names, will also  have their lifespan lengthened.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Mañjuśrī, the noble sons or noble daughters who wish to have long lives, and who hear, write, or cause to be written the one hundred and eight names of the tathāgata Aparimitāyur­jñāna, will obtain these qualities and benefits.</p>
<p>oṁnamo bhagavate aparimitāyur­jñāna-suviniścita-tejorājāya tathāgatāya arhate samyak­saṃ­buddhāya | tadyathā | oṁ sarva-saṃskāra-pariśuddha-dharmate gagana-samudgate svabhāva-viśuddhe mahā­naya-pari­vāre svāhā |</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, those who write or cause to be written these one hundred and eight names of the tathāgata, who make a text of them, keep it at home, and recite it, when their lifespan is coming to an end they will still be able to live to a hundred years. When they pass away from this world, they will be reborn in the tathāgata Aparimitāyur­jñāna’s blissful buddha realm named Aparimita­guṇa­saṃcaya.”</p>
<p>oṁ namo bhagavate aparimitāyur­jñāna-suviniścita-tejorājāya tathāgatāya arhate samyak­saṃ­buddhāya | tadyathā | oṁ sarva-saṃskāra-pariśuddha-dharmate gagana-samudgate svabhāva-viśuddhe mahā­naya-pari­vāre svāhā |</p>

<p>Then at that time tens of millions of buddhas, as many as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers, with a single intention and a single voice, uttered this Aparimitāyur­jñāna Sūtra.</p>
<p>oṁ namo bhagavate aparimitāyur­jñāna-suviniścita-tejorājāya tathāgatāya arhate samyak­saṃ­buddhāya | tadyathā | oṁ sarva-saṃskāra-pariśuddha-dharmate gagana-samudgate svabhāva-viśuddhe mahā­naya-pari­vāre svāhā |</p>

<p>oṁ namo bhagavate aparimitāyur­jñāna-suviniścita-tejorājāya tathāgatāya arhate samyak­saṃ­buddhāya | tadyathā | oṁ sarva-saṃskāra-pariśuddha-dharmate gagana-samudgate svabhāva-viśuddhe mahā­naya-pari­vāre svāhā |</p>
<p>This is what the Bhagavān taught, and Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, the complete assembly, and the world with its devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas were delighted and praised the Bhagavān’s words.</p>
<p>The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra of Aparimitāyur­jñāna is concluded.</p>
