<h1>In Praise of the Glorious Goddess Sarasvatī</h1>
</header>
<p>In the path that leads to awakening,</p>
<p>The victors and their heirs, masters of the Dharma,</p>
<p>And the multitudes of wisdom maṇḍalas</p>
<p>Arranged in successive levels of knowing—in these we seek refuge.</p>
<p>Homage to you, glorious goddess Sarasvatī.</p>
<p>Your mastery over speech is renowned throughout the world</p>
<p>And you have transcended the three knowledges of the sages.</p>
<p>All of this is the result of your vast conduct.</p>
<p>You take up the burden of immense activities</p>
<p>And joyfully endure every hardship for the benefit of beings.</p>
<p>Coursing through the levels and the ten perfections,</p>
<p>And standing steadfast in stores of virtue, you take whatever form is needed.</p>
<p>Your rounded face is the flawless moon in full.</p>
<p>Your lustrous eyes of compassion open the eyes of others</p>
<p>As you gaze at length upon every last universe, effortlessly.</p>
<p>It is before you that the likes of Devendra and Brahmā bow down.</p>
<p>Compassionate mother, replete with love and patience,</p>
<p>It is your delight, noble goddess, to nurture every single being.</p>
<p>Your eloquence is lofty and your top-knot rivals mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Your wisdom runs deep as you act in support of knowledge.</p>
<p>Wielding mastery over fields of knowledge, you are the patroness of words.</p>
<p>As you are the god of all gods in the universe,</p>
<p>And a supreme companion who endeavors to dispel our suffering,</p>
<p>Even extremist scholars bow down before you.</p>
<p>Your limbs are well proportioned, and your voice is ever sweet.</p>
<p>Poised with majesty, you glow with flawless qualities and merit.</p>
<p>As it is you who grants the accomplishments of the highest knowledge,</p>
<p>Grant us swift intellect, retention of words, and eloquence most supreme!</p>
<p>With the welfare of every being always in your heart,</p>
<p>Eminent and unfailing goddess, you dwell in liberation.</p>
<p>Firm in your promises, you consider with grace</p>
<p>Those who call upon you, and you fulfill their every wish.</p>
<p>As the master of sound, you capture in words</p>
<p>Everything that appears in the universe.</p>
<p>You are understood by all and skilled in expression.</p>
<p>O Sarasvatī, your capabilities are inconceivable.</p>
<p>Wielding mastery over the might of dhāraṇī and Dharma,</p>
<p>You, a capable ṛṣi, have genuinely mastered the samaya.</p>
<p>Bestowing your blessing on our bodies, minds, and speech,</p>
<p>You work to satisfy the world with your ever-pleasing voice.</p>
<p>You are admired by all for your conduct of supreme awakening.</p>
<p>Blessed Lady, please continue always to grant the supreme purpose</p>
<p>To those who desire the boon of pure body, speech, and mind</p>
<p>With which to bring about the perfect benefit of beings.</p>
<p>Help us to be brave as we strive along the path to awakening.</p>
<p>Let our tongues be quick and our words be righteous.</p>
<p>Endow us with treasuries of knowledge and speech unobstructed.</p>
<p>Allow us to achieve the full eloquence of all the well-gone ones.</p>
<p>Mother of knowledge, your nature is devoid of conceptuality.</p>
<p>The flag of your reputation flutters in the winds of joy.</p>
<p>Like wanting to draw a picture in the sky,</p>
<p>Your attributes are hard to comprehend, your qualities are boundless.</p>
<p>namo bhagavate brahmaṇe | namaḥ sarasvatyai devi siddhyantu mantrapādam brahmānumantra svāhā.</p>
<p>This concludes “In Praise of the Glorious Goddess Sarasvatī.”</p>
