<h1>The Blessed One’s Praise of Sharp Mañjuśrī</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to the Omniscient One!</p>
<p>The Blessed One praised sharp Mañjuśrī:</p>
<p>Your head shines gently with the beauty of midnight splendor.</p>
<p>Your braids sway like a boat amid azure ocean waves.</p>
<p>At the noble crown of your head, the supreme mark, coiled to the right—</p>
<p>An uṣṇīṣa lofty beyond the sight of ordinary beings.</p>
<p>That all suffering of existence be overcome</p>
<p>And your brilliant powers vanquish the enemy,</p>
<p>The crown upon your head conceals a conqueror’s excellence;</p>
<p>Your perfections of might and skill are those of a dharmarāja.</p>
<p>As in cat’s-eye gems and water lilies, so in your eyes,</p>
<p>White and black are distinguished with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>Your elegant eyebrows glisten like crescent moons,</p>
<p>And the sidelong glances of your smiling eyes signal your affection.</p>
<p>You are the foundation of countless Dharma gates to limitless liberation,</p>
<p>In the sundry plethora of the victors’ fields,</p>
<p>Embellished by pure music, excellent qualities, ample grain,</p>
<p>And jewels of every type.</p>
<p>The beautiful form of your nose is noblest of all—</p>
<p>Highly ridged, with corners slight, and elegant of shape,</p>
<p>Finely channeled like a slender stream.</p>
<p>One will not tire of gazing upon its virtues even in a hundred eons.</p>
<p>Your lips, the red of a mañjiṣṭhā flower,</p>
<p>Your exquisite body, perfectly formed, quelling deluded thought,</p>
<p>Your lovely complexion, radiant as a lotus, clear as a lake,</p>
<p>And the lucidity of your mind—all give reason to smile.</p>
<p>Your moon-like countenance is golden and effulgent,</p>
<p>A maṇḍala of light resplendent with golden garlands,</p>
<p>An orb of pure light to outshine a hundred suns,</p>
<p>Emitting many colors like a mass of clouds.</p>
<p>O Gentle Voice, the dharmadhātu you proclaim—</p>
<p>Alluring as the song of the kalaviṅka bird.</p>
<p>Your voice, perfect, pristine, and melodious,</p>
<p>Roars like a lion and chimes like a golden bell.</p>
<p>The body that you cultivate—a body cloaked in noble splendor—</p>
<p>Performs the deeds of the most excellent of beings.</p>
<p>It is youthful in appearance and youthful in bearing,</p>
<p>A youthful form that trains the ready.</p>
<p>You wear a crown replete with many jewels;</p>
<p>Pearls are embedded in your golden necklace.</p>
<p>Layered garments, a divine lotus, envelop you.</p>
<p>In your right you brandish the finest weapon, which tames through skillful means—</p>
<p>It is insight itself, incomparably keen,</p>
<p>Perfectly expressing the dharmadhātu principle,</p>
<p>Incisive in manner, unbreakable as vajra.</p>
<p>In your left is the Perfection of Wisdom,</p>
<p>The inconceivable sphere where nothing is cultivated nor cast aside—</p>
<p>Such is the fathomless dharmatā,</p>
<p>The truth you embrace in your heart.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Blessed One’s Praise of Sharp Mañjuśrī.”</p>
