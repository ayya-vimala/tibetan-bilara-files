<h1>The Root Manual of the Rites of Mañjuśrī</h1>
</header>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Oṁ, homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. Lord Śākyamuni dwelt above the Pure Abode, in an inconceivable, wondrous pavilion, circular in shape, with a congregation of bodhisattvas distributed all around, located in the canopy of the sky. There the Lord addressed the gods of the Pure Abode: {1.1}</p>
<p>“Honored gods! Listen as I tell of the inconceivable, wondrous miracles of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, bodhisattva, and great being—listen as I tell of his conduct, different types of samādhi, and magical power; his liberation, maṇḍala, and his miraculous bodhisattva manifestations; and how he is the sustenance for all beings and brings them life, health, and sovereignty! I will explain, for the benefit of all beings, the mantra subjects that completely fulfill one’s wishes. Listen well and duly reflect upon it—I will now tell you about him.” {1.2}</p>
<p>Thereupon the gods of the Pure Abode, folding their hands, said:</p>
<p>“Then tell us, Lord, about the conduct of the bodhisattvas; their different samādhis and their attainment of the bodhisattva levels; their sitting upon the vajra throne, overpowering of Māra, and turning of the wheel of Dharma; their liberating of all śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas; their ensuring for all beings rebirth as a god or a human and the pacification of all suffering; their removal of diseases of the poor, sick, and wealthy alike; their invulnerability to the use of all mundane and supramundane mantras; and their fulfilling of all wishes that thus makes the speech of all the tathāgatas fruitful. Lord, speak with a mind full of love and concern for our welfare,  and out of pity for all sentient beings.” {1.3}</p>
<p>Then Lord Śākyamuni, casting a glance with his buddha eye over the entire realm of the Pure Abode, entered the samādhi called the spreading and diffusing of the light of the pure sphere. As soon as the Lord entered this samādhi, out of his ūrṇā came an array of light rays called arouser of the bodhisattva Saṃkusumita; he was surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of millions of rays. The light circumambulated the Buddha three times and, having passed through billions of trichiliocosms and crossed as many worlds in the northeastern direction as there are grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, it came to the world sphere called Kusumāvatī, where the tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra was staying. Due to the power of his previous aspirations, Mañjuśrī was also staying there together with other bodhisattvas, great beings engaged in bodhisattva activity. Seeing this effulgence of light, he gently smiled and addressed the multitude of bodhisattvas: {1.4}</p>
<p>“This arousing ray of light, O sons of the victorious ones, has come here to wake me up. Do pay attention!” {1.5}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the bodhisattva, the great being, with his eyes wide and unblinking, sat facing the radiance of the ray. And this arousing ray, illuminating the Kusumāvatī world sphere with great radiance, circumambulated the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra clockwise three times and dissolved into the head of the great being, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. {1.6}</p>
<p>The divine youth Mañjuśrī then got up from his seat  and circumambulated the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra three times. Then, bowing his head and placing his right knee on the ground, he spoke to Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra: {1.7}</p>
<p>“May Lord Śākyamuni, the tathāgata, the arhat, the completely awakened one, think of me. Let me go, O lord, from here to the Sahā world sphere to see Lord Śākyamuni, to honor him and serve him. Let me go so that he may instruct me in the mantra practice, the sādhana practice, and the procedure of constructing the right maṇḍala; the secrets of the ritual and the procedure of drawing the picture; and the secret mudrā empowerment into the heart of all the tathāgatas, so that all the wishes of all beings are fulfilled.” {1.8}</p>
<p>Being so addressed, the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“You may go, divine youth Mañjuśrī, if you think that this is the right time. And please ask Lord Śākyamuni, on my behalf, if he is without pain and without worry, if his efforts come easily to him, and if his life is comfortable.” {1.9}</p>
<p>Then, the thus-gone lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra  further said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Also, O divine youth, the tathāgatas, the arhats, the completely awakened ones, numerous as grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, have taught and will teach again of your proficiency in mantra practice, maṇḍala ritual, the secret empowerment, the mudrās, the picture drawing procedure, the homa rite, the mantra recitation, and the regular observations, all of which fulfill every wish and bring joy to every being. They will teach of your proficiency in the vast fields of astrology and gemology; of your knowledge of the past, present, and future; and of your ability to govern and make predictions. They will teach of your mantra repetition, your ability to travel to the ends of the earth and to become invisible, and your vast knowledge of the right time and occasion for anything. They will teach how to traverse all the stages of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas, and all the mundane and supramundane stages without exception. They will teach the way in which you are established in the practice of all of these. So that I too may rejoice, please go Mañjuśrī, O divine youth, if you think that the time is right. You will hear these teachings in the presence of Śākyamuni, face to face with him, and you will later give them yourself. The mantra for this is as follows: {1.10}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the tathāgatas whose instructions are inconceivable and perfect!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, ra ra! Do remember! O perfect teacher possessing the form of a divine youth! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!{1.11}</p>
<p>“This was, O divine youth Mañjuśrī, the root mantra. It is the heart essence of all the tathāgatas, and it was and will be recited by them. You will also now recite this, the all-accomplishing mantra, together with all its parts, having arrived in the Sahā world. This has been sanctioned by Śākyamuni. Here, the ultimate heart mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, this [mantra] is [my] homage to speech!{1.12}</p>
<p>“The subsidiary heart mantra in this set is:</p>
<p>“Speech, hūṁ!”{1.13}</p>
<p>Lord Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, being thus granted leave by Saṃkusumita Rājendra,  the tathāgata, entered the samādhi called the ornament of all supernal manifestations that brings the attainment of the essence of awakening which is a product of the conduct of a bodhisattva. As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, the world sphere with all its directions—above, below, and across—up to its farthest reaches, became filled with lord buddhas. Saṃkusumita Rājendra then said: {1.14}</p>
<p>“Good, good it is, O son of the Victorious One, that you have entered this particular samādhi! No śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, or bodhisattvas who are established in the perfect conduct, not even those on the tenth bodhisattva level, are able to enter this samādhi.” {1.15}</p>
<p>Then Saṃkusumita Rājendra, having conferred with the lord buddhas, the tathāgatas, taught the following mantra of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth—his ultimately secret, innermost heart essence that accomplishes all purposes. This most secret, divine mantra, called One Syllable, which serves the interests of all beings, is also fit to accomplish the special mantra practice.{1.16}</p>
<p>Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra, the tathāgata, became quiet for a moment. Looking with his buddha eye over all the world spheres, he considered all the lord buddhas dwelling there, and with a mind filled with love, pronounced the mantra:</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas!</p>
<p>“Oṁ maṁ!”</p>
<p>“This mantra is the ultimate heart essence of Mañjuśrī, which accomplishes all endeavors.” {1.17}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, arose from the aforementioned samādhi and performed, in the time that it takes a strong person to bend or to extend their arm, or to snap their fingers, or to close and open their eyes, the miraculous, special samādhi called the intellect with the force of magical power, and went to the Sahā world. Having arrived there, he established himself in the palace of the gods of the Pure Abode founded upon fine jewels and gems in the canopy of the sky. Illuminating this entire realm of the Pure Abode with powerful rays of light, he entered the samādhi called the illuminator adorned with brilliant jewels. {1.18}</p>
<p>As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, he manifested through the power of bodhisattva transformation, for the worship of Lord Śākyamuni, a divinely created palace sumptuously studded with many gems and adorned with jeweled parasols spanning many hundred of thousands of leagues; bedecked with divinely beautiful great bundles of silk streamers; decorated with celestial flowers, banners, flags, garlands, and jewels; and pleasant with the sweet sound of draperies of latticed wind-chimes. Also, in the act of worshiping Lord Śākyamuni, he manifested a copious rain of perfume, garlands, ointments, wreaths, and scented powders. {1.19}</p>
<p>Seeing this extraordinary and marvelous display—a miracle of a bodhisattva—the hair of the gods of the Pure Abode stood on end in excitement. When, however, they saw their abodes trembling, their hearts became tormented and pained. They immediately began to wail loudly, with a sense of great urgency, “Oh, what can this be? Could it be that we are being deprived of our divine powers?” And they implored, “Please protect us, Lord! Please protect us, Śākyamuni!” {1.20}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then addressed the entire assembly of the gods of the Pure Abode:</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, friends! Do not be afraid! Mañjuśrī, the divine youth present here, the bodhisattva, the great being, has come here from the presence of the tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra in the buddhafield Saṃkusumita, in order to see, worship, and serve me. He has come to teach the conduct of great purpose, the mantra subjects, and the vast and amazing Dharma subjects.” {1.21}</p>
<p>The divine youth Mañjuśrī, in turn, circumambulated Lord Śākyamuni three times and, looking at him with unblinking eyes, bowed down to his feet and praised him with these succinct words: {1.22}</p>
<p>“Homage to you, the liberated one not subject to birth!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the best among men!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the elder of men,</p>
<p>Who accomplishes all purposes of [mantra] conduct! {1.23}</p>
<p>“Homage to you, O lion of a man,</p>
<p>Who prevents anything undesirable from occurring!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the great hero</p>
<p>Who eliminates all evil destinies! {1.24}</p>
<p>“Homage to you,  white lotus of a man,</p>
<p>Who is fragrant with the scent of merit!</p>
<p>Homage to you, O lotus of a man,</p>
<p>Who purifies the mire of the three types of existence! {1.25}</p>
<p>“Homage to you, O liberated one,</p>
<p>Who delivers from all pain!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the tranquil one</p>
<p>Who perfectly tames all the untamed ones! {1.26}</p>
<p>“Homage to you, the accomplished one</p>
<p>Who fulfills the purpose of all mantra practice!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the auspicious one,</p>
<p>The most auspicious among all auspicious! {1.27}</p>
<p>“Homage to you, the awakened one</p>
<p>Who awakens others to the complete truth of the Dharma!</p>
<p>Homage to you, the tathāgata,</p>
<p>The one who abides in and teaches</p>
<p>The suchness of all phenomena,</p>
<p>Which is devoid of conceptual elaboration! {1.28}</p>
<p>“Homage to the omniscient one who is established, and is establishing others, in nirvāṇa and in the path of the three vehicles that encompasses all consciousnesses and all knowable objects, both conditioned and unconditioned!” {1.29}</p>
<p>Having praised Lord Śākyamuni in his presence with these words, Mañjuśrī said:</p>
<p>“There is, O lord, in the eastern direction beyond world spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in one hundred thousand Gaṅgā rivers, a buddhafield called Saṃkusumita. There is a world sphere there called Kusumāvatī where the tathāgata Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra dwells. An arhat, one perfectly awakened, perfected in wisdom and conduct, the bliss-gone one, the supreme knower of the world, the guide of people who need to be tamed, the preceptor of gods and men, he expounds the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. He presented an account of the buddha activity that is profoundly meaningful, full of beautiful figures of speech, original, complete, perfectly pure, and highly polished. He is presently living and teaching all sentient beings the Dharma, the bodhisattva basket that pertains to the mantra practice,  the path that conforms to the practice of the threefold path, the protection, the place of rest, the refuge, the highest aim, the well-being, and the ultimate and final cessation. It is by his command that I have arrived here in your presence, to be at your feet. Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra, the tathāgata, asks if you are without pain and without worry, if your efforts come easily to you, and if your life is comfortable. He also said this: {1.30}</p>
<p>“ ‘It is indeed wonderful that in this time of the five degenerations Lord Śākyamuni, the awakened one, has appeared and is giving complete Dharma teachings with nothing missing—the Dharma that consists of the threefold path and that brings about rebirth as a god or a human and final emancipation. Wonderful indeed is Lord Śākyamuni’s courage, that in this world of helpless beings he establishes them on the path that leads to escape from the three realms, and he also establishes them in the state of nirvāṇa, which is complete with boundless spiritual accomplishment and happiness. Is it not true that only the awakened ones can know the minds of the lord buddhas? How could I know how to perform the magical feats of the lord buddhas, whose miracles stem from an inconceivable, wondrous, superhuman power? How could I know of their engagement in the mental and physical conduct that constitutes their potential for the accomplishment of tasks? Would I be able to even summarize these things in hundreds of thousands of millions of eons? The accomplishments of the tathāgatas, and all their forms without exception, whether separate and distinct or altogether, should be seen in terms of unconditioned dharmas. Only you, O Lord, the tathāgata, can explain the conduct and the qualities related to the elimination of traits eliminable through the path of seeing. I cannot do that.’ ” {1.31}</p>
<p>Seated on a great jeweled lotus miraculously created through his own magical power, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth,  watched Lord Śākyamuni with anticipation. The latter, following the usual practice of a tathāgata, first gave by way of introduction the customary manifold preamble preceded by questions from the audience, and then he spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the bodhisattva, the great being, with a voice as sweet as Brahmā’s, a voice that resembled the call of a cuckoo or the resounding of thunder or a drum, a voice that is fitting to a Dharma discourse and causes the bodhisattva to be accomplished: {1.32}</p>
<p>“Welcome to you, Mañjuśrī! The extensive tract of this great manual will now be explained; it has been approved by me and taught by all the buddhas. It is the manual that effects the accomplishment of the conduct of great beings; that is blessed by the buddhas; that achieves the aims of bodhisattvas; that contains the mantra topics together with the secret empowerments, mudrās, maṇḍalas, and empowerment rituals; that brings about long life, lack of illness, and dominion and fulfills all wishes; that contains all the tantras on sādhana rites; that causes one to know all minds and mental objects, the occurrences in all times, all hidden phenomena, and the kingdoms and realms in the past, present, and future—in short, the fulfillment of all the wishes of all beings. This is a mantra practice that facilitates the generation of good qualities and is the cause of the joy of beings. This manual contains instructions on becoming invisible; traveling through space; fast walking; increasing intelligence; the magic of summoning; the ability to visit subterranean paradises; the rites of assault; the obtainment of every sensual pleasure; the power to summon the multitudes of yakṣas and yakṣiṇīs, kiṃkaras, piśācas, and bhūtas; and the power to become a child, an old person, or a youth, as required by circumstances. {1.33}</p>
<p>“In short, this teaching has the power to perform all actions; it fulfills the heart’s every wish, magically manifesting itself in the magic of assault, of enriching, and of pacifying. It will be accomplished exactly according to how it is applied. Please teach now this ornament of the bodhisattva basket, this great, jewel-like, extensive manual,  this treasury of teachings on the mantra practice of pure beings that was sanctioned by me and taught by all the buddhas. Teach it for the benefit and happiness of many beings, gods and humans, with all sentient beings in mind.” {1.34}</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered the bodhisattva samādhi called arousing with an array of light rays the blessing power of all the buddhas. As soon as he, the pure being, entered this samādhi, the light primarily illuminated the world spheres that were as numerous as the grains of sand in many Gaṅgā rivers, as well as all the buddhafields from the Akaniṣṭha heaven to the Avīci hell. Any beings that were experiencing pain attained a peaceful state with their suffering pacified. Having aroused all the śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, bodhisattvas, and lord buddhas, the light again disappeared into the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī’s forehead. Immediately, all the lord buddhas who inhabited the buddhafields in the eastern direction were impelled by the display of the light sphere illuminating everything around. These buddhas were: {1.35}</p>
<p>The tathāgata Jyotis­saumya­gandhāvabhāsa­śrī, the tathāgata Bhaiṣajya­guru­vaiḍūrya­prabha­rāja, the tathāgata Samantāvabhāsa­śrī, the tathāgata Samudgata­rāja, the tathāgata Śālendra­rāja, the tathāgata Lokendra­rāja, the tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rāja, the tathāgata Anantāvabhāsa­rājendra, and the tathāgata Jyoti­raśmirājendra. {1.36}</p>
<p>The lord buddhas headed by those just mentioned,  surrounded by multitudes of bodhisattvas and residing in numberless and infinite world spheres—the tathāgatas, the arhats, the fully awakened ones—all congregated in the Sahā world in the realm of the Pure Abode where Śākyamuni, the tathāgata, the arhat, the fully awakened one, was staying together with Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, and expounding the vast topic of mantras and bodhisattva conduct. {1.37}</p>
<p>So it was also in the southern, western, and northern directions, and in the intermediate directions. The light illuminated there all the buddhafields that lie above, below, and across, and it obscured all the abodes of the māras. All the tathāgatas who were surrounded by multitudes of bodhisattvas and accompanied by congregations of śrāvakas, desiring to see the Pure Abode, the miraculous power of the buddhas, and the greatness of bodhisattvas, and desiring to make the instructions of the tathāgatas—the vast topics of the different types of samādhi produced by the mantra practice—shine unimpeded throughout the world, took their places. They were: {1.38}</p>
<p>Subāhu, Suratna, Suvrata, Sunetra, Surata, Sudharma, Sarvārtha­siddhi, Sarvodgata, Dharmodgata, Ratnodgata, Ratnaśrī, Meruśrī, Acintyaśrī, Prabhākaraśrī, Prabhaśrī, Jyotiśrī, Sarvārthaśrī, Sarvaratnapāṇi, Cūḍāmaṇi, Merudhvajapāṇi, Vairocana­garbha, Ratnagarbha, Jñānagarbha, Sacintyārtha­garbha, Acintyārtha­garbha,  Dharmodgata­garbha, Dhvajaketu, Suketu, Anantaketu, Raśmiketu, Vimalaketu, Aśeṣaketu, Gaganaketu, Ratnaketu, Garjita­ghoṣa­dundubhi­svara­rāja, Anantāvabhāsa­jñāna­rāja, Sarva­tamāndha­kāra­vidhamana­rāja, Sarva­vikiraṇa­bodhi­vidhvaṃsana­rāja, Sarva­caryātiśaya­jñāna­rāja, Lokendra­rāja, Atiśayendra­rāja, Vidhamanarāja, Nirdhūtarāja, Ādityarāja, Abhāva­samudgata­rāja, Svabhāva­samudgata­rāja, Abhāva­svabhāva­samudgata­rāja, Avipakṣitarāja, Svabhāvabha, Puṇyābha, Lokābha, Amitābha, Anantābha, Sunetrābha, Susambhavābha, Arthabhāvābha, Adhṛṣya, Amṛṣya, Akarma, Akaniṣṭha, Amala, Anala, Dyuti, Pati, Mati, Sukha, Sukhanemi, Nimiketu, Ṛkṣa, Divideva, Divya, Nābhi, Bharata, Lokaśānti, Umāriṣṭa, Dundubhi, Siddha, Sita, Ākhyadivya, Duḥprasaha, Durgharṣa, Durālabha, Dūraṅgama, Durāla, Dūrasthita, Ucca, Uccatama, Khadyota, Samantadyota, Adyota, Ṛṣabha, Ābha, Sumanāpa, Sumanas, Mahādeva, Sunirmala, Malānta, Dānta, Sami,  Sūci, Cihna, Śvetadhvaja, Imi, Kimi, Kaniṣṭha, Nikarṣa, Jīva, Sujāta, Dhūmaketu, Dhvajaketu, Śvetaketu, Suketu, Vasuketu, Vasava, Pitāmaha, Pitā, Niṣkakuru, Lokākhya, Sahākhya, Mahākhya, Śreyās, Tejās, Jyotis, Kiṃkara, Samaṃkara, Lokaṃkara, Divaṃkara, Dīpaṃkara, Bhūtāntakara, Sarvārthaṃkara, Siddhaṃkara, Jyotiṃkara, Avabhāsaṃkara, Dundubhisvara, Rutasvara, Susvara, Anantasvara, Ketusvara, Bhūtamuni, Kanakamuni, Krakucchanda, Kāśyapa, Śikhin, Viśvabhuk, Vipaśyin, and Śākyamuni. {1.39}</p>
<p>These and many other lord buddhas, having illuminated the realm of the Pure Abode, sat on their lotus seats. There was also a multitude of bodhisattvas there who arrived in a similar way. They were: {1.40}</p>
<p>Ratnapāṇi, Vajrapāṇi, Supāṇi, Gagaṇapāṇi, Anantapāṇi, Kṣitipāṇi, Ālokapāṇi, Sunirmala, Sukūpa, Prabhūtakūṭa, Maṇikūṭa, Ratnakūṭa, Ratnahastin, Samantahastin, Gandhahastin, Sugati, Vimalagati, Lokagati, Cārugati, Anantagati, Anantakīrti, Sukīrti, Vimalakīrti, Gatikīrti, Amalakīrti, Kīrtikīrti, Nātha,  Anātha, Nāthabhūta, Lokanātha, Samantanātha, Ātreya, Anantatreya, Samantatreya, Maitreya, Sunetreya, Namantreya, Tṛdhatreya, Saphalātreya, Triratnātreya, Triśaraṇātreya, Triyāṇātreya, Visphūrja, Sumanojña, Valgusvara, Dharmeśvara, Abhāveśvara, Samanteśvara, Lokeśvara, Avalokiteśvara, Sulokeśvara, Vilokiteśvara, Lokamaha, Sumaha, Garjiteśvara, Dundubhīśvara, Vitateśvara, Vidhvasteśvara, Suvakṣa, Sumūrti, Sumahat, Yaśovat, Ādityaprabhāva, Prabhaviṣṇu, Someśvara, Soma, Saumya, Anantaśrī, Lokaśrī, Gagana, Gaganāḍhya, Gaganagañja, Kṣiteśvara, Maheśvara, Kṣiti, Kṣitigarbha, Nīvaraṇa, Sarvāvaraṇa, Sarvāvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Samanta­nirmathana, Samantabhadra, Bhadrapāṇi, Sudhana, Susaṃhata, Supuṣya, Sunala, Ākāśa, Ākāśagarbha, Sarvārtha­garbha, Sarvodbhava, Anivartin, Anivartita, Apāyajaha, Avivartita, Avaivarttika, and Sarva­dharmopaccheda.{1.41}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni dwelt with these and other bodhisattvas in the realm of the Pure Abode. There were also other bodhisattva great beings. Some, with female forms, fulfill the purpose of bodhisattva conduct throughout the infinite universe. Some embody the inconceivable magical formulae of mantras and dhāraṇīs with the power to establish the minds of all beings on the path of no return. Some take on the forms of medicinal herbs. Some emulate the ways of different types of beings, entering flocks of birds, yakṣas, rākṣasas, or entities not designated as sentient beings (asattva­saṁkhyāta), such as jewels, mantras, or wish-fulfilling kings of gems.  They act in a manner suitable for taming beings according to their individual capacities and take on the forms most suited to this purpose. The Lord dwelt there with uṣṇīṣa kings who grant proficiency in the Dharma based on perfect realization in accordance with the instructions pertaining to vidyārāja. They cause beings to enter the Tathāgata, Lotus, and Vajra families and all the worldly and supramundane families. They prevent beings from breaking their samaya vows, establish them on the path of the teachings, and keep the lineages of the Three Jewels from breaking up. They were: {1.42}</p>
<p>Uṣṇīṣa, Atyadbhuta, Atyunnata, Sitātapatra, Anantapatra, Śatapatra, Jayoṣṇīṣa, Lokottara, Vijayoṣṇīṣa, Abhyudgatoṣṇīṣa, Kamalaraśmi, Kanakaraśmi, Sitaraśmi, Vyūḍhoṣṇīṣa, Kanakarāśi, Sitarāśi, Tejorāśi, Maṇirāśi, Samanantarāśi, Vikhyātarāśi, Bhūtarāśi, Satyarāśi, Abhāva­svabhāva­rāśi, and Avitatharāśi. {1.43}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni dwelt with these and other uṣṇīṣa kings, who abide in the sphere of phenomena fulfilling the heart aspirations of beings and pursuing the heart essence of all the victorious ones, in the realm of the Pure Abode. It would be impossible to list all of these uṣṇīṣa kings down to the last one, or to describe their greatness, with their inconceivable might and powers, even in hundreds of thousands of millions of eons. Therefore, they are described here only briefly in an abbreviated form. {1.44}</p>
<p>The gathering of vidyārājñīs will now be enumerated:</p>
<p>Ūrṇā, Bhrū, Locanā, Pakṣmā, Śravaṇā, Grīvā, Abhayā, Karuṇā, Maitrī, Kṛpā, Prajñā, Raśmi, Cetanā, Prabhā, Nirmalā, and Dhavalā.{1.45}</p>
<p>Along with the vidyārājñīs, emitted from the infinite and unbounded form of the tathāgatas, there were others, namely:</p>
<p>Tathāgata’s Bowl, Tathāgata’s Dharma Wheel, Tathāgata’s Couch, Tathāgata’s Splendor, Tathāgata’s Speech, Tathāgata’s Lip, Tathāgata’s Thigh, Tathāgata’s Purity, Tathāgata’s Banner, Tathāgata’s Ensign, and Tathāgata’s Sign. {1.46}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni dwelt with these and with other beings—the vidyārājas and vidyārājñīs, the ceṭas and ceṭīs, the dūtas and dūtīs, the yakṣas and yakṣiṇīs, and other sentient and non-sentient beings—uttering tathāgata mantras, created out of the Cloud of Dharma, and distinguishable by their adornments. They were themselves a product of special samādhis, surrounded by enormous retinues of hundreds of thousands of millions, vidyārājas ranking at the top of all the groups of vidyā beings. They also dwelt in the realm of the Pure Abode. Among the vidyārājas belonging to the Lotus family, there were: {1.47}</p>
<p>The lords, Dvādaśabhuja, Ṣaḍbhuja, Caturbhuja, Halāhala, Amoghapāśa, White Hayagrīva, Anantagrīva, Nīlagrīva, Sugrīva, Sukarṇa, Śvetakarṇa, Nīlakaṇṭha, Lokakaṇṭha, Vilokita, Avalokita, Īśvara, Sahasraraśmi, Manas, Manasa, Vikhyātamanasa,  Kamala, Kamalapāṇi, Manoratha, Āśvāsaka, Prahasita, Sukeśa, Keśānta, Nakṣatra, Nakṣatrarāja, Saumya, Sugata, and Damaka. {1.48}</p>
<p>He dwelt with these and with other vidyārājas, headed by Abjoṣṇīṣa, who had attained the samādhis arising from the infinite accomplishment, the Cloud of Dharma, and who were surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyās and many vidyārājñīs created through the form-samādhi of the lord of the world. These vidyārājñīs were: {1.49}</p>
<p>Tārā, Sutārā, Naṭī, Bhṛkuṭī, Anantaṭī, Lokaṭī, Bhūmiprāpaṭī, Vimalaṭī, Sitā, Śvetā, Mahāśvetā, Pāṇḍaravāsinī, Lokavāsinī, Vimalavāsinī, Abjavāsinī, Daśabalavāsinī, Yaśovatī, Bhogavatī, Mahābhogavatī, Ulūkā, Alūkā, Amalāntakarī, Vimalāntakarī, Samantāntakarī, Duḥkhāntakarī, Bhūtāntakarī, Śriyā, Mahāśriyā, Stupaśriyā, Anantaśriyā, Lokaśriyā, Vikhyātaśriyā, Lokamātā, Samantamātā, Buddhamātā, Bhaginī, Bhāgīrathī, Surathī, Rathavatī, Nāgadantā, Damanī, Bhūtavatī, Amitā, Āvalī, Bhogāvalī, Ākarṣaṇī, Adbhutā, Raśmī, Surasā, Suravatī, Pramodā, Dyutivatī,  Taṭī, Samantataṭī, Jyotsnā, Somā, Somāvatī, Māyūrī, Mahāmāyūrī, Dhanavatī, Dhanandadā, Suravatī, Lokavatī, Arciṣmatī, Bṛhannalā, Bṛhantā, Sughoṣā, Sunandā, Vasudā, Lakṣmī, Lakṣmīvatī, Rogāntikā, Sarva­vyādhi­cikitsanī, Asamā, Devī, Khyātikarī, Vaśakarī, Kṣiprakarī, Kṣemadā, Maṅgalā, Maṅgalāvahā, Candrā, Sucandrā, and Candrāvatī. {1.50}</p>
<p>These and other vidyārājñīs, headed by Parṇaśavarī, Jāṅgulī, and Mānasī, whose accomplishment is limitless, who have the nature of the space of the sphere of phenomena, and whose mental states arise due to the presence of the bodhisattva conduct and marvels—the dūtas and dūtīs, ceṭas and ceṭīs, kiṃkaras and kiṃkarīs, yakṣas and yakṣiṇīs, rākṣasas and rākṣasīs, and piśācas and piśācīs who have taken the samaya vows of the Lotus family and perform the mantra practice—also dwelt in the gods’ realm of the Pure Abode inhabited by pure beings. Staying there, they remained wholly preoccupied with acts of worship of Lord Śākyamuni. {1.51}</p>
<p>In Lord Śākyamuni’s presence, the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi then summoned his own retinue of vidyās, saying, “Please gather here, venerable friends—hosts of vidyās of my retinue—krodharājas,vidyārājas and vidyārājñīs, and great dūtīs!” Then, merely by the power of thought, all the multitudes of vidyā beings were gathered. The male vidyā beings were: {1.52}</p>

<p>These and other vidyārājas and mahākrodhas who completely tame all beings; who perform the activities of banishing, dispersing, killing, and destroying; who are generous toward worshipers; and who engage in the awakened activities of pacifying, enrichment, and assault, themselves surrounded by their own retinues of hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyārājas, bowed, in anticipation of orders, to their vidyārāja Vajrapāṇi, who, for his part, was intently observing Lord Śākyamuni and the divine youth Mañjuśrī. All these vidyārājas sat down on their seats in the places assigned to them according to their buddha family affiliation. {1.54}</p>
<p>Also the great dūtīs, the messengers of Lord Vajrapāṇi, together with their retinues of thousands of millions of vidyārājñīs, abiding nonconceptually in their own sphere of phenomena that has the nature of the sky, gathered in that place. They were: {1.55}</p>

<p>These and other great dūtīs, surrounded by retinues of many other dūtīs, were all gathered in that great assembly. There were also many dhāraṇī goddesses who arise in the mind absorbed in samādhi, and who let their chastising sticks fall upon wicked beings to control them. They were: {1.57}</p>
<p>Vajrānala­pramohanī­dhāraṇī, Meru­śikhara­kūṭāgārādhāraṇī,  Ratna­śikhara­kūṭāgāra­dharaṇiṃdharā, Sukūṭā, Bahukūṭā, Puṣpakūṭā, Daṇḍadhāriṇī, Nigrahadhāraṇī, Ākarṣaṇa­dhāriṇī, Keyūrā, Keyūravatī, Dhvajāgra­keyūrā, Ratnā, Ratnāgrakeyūrā, Lokāgrakeyūrā, Patāgrakeyūrā, Triparivartā, Lokāvartā, Sahasrāvartā, Vivasvatāvartā, Sarva­bhūtāvartā, Ketuvatī, Ratnavatī, Maṇiratnacūḍā, Bodhyaṅgā, Balavatī,Anantaketu, Samantaketu, Ratnaketu, Vikhyātaketu, Sarvabhūtaketu, Ajiravatī, Asvarā, Sunirmalā, Ṣaṇmukhā, Vimalā, and Lokākhyā. {1.58}</p>
<p>These and other dhāraṇī goddesses, surrounded by retinues of many hundreds of thousands of millions of such dhāraṇīs, all gathered in this great assembly. Through the infinite blessing of the buddhas, and the great blessing of the samādhi of the bodhisattvas, there assembled in this great gathering also venerable pratyeka­buddhas from other buddhafields where there are no tathāgatas present. Among them were both the solitary, rhinoceros-like ones and those who move among people, working for the benefit of beings. They demonstrate the way of the Dharma that involves habituation to silence. However, as their mindstreams are devoid of great compassion, they circle in saṃsāra with their minds ever weary. Their minds brim over with habitual thought patterns, and thus their previously generated bodhicitta is also tainted by habitual thinking. Their minds thus stall in progress when they reach the first, second, third . . . or any bodhisattva level up to the eighth, and they are fearful of saṃsāra, with minds ever weary.  They were: {1.59}</p>

<p>Lord Śākyamuni dwelt with these and other hundreds of thousands of millions of pratyeka­buddhas who had entered and were established in what is taught as the “middling vehicle,” which, unconditioned and free from mental elaboration, corresponds in nature to the sky-like sphere of phenomena, which is inconceivable, unmatched, and free of aim—the pratyeka­buddhas who are basically free from attachment and anger. There was also a great congregation of śrāvakas who, in turn,  were accompanied by many hundreds of thousands of millions of śrāvakas. They were: {1.61}</p>

<p>Lord Śākyamuni dwelt with these and many other śrāvakas who knew the taste of infinite freedom in the sphere of phenomena. Out of the collection of the three vehicles, they had reached the lesser one. Fleeing saṃsāra, they had immersed themselves in the contemplation of the triple liberation. They were endowed with the deportment of the four immeasurable thoughts. They focused single-mindedly, became properly ordained, and followed the correct conduct. Having adopted the right system (sunaya), they attained the state of nirvāṇa with its mental tranquility and freedom from mental elaboration. They too were seated in this great assembly along with Lord Śākyamuni and the others, established on the tenth level, who constitute the Three Jewels. {1.63}</p>
<p>Together with them there were many female śrāvakas. Relying on the path of the unconditioned, they abided in the state of nirvāṇa—the attainment of śrāvakas. Pure and free from desire, they developed halos of light. They were all objects worthy of veneration, being repositories of good qualities who facilitate purification. The best among the multitude of beings, they were the foremost leaders of the world.  They were objects of worship of gods and humans and were their fields of merit. They were the supreme leaders of two-legged, four-legged, multi-legged, and legless beings. They were: {1.64}</p>
<p>Yaśodharā, Yaśodā, Mahāprajāpatī, Prajāpatī, Sujātā, Nandā, Sthūlanandā, Sunandā, Dhyāyinī, Sundarī, Anantā, Viśākhā, Manorathā, Jayavatī, Vīrā, Upavīrā, Devatā, Sudevatā, Āśritā, Śriyā, Pravarā, Pramuditā, Priyaṃvadā, Rohiṇī, Dhṛtarāṣṭrā, Dhṛtā, Svāmikā, Sampadā, Vapuṣā, Śrāddhā, Premā, Jaṭā, Upajaṭā, Samantajaṭā, Bhavāntikā, Bhāvatī, Manojavā, Keśavā, Viṣṇulā, Viṣṇuvatī, Sumanā, Bahumatā, Śreyasī, Duḥkhāntā, Karmadā, Karmaphalā, Vijayavatī, Jayavatī, Vāsavā, Vasudā, Dharmadā, Narmadā, Nāmrā, Sunāmrā, Kīrtivatī, Manovatī, Prahasitā, Tribhavāntā, Trimalāntā, Duḥkhaśāmikā, Nirviṇṇā, Trivarṇā, Padmavarṇā, Padmāvatī, Padmaprabhā, Padumā, Padumāvatī, Triparṇā, Saptaparṇā, and Utpalaparṇā. {1.65}</p>
<p>These and other of the most senior of the great female śrāvakas approached in order to salute the Lord’s feet. Desiring to swell the ranks of this great gathering, which was a great miraculous feat of the bodhisattvas, they congregated and took their seats. They were eager to hear the Lord’s teaching and to become a shining example to demonstrate the accomplishment of mantra practice. {1.66}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then looked at this entire gathering and, knowing with his pure heart that the realm of beings extends beyond the three times and is sky-like in nature, without independent existence, he addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows: {1.67}</p>
<p>“Please focus your attention, Mañjuśrī, on the acts that serve the interests of beings! Enter now the bodhisattva samādhi that will delight them according to their wishes, that is accompanied by faith in karmic results, and that will fulfill the purpose of their mantra practice; the samādhi that is the seat of the Dharma, the seat of right action, and the seat of tranquility and liberation; the samādhi that accomplishes ritual procedures and brings a state of equipoise free of all conceptuality; the bodhisattva samādhi that is endowed with the complete power of the ten powers of the tathāgatas and overwhelms the power of Māra.” {1.68}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, then entered the samādhi that was just described by the Lord. As soon as he entered it, he illuminated with a great light and caused to shake great trichiliocosms equal in number to the minute dust particles in many hundreds of thousands of world spheres, similar to this trichiliocosm of ours. He also displayed the use of magical powers, and then pronounced the words of his own mantra: {1.69}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas who arise out of the nature of nonexistence of individual entities! Homage to the pratyeka­buddhas and the noble śrāvakas! Homage to the bodhisattvas, the lords established on the ten levels, the great beings! This is the mantra proper: {1.70}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, kha kha! Devour, devour! O tamer of evil beings, with a sword, a club, an axe, and a noose in your hands! One with four arms, four faces, and six feet, go, go! O great destroyer of obstacles with contorted face, inspiring fear in all nonhuman beings! One who roars with wild laughter and wears a tiger skin, perform, perform all tasks! Cut, cut all the mantras [of non-believers]! Break, break all the mudrās of non-believers! Draw here, draw here all nonhuman beings! Grind, grind all the wicked ones! Cause them to enter into the center of the maṇḍala! O terminator of the life of Vaivasvata, perform, perform tasks for me! Burn, burn! Cook, cook! Do not delay, do not delay! Remember your samaya pledge! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Split, split! Fulfiller of all wishes! Hey, hey, blessed one! Why do you tarry? Accomplish all my aims! Svāhā!{1.71}</p>
<p>This mantra of Lord Mañjuśrī, called Yamāntaka, Great Lord of Wrath, will crush or summon even the king Yama, not to mention ordinary beings. As soon as the Great Lord of Wrath is pronounced, all beings will come into Lord Mañjuśrī’s presence, unhappy, frightened, and terrified, their minds disturbed and their spirits broken, without any other refuge, no other protection or recourse apart from Lord Buddha and the divine youth Mañjuśrī. {1.72}</p>
<p>Any beings that live on dry land, or in water, or fly in the sky, the mobile and the immobile, those enumerated as born from a womb, from an egg, from moisture, or as born spontaneously, those that are situated in the infinite world spheres up to their farthest reaches, and those that are hidden in the cardinal and intermediate directions, above, across, and below will be removed at that very moment from those places by the Great Lord of Wrath himself and brought into the presence of Mañjuśrī. The Lord of Wrath must not be pronounced in the presence of those whose desires have not been extinguished, for they also would wither and die. It should be recited by those who keep their samaya pledges, in front of a buddha image, or a caitya containing relics, or a book containing a genuine Dharma teaching, or in front of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. It must not be recited for the sake of performing other acts in just any place, otherwise terrible omens and great ruin will come to the reciter. {1.73}</p>
<p>For the lord buddhas are indeed filled with utmost compassion, and the bodhisattvas, the great beings, exclusively strive to establish beings in the practice of the insight of omniscient knowledge; enthralling all beings, they establish them in the way of the Dharma. They deliver into nirvāṇa the entire realm of sentient beings; they give instructions and establish beings on the triple path; they prevent breaks in the lineages of the Three Jewels; they illuminate the mantra practice. With minds born of the power of great compassion, they obliterate the power of Māra. They destroy obstacle makers and keep the lords of evil in check. They increase their own power and hold back the power of opponents. They perform the acts of paralyzing, killing, destroying, chastising, burning, and gratifying. They teach the practice of their own mantra. They cause the lifespan, health, and power of beings to increase. They swiftly accomplish all tasks. They readily assume the modes of great love, great compassion, great equanimity, and great sympathetic joy. That is why the Yamāntaka mantra was now recited with a mind free from all doubt and deliberation. Summoned by the mantra were: {1.74}</p>

<p>These and other great yakṣa generals, surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of millions of yakṣas, gathered together through the blessing and magical power of the bodhisattva, in that great assembly in the realm of the Pure Abode. Having assembled, they took their seats in order to listen to the Dharma. Also, the great kings of the rākṣasas, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of millions of rākṣasas, had been brought by the Great Lord of Wrath. They were: {1.76}</p>

<p>The Sahāmpati Brahmās, the Great Brahmās, the gods from the heavens of Ābhāsvara, Prabhāsvara, Śuddhābha, Puṇyābha, Avṛha, Atapas, Akaniṣṭha, Sukaniṣṭha, Lokaniṣṭha, Ākiñcanya, Naivakiñcanya, Ākāśānantya, Naivākāśānantya, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, Sunirmita, Paranirmita, Śuddhāvāsa, Tuṣita, and Yāma; the gods from the realm of the Thirty-Three and from the realm of the four great kings; the gods from the heavens of Sadāmatta, Mālādhāra, Karoṭapāṇi, and Vīṇātṛtīyaka; the gods who dwell in mountains, on mountaintops, and on mountain peaks; those dwelling in Alaka, those who dwell in palaces and mansions, those who dwell in the sky, those who dwell on the earth, those who dwell in trees, and those who dwell in houses. {1.91}</p>
<p>Also came the kings of the dānavas, headed by Prahlāda, Balin, Rāhu, Vemacitri, Sucitri, Kṣemacitri, Devacitri, Rāhu, and Bāhu. {1.92}</p>
<p>They had retinues of many hundreds of thousands of asuras—titans with  extravagant habits, great and varied wealth, and a predilection to engage the gods in battle. Because of the bodhisattva’s blessing, they also joined this great assembly in order to witness, pay respect to, and attend this miraculous bodhisattvic event. In addition, there were also the grahas and the great grahas who work for the benefit of mankind and who dwell in the sky. They were: {1.93}</p>

<p>These great grahas too, along with retinues of many of hundreds of thousands of grahas, were in this great assembly. They gathered together in the great assembly in the realm of the Pure Abode by the blessing of the Buddha and took their seats. Also, the nakṣatras, who move across the sky in the manner of birds, along with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of nakṣatras, were present there. They were: {1.95}</p>

<p>These great rāśis, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of rāśis, came to this great gathering in the realm of the Pure Abode. Having arrived, they bowed to the Lord’s feet and sat down in their respective seats. Also, the great yakṣiṇīs, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of yakṣiṇīs, were present there. They were: {1.99}</p>
<p>Sulocanā, Subhrū, Sukeśā, Susvarā, Sumatī, Vasumatī, Citrākṣī,  Pūrāṃśā, Guhyakā, Suguhyakā, Mekhalā, Sumekhalā, Padmoccā, Abhayā, Abhayadā, Jayā, Vijayā, Revatikā, Keśinī, Keśāntā, Anilā, Manoharā, Manovatī, Kusumā,Kusumāvatī, Kusuma­pura­vāsinī, Piṅgalā, Hārītī, Vīramatī, Vīrā, Suvīrā, Sughorā, Ghoravatī, Surasundarī, Surasā, Guhyottarī, Vaṭavāsinī, Aśokā, Andhārasundarī, Ālokasundarī, Prabhāvatī, Atiśayavatī, Rūpavatī, Surūpā, Asitā, Saumyā, Kāṇā, Menā, Nandinī, Upanandinī, and Lokottarā. {1.100}</p>
<p>These great yakṣiṇīs, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of yakṣiṇīs, bowing to Lord Śākyamuni from a distance, were present in this great gathering. Also the great piśācīs, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of piśācīs, joined in, paying respects to Lord Śākyamuni. They were: {1.101}</p>
<p>Maṇḍitikā, Pāṃsupiśācī, Raudrapiśācī, Ulkāpiśācī, Jvālāpiśācī, Bhasmodgirā, Piśitāśinī, Durdharā, Bhrāmarī, Mohanī, Tarjanī, Rohiṇikā, Govāhiṇikā, Lokāntikā, Bhasmāntikā, Pīluvatī, Bahulavatī, Bahulā, Durdāntā, Elā, Cihnitikā, Dhūmāntikā, Dhūmā, and Sudhūmā.{1.102}</p>
<p>These great piśācīs, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of piśācīs, also entered this great gathering. Also, the mātṛs and the great mātṛs,  who wander throughout the world harming living beings and seizing oblatory offerings of food and garlands, joined in. They were: {1.103}</p>
<p>Brahmāṇī, Māheśvarī, Vaiṣṇavī, Kaumārī, Cāmuṇḍā, Vārāhī, Aindrī, Yāmyā, Āgneyā, Vaivasvatī, Lokāntakarī, Vāruṇī, Aiśānī, Vāyavyā, Paraprāṇaharā, Mukhamaṇḍitikā, Śakunī, Mahāśakunī, Pūtanā, Kaṭapūtanā, and Skandā. {1.104}</p>
<p>These great mātṛs, with retinues of many hundreds of thousands of mātṛs, were present in this great assembly, calling out, “Homage to the Buddha!” {1.105}</p>
<p>Similarly, the entire expanse of space with its many hundreds of thousands of beings, both human and nonhuman, sentient and non-sentient, from the great hell of Avīci to the pinnacle of saṃsāra, became open and accessible to sight. Within the totality of beings there was not a single one who would be in disharmony with another. By the blessing of the Buddha enriched with the magical power of the bodhisattvas, all these beings then saw Lord Buddha and the divine youth Mañjuśrī seated on the crowns of their heads. {1.106}</p>
<p>Now, Lord Śākyamuni, having looked over this entire assembly with his buddha eye, said to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, “Please speak, O pure being! Give a full presentation of the section on samādhi that explains the meaning of mantra practice. Present this basket of bodhisattva teachings if you think that the moment is right.” {1.107}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, with the approval of Lord Śākyamuni, entered the samādhi called the ornament of a contiguous formationsolid as fused vajras, adorned with miraculous displaysof the space-like nature. As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, he blessed the realm of the Pure Abode, which extended over many hundreds of thousands of leagues, so that it became made of vajras. All the many yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, mārutas, and piśācas—in short, the entire universe inhabited by living beings—became situated by the blessing of the bodhisattvas in this great palace that resembled diamond jewels and gems, and there took their seats together, without any mutual enmity. {1.108}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, seeing that this great assembly had gathered, said to Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, “Ho, ho, Great Lord of Wrath, who emanates from all the buddhas and bodhisattvas! Please protect this great gathering! Protect and enthrall it! Tame the wicked ones! Awaken the gentle ones into realization! Placate the implacable ones! As long as I am teaching this bodhisattva basket that accords with my own mantra practice and contains the extensive instructions on mantra practice and the maṇḍala, please go outside and guard this gathering.” {1.109}</p>
<p>Thus addressed, the Great Lord of Wrath, of extremely ugly, misshapen appearance, acknowledged the command and went outside in order to protect all the beings and to train the assembled audience in every respect. Letting out a terrible roar into the four directions, above, below, and across, he took up his position in the form of Yamāntaka Lord of Wrath, with a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of wrathful deities. Thus all beings, having become peaceful and content, did not transgress his orders. They also heard these words: “Those who would disobey this injunction, their heads will split into one hundred parts  like a garland made of basil plants. For such is the power of the bodhisattvic blessing. {1.110}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī then gave a Dharma teaching on the practice of his mantra.</p>
<p>“When a bodhisattva, a great being, possesses a single quality, his mantras become effective. What is this single quality? It is the mind that beholds all phenomena without mentally elaborating upon them. {1.111}</p>
<p>“When a bodhisattva, a great being, possesses two qualities, his mantras become effective. What are these two? They are (1) never abandoning bodhicitta, and (2) having equanimity toward all sentient beings. {1.112}</p>
<p>“With three qualities, his exposition of the meaning of mantra practice will be perfect. What are these three? They are (1) never abandoning any sentient being, (2) guarding the vows of the bodhisattva’s discipline, and (3) never abandoning his mantra. {1.113}</p>
<p>“When a bodhisattva, who has made the initial resolution of a bodhisattva, possesses four qualities, his mantras become effective. What are these four? They are (1) never abandoning his mantra, (2) not neutralizing the mantras of others, (3) generating loving kindness for all sentient beings, and (4) suffusing his mindstream with compassion. The mantras of a bodhisattva who has made an initial resolution and possesses these four qualities become effective. {1.114}</p>
<p>“Five qualities will bring the bodhisattva’s mastery of his mantra practice and his engagement in the basket of teachings to perfection. What are these five? They are (1) frequenting solitary places, (2) frequenting remote, peaceful places, (3) not hating others, (4) not considering employing mundane mantras, and (5) establishing others in discipline, learning, and good character. These five qualities  will completely fulfill the purpose of his mantra practice. {1.115}</p>
<p>“Six qualities will completely fulfill the purpose of mantra practice. What are these six? They are (1) not giving up faith in the Three Jewels, (2) not giving up faith in the bodhisattvas, (3) praising both mundane and supramundane mantras, (4) perceiving the sphere of phenomena that is free of elaboration, (5) not rejecting the sūtras of the Great Vehicle that contain profound words and meaning, (6) never losing heart, (7) pursuing the mantra practice, and (8) not letting virtue decline. These six qualities will bring complete success in the practice of mantra and the knowledge of vidyās. {1.116}</p>
<p>“There are seven qualities that lead to the taking up of mantra practice that are helpful at the time of the actual application of magical vidyās. What are these seven? They are (1) taking up the profound path by cultivating the perfection of wisdom; (2) resolving upon the bodhisattva conduct that consists in reciting, teaching, studying, and writing; (3) taking up the right demeanor, thoughts, recollections, and the holding on to insight, without being impeded by time, place, ritual injunctions, mantra recitation, homa offerings, vows of silence, or the practice of austerities; (4) entering the way of the deep teachings of the Great Vehicle through the two accumulations of a bodhisattva; (5) skill in the procedures of summoning the mantra deities of one’s own lineage or in effecting protection; (6) cultivating great compassion, great loving kindness, great equanimity, and great sympathetic joy, as well as the six perfections; (7) pursuing the two types of omniscient wisdom by bringing together the sphere of sentient beings, the sphere of phenomena, and ‘suchness’ through nonconceptuality; (8) never abandoning any sentient being; and (9) not seeking the Lesser Vehicle. These seven qualities lead to the perfect mastery of mantras and magical knowledge. {1.117}</p>
<p>“Eight qualities will completely fulfill the purpose of the practice of mantra and magical vidyās. What are these eight? They are (1) faith in karmic results, both seen and unseen; (2) refraining from investigating anything out of mere curiosity or the desire to know; (3) displaying magical powers made effective through the grace of a bodhisattva; (4) out of respect for the teacher, learning from him the undistorted mantras; (5) taking to heart the master’s instructions on the buddhas and bodhisattvas’ own mantra system; (6) keeping one’s word; (7) renouncing all of one’s possessions; (8) being able to skillfully explain the signs received in one’s sleep about suitable and unsuitable places for gaining accomplishment; (9) freeing oneself from all stains of stinginess, sleepiness, and dullness, and constantly practicing diligence; and (11) always offering oneself to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. In short, never being complacent about accumulating the roots of virtue, donning great armor, or desiring to remove all obstacles, one will ascend the seat of awakening and experience great bliss as anticipated. One will be known as a great being and will also fall in with other great beings. One will never be separated from a spiritual friend and will be accompanied by Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the bodhisattva. The aforementioned eight qualities will completely fulfill the purpose of mantra practice. {1.118}</p>
<p>“Friends! To sum up, a person who is not separated from bodhicitta, who is devoted to the Three Jewels, who continually exerts himself with unwearied mind even if he were of extremely bad disposition, will succeed in the infinite and marvelous mantra practice of a bodhisattva as taught in the detailed chapter on my mantra, and will develop the mind that arises from this practice. It should not be known to be otherwise. Once someone has become free from dualistic thinking, he will succeed even if his original motive was mere curiosity.” {1.119}</p>
<p>Then, the entire gathering, graced with the presence of buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and venerable śrāvakas, said these words: {1.120}</p>
<p>“Good! It is good, O son of the victorious ones! This Dharma discourse, which leads beings to enter an illustrious Dharma path whose special purpose is mantra practice, has been well presented for the benefit of all beings. O divine youth Mañjuśrī, this talk that is in accord with mantra practice and complies with the requirements of a fine Dharma discourse has been eloquently presented. If any king has this chapter, which records the coming together of the audience, retold, or causes it to be memorized or reflected upon, or if, before a battle, he has it mounted on an elephant and worshiped with various flowers, incense, scents, and ointments, there we will also be present. We will bring his opponents and enemies under control, and we will destroy the armies that oppose him. Or, if anyone keeps it in their house written in the form of a book, we will grant to that son or daughter of the Buddha family—be they a king or a queen, a monk or a nun, or a male or female lay practitioner—protection, prosperity, long life, life free from disease, and the continuous increase of good fortune.” {1.121}</p>
<p>Having said this, the great assembly fell silent. {1.122}</p>
<p>This concludes the first chapter, describing the coming together of the audience, from this great root manual containing an exposition of the mantra practices of the Great Vehicle, an extensive textbook that is a miraculous bodhisattva display of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth.</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Now Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, gazing at this entire assembly,  entered the samādhi called the gaze that causes all sentient beings to take up the samaya pledge. As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, a ray of light issued from his navel. Along with many hundreds of thousands of millions of other rays, it entirely illuminated all the realms of sentient beings and, reflecting back onto the realm of the Pure Abode, suffused it with light. {2.1}</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the great being, addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Please teach, O son of the victorious ones, the full chapter on the maṇḍala called Establishing All Beings in the Samaya, which concerns the accomplishment of the practice that is common to all beings. Having taken up this practice, beings will accomplish your collection of mantras, in addition to accomplishing all mundane and supramundane mantras.” {2.2}</p>
<p>Being thus requested by the lord of guhyakas and yakṣas, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, taught the most secret system of the maṇḍala. He displayed the magical feat called impelling all the vidyā beings. Raising his right hand, he drew the attention of the assembled congregation by using the tip of his finger, from which emerged many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyādhara kings. Upon emerging, they illuminated the entire realm of the Pure Abode with great light and remained there. {2.3}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, then pronounced the heart mantra of Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, a sole hero suitable for all activities. This mantra effects summoning, dismissing, pacifying, enriching, and assaulting. It bestows the ability to become invisible, travel through space, enter subterranean paradises, and walk with great speed. It can be used for the activities of bringing beings into one’s presence, sowing enmity among them or enthralling them, and obtaining all kinds of  perfume, garlands, ointments, and lamps. Being the chief mantra in its own tradition, it can accomplish, in short, anything that it is employed for. It is called Three Syllables. It is a great hero that accomplishes all purposes; it is the Great Lord of Wrath himself. And what is it? {2.4}</p>
<p>“Oṁ āḥ hrūṃ!”</p>
<p>This is the all-accomplishing heart mantra of the Great Lord of Wrath, prescribed by the great being Mañjughoṣa for all maṇḍalas and all types of mantra practice. It will destroy all obstacles. {2.5}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, then raised his right hand and, placing it next to the head of Lord of Wrath, said, “Homage to all the buddhas! May the lord buddhas, established in the infinite world spheres throughout the ten directions, pay heed! May the bodhisattvas with great magical powers, present throughout the limitless universe, empower this pledge!” {2.6}</p>
<p>Having said this, he turned the Lord of Wrath around and dispatched him. As soon as he was dispatched, the Great Lord of Wrath went to every world sphere and, in an instant, subjugated all ill-willed beings possessed of great magical powers and brought them into the great assembly in the realm of the Pure Abode. Having thus established them there, he assumed a form surrounded by a blaze of light and placed himself atop the heads of the evil beings. {2.7}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, looking at the gathering, said, “Please listen, all you respectable beings! Anyone who would transgress my samaya will here be brought into submission by the Lord of Wrath. For that reason  the words of the lord buddhas and the bodhisattvas who possess great magical powers—the words that convey the meaning of the samaya pledges and the secret mantra—should not be disobeyed. Please listen well and keep in your minds what I will tell you. {2.8}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, ra ra! Do remember! O perfect teacher possessing the form of a divine youth! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!{2.9}</p>
<p>“This, friends, is my root mantra. It is called Noble Mañjuśrī. The mudrā that should be employed with this root mantra is the so-called great five-crested mudrā. {2.10}</p>
<p>“Next is the all-accomplishing heart mantra. I will now pronounce this auspicious mantra that is suitable for all actions:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, this [mantra] is [my] homage to speech!{2.11}</p>
<p>“The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is the one called three-crested. It increases all pleasure and good fortune. {2.12}</p>
<p>“There is, in this set, also the subsidiary heart mantra:</p>
<p>“Speech, hūṁ!{2.13}</p>
<p>“The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is also the one called three-crested. It will magically summon any being. {2.14}</p>
<p>“There is, in this set, also the ultimate, one-syllable heart mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ.{2.15}</p>
<p>“The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is the one called peacock seat. It enthralls all beings and captivates the hearts of all buddhas.{2.16}</p>
<p>“There is another mantra, of eight syllables, most propitious, with great purificatory power, which is called Great Hero. It severs the path of the threefold existence, it prevents all unhappy rebirths, it pacifies everything, it performs all activities, it brings forbearance, and it leads to nirvāṇa. It is like meeting the Buddha directly. I myself, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, have assumed the form of this most secret mantra for the benefit of beings. It fulfills all wishes and, merely by being called to mind, purifies the five acts of immediate retribution. Is there a need to say more? So, what is this mantra? {2.17}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, āḥ! O wise one,hūṁ! You, the sky traveler!</p>
<p>“Friends, this mantra is my very self in the form of the eight syllables.  It is a great hero, the ultimately secret heart mantra that is like buddhahood itself. It can, in short, help with any task. The extent of its qualities cannot be described in full even in many hundreds of thousands of millions of eons. There is also a mudrā that belongs with it—it is called great fortitude, and it fulfills all aspirations. {2.18}</p>
<p>“There is also, in this set of mantras, a summoning mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, he he! O divine youth! You [assume] every form to awaken childish beings through speech. Please come, O lord, come! You, who playfully hold the blue lotus of the divine youth, please remain in the center of the maṇḍala, please do! Please remember your samaya pledge! You are a perfect teacher, hūṁ! Do not delay! Act! Phaṭ, svāhā!{2.19}</p>
<p>“This mantra calls upon Lord Mañjuśrī and also summons all beings—all bodhisattvas, all pratyeka­buddhas, venerable śrāvakas, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, piśācas, rākṣasas, and all spirits. {2.20}</p>
<p>“Should one incant sandalwood water seven times and throw it upward, downward, across, and all around in the four directions, all the buddhas and bodhisattvas will come, along with Mañjuśrī himself with his retinue, all the mundane and supramundane mantra deities, the entire host of spirits, and all beings. {2.21}</p>
<p>The incense mantra is as follows:</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! [The mantra is:]</p>
<p>“Oṁ, dhu, be steady, be steady! Remain within the fragrant flame of incense, hūṁ! Remember your samaya! Svāhā!{2.22}</p>
<p>“Having blended together sandalwood, camphor, and saffron, one should offer it as incense to the tathāgatas, all the bodhisattvas, and all beings. Their minds gratified by the incense, they will all be drawn to it. The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is called garland of lotuses. This auspicious mudrā attracts all sentient beings. This is the mudrā of ritual activity, called garland of lotuses. {2.23}</p>
<p>“When all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and also all sentient beings, have arrived, one should prepare a welcome offering. Having infused water with camphor, sandalwood, and saffron, one should mix into it the flowers of royal jasmine, sacred jasmine, or Arabian jasmine; the blossoms of the pannay tree, cobra’s saffron tree, bulletwood tree, and the flowers of crepe jasmine; or any other fragrant flowers that may be in season. One should present the welcome offering while saying the following mantra: {2.24}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“He, he, O greatly compassionate one who assumes all forms! Please accept the welcome offering and let [the others] accept it. Remember your samaya pledge! Endure, endure! Enter into the center of the maṇḍala and let [the others] enter! You who have compassion for all beings, please take, take [this offering], hūṁ! Svāhā to the one who abides in space!{2.25}</p>
<p>“The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is called the complete; it is steadfast and suitable for all beings. There is also, in this set, the mantra of perfume: {2.26}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas! Homage to the tathāgata Glorious with Surrounding Fragrance and Light! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Gandhā, Gandhā! Rich in fragrance! You who gratify with fragrance! Take this perfume, take!Svāhā to the one who abides in equanimity!{2.27}</p>
<p>“In this set there is also the mudrā that fulfills all hopes called blossom, and a mantra of flowers, which is as follows: {2.28}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! Homage to the tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Kusumā, Kusumā! Rich in flowers! Dwelling in the flower palace with an abundance of flowers! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“One should burn incense while saying the mantra of incense given above. {2.29}</p>
<p>“Paying homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Inconceivable and marvelous in form,</p>
<p>I will now proclaim the bali mantra,</p>
<p>As taught by the completely awakened ones. {2.30}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“He, he! O venerable great being with the gaze of the Buddha! Do not delay! Please take this bali and let [the others] take it! Hūṁ, hūṁ! You with all [forms]! Ra ra, ṭa ṭa! Phaṭ! Svāhā!{2.31}</p>
<p>“One should offer, with the above mantra, bali of food that satisfies all the senses.  In this set there also is a mudrā called spear, which wards off all evildoers. Here belongs also the mantra of lamps: {2.32}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers who remove the darkness of ignorance! Homage to the tathāgata Splendid with Light and Fragrance All Around! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“He, he! O venerable lord with a body adorned with hundreds of thousands of rays of light! Please manifest [yourself] magically, please do! O great bodhisattva with a body illuminated by radiating light! Please frolic and play! Behold [with compassion] the totality of beings, behold! Svāhā!{2.33}</p>
<p>“This is the mantra of lamps; with it, one should offer butter lamps. The mudrā that belongs with it is called beholder of all beings. In this set belongs also the mantra that produces fire: {2.34}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Burn, burn! Set ablaze, set ablaze! Huṁ! {2.35}</p>
<p>“This is the mantra that produces fire. The mudrā that belongs with this mantra is called the hollow space. It is famed throughout the world and illuminates all beings with light. It has been taught before by the best among sages to the bodhisattva Dhīmat.”{2.36}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, said this to the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi:</p>
<p>“These mantric formulae, O lord of guhyakas, are most esoteric and require secrecy. {2.37}</p>
<p>“There is, known to belong to your buddha family,</p>
<p>A wrathful and terrifying son,</p>
<p>Whose every mantra, without exception,</p>
<p>Yields results for the wise. {2.38}</p>
<p>“His name is Mūrdhaṭaka and he belongs</p>
<p>To both the Vajra and the Lotus families.</p>
<p>The following formula is now taught</p>
<p>For the sake of invoking his power to expel. {2.39}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, act, act! Please carry out my task! Break all the troublemakers, break! Burn all the vajravināyakas, burn! Mūrdhaṭaka, you who bring death! One with misshapen form! Cook, cook all miscreants! Bringer of the death of Mahāgaṇapati! Bind, bind all the spirits who cause possession! O six-faced, six-armed, six-footed one! Please summon Rudra! Summon Viṣṇu! Summon the gods, Brahmā and so forth! Do not delay, do not delay! Protect, protect! Enter into the center of the maṇḍala! Remember your samaya pledge! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!{2.40}</p>
<p>“This mantra, O supreme lord of guhyakas, which is supremely secret, is called Six-Faced Mañjuśrī of Great Courage. He is the Great Lord of Wrath himself, the destroyer of all obstacle makers. As soon as it is recited, even the bodhisattvas established on the tenth bodhisattva level will flee, not to mention wicked trouble makers. As soon as it is recited, great protection is effected. The mudrā that belongs with it is called great spear; it destroys all obstacles. The following is the heart mantra of this Lord of Wrath: {2.41}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, hrīṁḥ, jñīḥ! You with contorted face, huṁ! Destroy all the enemies! Paralyze them! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“With this mantra one can afflict all enemies with severe pain or quartan fever. But if one keeps reciting for as long as one likes, or until loving kindness or compassion arise, the target will not be freed at the end of the recitation and will die. Thus, this should only be performed on enemies of the Three Jewels and not on others with peaceful minds. {2.42}</p>
<p>“One should also employ the mudrā great spear. In this set there is also a subsidiary heart mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, hrīṁḥ! O Kālarūpa! Huṁ, khaṁ! Svāhā!{2.43}</p>
<p>“Only the great spear mudrā should be employed. One will be able to deal with any wicked being that one wants to. There is also a supreme heart mantra, rich in the blessing of all the buddhas, consisting of just one syllable: {2.44}</p>
<p>“Hūṁ!</p>
<p>“This mantra accomplishes all ritual activities. With this mantra, too, only the great spear mudrā should be employed. It will put an end to all misfortune, and will enthrall all beings. In short, this mantra, the Lord of Wrath, can be employed in all ritual activities. It should be recited, especially at the time of the accomplishment, at the center of the maṇḍala. {2.45}</p>
<p>“The following are the mantras of dismissing:</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantras are:</p>
<p>“Win a victory, an auspicious victory, O most compassionate [lord] whose nature is everything!  Go, go to your own abode and dismiss [also] all the buddhas with their retinues. Cause them to return to their respective dwellings. Remember the pledge. May the words of [these] mantras fulfill my every purpose. Make my wishes come true, svāhā!{2.46}</p>
<p>“The above mantra of dismissing can be employed in all ritual activities. The accompanying mudrā is called auspicious seat. With this mudrā one should provide the seat. The dismissal is effected after mentally reciting the above mantra seven times. {2.47}</p>
<p>“Mastery of this mantra is useful for all mundane and supramundane maṇḍalas and mantras. It is to be applied to the observances at the time of samaya recitation.”{2.48}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, again directed his gaze at the Pure Abode and the great assembly gathered there, and taught in full the section on the mantras of the host of vidyās from his own great retinue-circle: {2.49}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>“Oṁ riṭi svāhā!</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Keśinī by name, is an attendant of Mañjuśrī and may be employed in all rites. When combined with the great five-crested mudrā, she may be employed in all rites involving poison. {2.50}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>“Oṁ niṭi!</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Upakeśinī by name, may be employed in all rites. When combined with the mudrā budding blossom, she may be employed in all rites involving demonic possession.{2.51}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, whose conduct is impeccable!</p>
<p>“Oṁ niḥ!</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Nalinī by name,</p>
<p>Is useful in all ritual activities.</p>
<p>When combined with the mudrā auspicious seat,</p>
<p>She will certainly summon yakṣiṇīs. {2.52}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Whose forms are inconceivable.</p>
<p>“Oṁ jñaiḥ svāhā!</p>
<p>“When combined with the mudrā spear,</p>
<p>This vidyā will kill all the ḍākinīs. {2.53}</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Kapālinī by name,</p>
<p>Was taught by Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>The buddhas perpetually praise</p>
<p>Her divine form.{2.54}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the followers of impeccable paths! The vidyā of Varadā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Varadā! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“With a propitious attitude,</p>
<p>One should combine this vidyā with the mudrā three-crested.</p>
<p>This vidyā goddess assumes many forms</p>
<p>And swiftly bestows good fortune. {2.55}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Whose forms are wondrous and inconceivable!</p>
<p>“Oṁ bhūri svāhā!</p>
<p>“When combined with the mudrā spear,</p>
<p>This vidyā will remove all fever. {2.56}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Whose forms are wondrous and inconceivable!</p>
<p>“Oṁ ture svāhā!</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Tārāvatī by name,</p>
<p>Is proclaimed to be effective in all rites.</p>
<p>When combined with the mudrā wand of power,</p>
<p>It will destroy obstacles. {2.57}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Whose forms are wondrous and inconceivable!</p>
<p>The next vidyā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vilokinī! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Lokavatī by name,</p>
<p>Can enthrall the entire world.</p>
<p>When combined with the mudrā the mouth,</p>
<p>It will grant every type of enjoyment. {2.58}</p>

<p>The next vidyā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you are the totality [of things], the source of everything, possessed of all forms! Summon, summon! Enter [them], enter! Remember your pledge! Ru ru! Please remain! Svāhā!{2.59}</p>
<p>“This vidyā, Mahāvīryā,</p>
<p>Was taught by guides of the world.</p>
<p>When combined with the fangs mudrā,</p>
<p>She, the auspicious, enters all weapons.</p>
<p>She is a granter of boons,</p>
<p>And proclaimed as the totality of all beings. {2.60}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>

<p>The next vidyā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you with the white, splendorous body! Svāhā!{2.61}</p>
<p>“When combined with the mudrā peacock seat,</p>
<p>This vidyā may be employed in all rites.</p>
<p>She is called Mahāśvetā, the brilliantly white one.</p>
<p>With her wondrous, inconceivable form,</p>
<p>She brings prosperity and happiness to the world,</p>
<p>Enthralling both men and women. {2.62}</p>

<p>“Her name is Ajitā, and she is</p>
<p>A girl of royal bearing arisen from ambrosia!</p>

<p>She will restrain all one’s enemies. {2.68}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Whose forms are wondrous and inconceivable!</p>
<p>The vidyā of the four sisters is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Jayā, svāhā! Vijayā, svāhā! Ajitā, svāhā! Aparājitā, svāhā!{2.69}</p>
<p>“These attendants upon bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Are referred to as the four sisters.</p>
<p>They wander the breadth of the earth,</p>
<p>Showing favor to living beings. {2.70}</p>
<p>“They are accompanied by their brother,</p>
<p>Who is referred to by the name Tumburu.</p>
<p>They travel in boats,</p>
<p>Dwelling on the water.</p>
<p>When this vidyā is combined with the mudrā the fist,</p>
<p>It will completely fulfill all wishes. {2.71}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>The supreme masters of the world!</p>
<p>The mantra of Mañjuśrī-Kārttikeya is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, divine youth! Great prince, play, play! O six-faced one, authorized by the bodhisattvas! Mounted on a peacock seat and raising your hand with a spear in it! Your color is red and you are fond of red fragrances and unguents. Kha kha! Eat, eat, eat! Huṁ! Dance, dance! Your images are worshiped with red flowers. Please remember your samaya! Move about, move! Stir them up, do, do! Quick, quick! Don’t delay! Carry out all my tasks, do! You with a bright and colorful form, remain, remain, huṁ! You have the authorization from all of the buddhas, svāhā!”{2.72}</p>
<p>The bodhisattva Mañjughoṣa, the protector,</p>
<p>Spoke these words</p>
<p>And the entire earth shook all around</p>
<p>In six different ways. {2.73}</p>
<p>At that moment, this terrifying son of Maheśvara</p>
<p>Arrived in this world for the benefit of all beings,</p>
<p>To restrain every wicked being,</p>
<p>And for the sake of those to be trained. {2.74}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Skanda, who is marked with</p>
<p>The distinguishing marks of the planet Mars,</p>
<p>Should be recited in a soft voice</p>
<p>And with the mind filled with compassion. {2.75}</p>
<p>“He is a magnanimous bodhisattva,</p>
<p>Acting for the benefit of naive beings.</p>
<p>Since he is engaged in virtuous conduct,</p>
<p>He wanders everywhere throughout the world. {2.76}</p>
<p>“When his mantra is combined with the mudrā shaft of a spear,</p>
<p>This magnanimous being can bring forth</p>
<p>Even the state of Brahmā, and so forth,</p>
<p>Let alone the state of a human being. {2.77}</p>
<p>“In short, all deafness and dumbness</p>
<p>Can be destroyed by this divine youth,</p>
<p>For his mantra, when pronounced,</p>
<p>Is Mañjuśrī-Kārttikeya himself. {2.78}</p>
<p>“This bodhisattva has arrived in this world</p>
<p>With the desire to show kindness to beings.</p>
<p>The mantra called Three Syllables</p>
<p>Has been taught as his heart mantra. {2.79}</p>
<p>“He is completely dedicated to bringing enjoyments</p>
<p>In order to benefit all beings.</p>
<p>Combined with the mudrā shaft of a spear,</p>
<p>This three-syllable mantra may be used in all rites. {2.80}</p>
<p>“Oṁ hūṁ jaḥ.</p>
<p>“The above mantra, in short,</p>
<p>Will bring about birth as a human. {2.81}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas,</p>
<p>With their forms all radiant!</p>
<p>The auxiliary heart mantra of Kārttikeya is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you disfigured graha! Huṁ phaṭ, svāhā!{2.82}</p>
<p>“When this subsidiary heart mantra is combined,</p>
<p>Optionally, with the mudrā spear,</p>
<p>It will ward off spirits, including grahas,</p>
<p>As well as the mātṛs. {2.83}</p>
<p>“This mantra will produce results</p>
<p>When combined with any of the above mudrās;</p>
<p>It will frighten away evil beings</p>
<p>And release beings from their possession. {2.84}</p>
<p>“This divine youth called Mañjuśrī-Kārttikeya is an attendant of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. He may be employed in all rites. By merely reciting him, he will accomplish all tasks—frighten any being away, summon it, enthrall it, cause it to wither, or smash it; or, he will bring whatever the practitioner who has mastered his mantra may desire. {2.85}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>The mantra of Brahmā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Brahmā, good Brahmā! You with infinite energy and splendor! Bring peace, svāhā!{2.86}</p>
<p>“This mantra is the great Brahmā;</p>
<p>He has been taught by the bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī].</p>
<p>Living beings can attain soothing calm</p>
<p>The very moment they recite it. {2.87}</p>
<p>“If, in addition, the five-crested mudrā is employed,</p>
<p>Good fortune will soon follow.</p>
<p>It is taught in all rites of assault</p>
<p>On the authority of the Atharva Veda.</p>
<p>This procedure has been concisely taught here</p>
<p>In its abridged form. {2.88}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>The mantra of Viṣṇu is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you with a garuḍa for a mount! Holding a discus in your hand! The four-armed one! Hūṁ hūṁ! Remember your samaya! Bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī] is commanding you, svāhā!{2.89}</p>
<p>“Commanded by Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>He, the peaceful one, will promptly accomplish the assigned task.</p>
<p>In his form of Viṣṇu, he will expel spirits</p>
<p>From the bodies of living beings.{2.90}</p>
<p>“When employed in conjunction with the mudrā three-crested,</p>
<p>He will promptly and resolutely carry out his tasks.</p>
<p>Whatever elaborate rites</p>
<p>Were expounded in Vaiṣṇava tantras</p>
<p>Had been taught by Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>As the means to guide sentient beings. {2.91}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>The mantra of Śiva is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, great Maheśvara, lord of living beings! Having a bull for an emblem! With your matted hair hanging down from a topknot, and your form ash-colored with [the dusting of] white ashes! Hūṁ, phaṭ phaṭ! Bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī] is commanding you, svāhā!{2.92}</p>
<p>“This mantra has been proclaimed by me,</p>
<p>Wishing to benefit living beings.</p>
<p>Used in combination with the mudrā spear,</p>
<p>It will destroy all evil spirits. {2.93}</p>
<p>“The old rites of [Śiva],</p>
<p>Which I formerly taught,</p>
<p>Are described, by beings who dwell</p>
<p>On the surface of this earth, as Śaivite.</p>
<p>Different rites of great value, taught by me,</p>
<p>Can be found in the Śaiva tantras. {2.94}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>The mantra of Vainateya is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, bird, great bird! With your wings spread like lotuses! Destroyer of all serpents! Kha kha! Devour, devour! Remember your samaya, hūṁ! Remain! Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī is commanding you, svāhā!{2.95}</p>
<p>“This mantra is intensely potent;</p>
<p>It is known by the name Vainateya.</p>
<p>It is the supreme tamer of those who are difficult to tame</p>
<p>And the destroyer of the poison of snakes. {2.96}</p>
<p>“Used in combination with the great mudrā,</p>
<p>It kills the evil and the cruel ones.</p>
<p>It will cure poison without a doubt,</p>
<p>Whether it is of animate or inanimate origin. {2.97}</p>
<p>“Commanded by the bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī],</p>
<p>This king of birds, great in splendor,</p>
<p>Travels to different places in the form of a garuḍa</p>
<p>To train sentient beings by skillful means. {2.98}</p>
<p>“Whatever elaborate rites</p>
<p>Were expounded in the Garuḍa tantras</p>
<p>Were all taught by me alone</p>
<p>For the good of sentient beings. {2.99}</p>
<p>“That garuḍa bird is a bodhisattva</p>
<p>Who has arrived in this world in order to guide beings.</p>
<p>He wanders around in a bird’s form</p>
<p>To destroy the poison of serpents. {2.100}</p>
<p>“Whatever worldly mantras there are,</p>
<p>They have been taught in this manual of rites.</p>
<p>I apply them in whatever way is necessary</p>
<p>In order to guide sentient beings. {2.101}</p>
<p>“As for the mantras of the tathāgatas</p>
<p>Of both the Vajra or the Lotus families,</p>
<p>They have been taught</p>
<p>In this extensive manual and also before.{2.102}</p>
<p>“Just as a mother enthusiastically plays</p>
<p>With her child in various ways,</p>
<p>In the same way I assume different mantra forms</p>
<p>For the sake of naive beings. {2.103}</p>
<p>“What was previously taught by those of the ten powers</p>
<p>I have now taught.</p>
<p>The entire subject matter of the mantra system</p>
<p>Has also been explained by the divine youth of great splendor. {2.104}</p>
<p>“The verses sung by the supreme victors,</p>
<p>And those sung by the sons of those of the ten powers,</p>
<p>Have also been sung by Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>In many wondrous and inconceivable forms.” {2.105}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, gazing at the realm of the Pure Abode and the great gathering that had assembled there, entered the samādhi called the one that animates all samayas. When this samādhi is entered, every being develops the intention to engage in conduct to liberate all sentient beings.{2.106}</p>
<p>As soon as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, entered this samādhi, the entire realm of the Pure Abode changed, by way of a wondrous and inconceivable transformation through his bodhisattva power, into a beautiful maṇḍala adorned with ornaments of jewels and gems of many colors. None of those who have undertaken the conduct of pratyeka­buddhas or venerable śrāvakas, nor any of the bodhisattvas, these mighty lords established on the tenth level, would be able to paint or supervise the painting of such a maṇḍala, so what need is there to mention ordinary people? {2.107}</p>
<p>When they beheld Mañjuśrī, the princely youth, established in the state of accomplishment of the samaya of this divine, noble maṇḍala, all the blessed buddhas, pratyeka­buddhas, venerable śrāvakas, bodhisattvas established on the tenth level, crown princes consecrated to kingship, and all those who undertook their respective conduct including beings that are free from or subject to karmic influences perceived themselves, through the blessing of the divine youth Mañjuśrī, as being part of this inconceivable maṇḍala arisen as the consequence of buddha or bodhisattva activity through the mental power of his special samādhi. It is not possible for ordinary people even to visualize this maṇḍala in their minds, let alone paint it or supervise a painting of it. {2.108}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, addressed the beings who were about to enter the samaya of the maṇḍala of this great assembly as follows:</p>
<p>“Listen, friends! This samaya must not be violated even by the tathāgatas and the bodhisattvas, let alone by other beings, be they noble or not.” {2.109}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, spoke to Vajrapāṇi, the general of the guhyakas:</p>
<p>“Mentally generated samayas beyond the scope of humans have been taught before, O son of the victorious ones. But I will now teach the samaya of the completely liberated tathāgatas, suitable for humans, whereby beings, once they have entered it, will attain the accomplishment of all worldly and transcendent mantras.”{2.110}</p>
<p>Vajrapāṇi, the general of the guhyakas, replied to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, “Speak, speak, O son of the victorious ones, if the time seems right to you! {2.111}</p>
<p>“Once the protector of the world,</p>
<p>The Lion of the Śākyas, had entered into perfect nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>You created a maṇḍala here on earth</p>
<p>That is, for beings, like awakening itself. {2.112}</p>
<p>“For, when this maṇḍala is merely seen,</p>
<p>One will attain, in this world, the accomplishment of mantra.</p>
<p>But if the rite is corrupted out of ignorance,</p>
<p>Or if one does not master the samaya, {2.113}</p>
<p>“One will not accomplish the mantras,</p>
<p>Even though one may be as great as Brahmā.</p>
<p>If one does not apply oneself to this tantra</p>
<p>And does not meet with its teaching on the samaya,{2.114}</p>
<p>“One will not accomplish the mantras,</p>
<p>Even if one exerts oneself again and again.</p>
<p>If one’s application of the samaya is corrupt,</p>
<p>Then even if one has the perseverance of Śakra, {2.115}</p>
<p>“One will not accomplish the mantras;</p>
<p>How then could the humans on earth?</p>
<p>However, when one knows the true teaching on the samaya</p>
<p>And performs the activities pertaining to conduct,</p>
<p>The mantras will be accomplished as soon as they are recited,</p>
<p>Be they worldly or noble. {2.116}</p>
<p>“One who has entered the maṇḍala of Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>Will be able to accomplish all activities.</p>
<p>One will definitely attain the accomplishment of mantra</p>
<p>Just as in the teachings of the divine youth.” {2.117}</p>
<p>At that moment, Vajrapāṇi, the general of the guhyakas, supplicated the great being Mañjuśrī:</p>
<p>“Ho, ho, great bodhisattva! Please teach concisely the maṇḍala procedure for the benefit of all beings.” {2.118}</p>
<p>Being thus requested by the general of the guhyakas, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, commenced teaching the maṇḍala procedure for the benefit of all beings. {2.119}</p>
<p>“To start, on a bright fortnight of the month of Caitra or Vaiśākha, which is a ‘fortnight of miracles,’ on an auspicious day, after ascertaining the favorable positions of the planets and when the moon is in the right constellation, either on the first day of the bright fortnight or during the full moon, or at some other time, other than the rainy months, one should consecrate the ground in the morning. {2.120}</p>
<p>“One should take one’s quarters in a city, or where oneself or the maṇḍala master lives, or by a river that flows into the ocean, or near an ocean shore that is to the northeast of the city, neither too near nor too far from  where the maṇḍala master lives. One should build there a hut of leaves and stay there alone for a period of a week or two. {2.121}</p>
<p>“There, one should choose a place on the ground that is clean, covers a square area measuring sixteen or twelve cubits across, and is free from stones, gravel, ash, coals, chaff, eggshells, and bones. Having cleaned and prepared this place well, one should sprinkle it using water that is free of living organisms and mixed with the five products of the cow, or water mixed with sandalwood, camphor, and saffron. This water should be incanted one thousand and eight times with Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, recited while forming the great five-crested mudrā. One should throw the water in the four cardinal and four intermediate directions, upward, downward, horizontally, and all around the area. {2.122}</p>
<p>“This square area on the ground with four equal sides may be sixteen, twelve, or eight cubits across—sixteen cubits is the largest size, twelve the medium size, and eight cubits is the smallest. Such a maṇḍala has been proclaimed by the all-knowing ones to be of three kinds: the largest is for those who desire kingship, the medium serves for bringing enjoyments, and the smallest, which merely safeguards the samaya, can be used in all activities as it is auspicious. {2.123}</p>
<p>“One should thus draw the maṇḍala in the size that one desires, and excavate its area to the depth of two cubits. If one sees stones, coals, ashes, bones, hairs, or any other products of living beings, one should dig at another location. It ought to be a place where one will not be obstructed or disturbed. If such a place is difficult to find, one should go to a mountaintop, or dig the layers of sand, or other soil, on the beach of an estuary, the sea, or a large river. After examining the place with great care, cleaning it, and removing all living creatures, one should draw the outline. {2.124}</p>
<p>“One should further smear this entire area with the five products of the cow mixed with water uncontaminated by living organisms and fill it with unpolluted clay from a riverbank or an anthill, making sure that the clay does not contain living creatures. Once the area has been filled and well beaten, with an even surface, one should create the threefold maṇḍala as required, with a well-beaten and even surface all over.  In its four corners one should plant four stakes made of cutch wood, incanting them seven times with the Lord of Wrath. Then, having likewise incanted a five-colored thread seven times with the heart mantra of the Lord of Wrath, one should completely enclose with it the maṇḍala, tracing its four-sided shape. {2.125}</p>
<p>“One should trace in the same way a four-sided shape delimiting the intermediate area and another one delimiting the inner area. The maṇḍala master, standing in the intermediate area, should recite the root mantra of his own vidyā one thousand and eight times. By forming the great five-crested mudrā while reciting the root mantra the master will afford protection for his assistants and himself. After reciting, he should step outside and circumambulate the maṇḍala clockwise. Then, facing east, he should sit on a bundle of kuśa grass and contemplate all the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Then, he should completely surround the maṇḍala with kuśa grass, tracing its quadrangular shape. On the outside of it, he should keep two cows for one night without food and then have them led away.{2.126}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master, who has completed the preparatory rites, is skilled in the art of mantra in his tantric tradition, is fully intent on the Mahāyāna goal of benefiting sentient beings through skillful means, and has fasted for one night, should prepare, with help from his able assistants and following the prescribed procedure as gleaned from scientific treatises (śāstra), five-colored powder, finely ground, sparkling, and well refined. Having incanted it with the six-syllable heart mantra, he should place it in the center of the maṇḍala.{2.127}</p>
<p>“On the outside, he should adorn the area with raised banners and flags and four gateways. Upon supports of plantain posts he should hang clusters of fruits and have the area resound with kettledrums, tambourines, and the sounds of conchs and lutes. He should have others recite texts of the Mahāyāna sūtras, with their exalted words, containing Dharma teachings suitable for the fourfold assembly. They should be recited in the four quarters as follows: {2.128}</p>
<p>“The blessed Prajñāpāramitā should be read in the south,  the noble Candra­pradīpa­samādhi in the west, the noble Gaṇḍavyūha in the north, and the noble Suvarṇa­prabhāsottama­sūtra in the eastern direction. If the texts are not available, the master should instruct four Dharma reciters, learned in these four sūtras, to recite them accordingly. Then the maṇḍala master, rising up in order to listen to the Dharma, should strew white flowers of nice fragrance mixed with sandalwood, camphor, and saffron all over the maṇḍala while reciting the root mantra. Having thus bestrewn it, he should exit the maṇḍala. {2.129}</p>
<p>“After seven days, he should bring in two or three highly skilled painters of sacred images—ones who rely on sacrificial food, give rise to bodhicitta, and follow the prescribed observances and fasts. The master should tie their hair into topknots while reciting the root mantra. Then, after obtaining nice and finely ground powder in five vivid colors and made from gold, silver, and various shining jewels, the master should request some great kings who follow the Dharma, very wealthy and pure, to commission the painters to do the main drawing, one which has awakening for its goal and invariably leads to such.{2.130}</p>
<p>“One attains this goal of awakening through merely seeing the maṇḍala—</p>
<p>What need is there then to speak of its bringing about the accomplishment of the mantra?</p>
<p>After the best of the Śākyas has reached nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And at a time when beings have but little merit,</p>
<p>How could such a boon be found?</p>
<p>But yet this rite is now being taught. {2.131}</p>
<p>“Seeing the misery of poor humanity,</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa, great in splendor,</p>
<p>Will now briefly teach the maṇḍala</p>
<p>With a summary of its ritual.{2.132}</p>
<p>“One should color the maṇḍala</p>
<p>Using finely ground rice grains,</p>
<p>Brightly dyed in five colors—</p>
<p>White, yellow, red, dark blue, and green.{2.133}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master should take up the previously prepared powder, form the great five-crested mudrā, and seal the powder with it while reciting the root mantra. He should have the second officiating master dig a fire pit outside of the maṇḍala to the southeast, following the prescribed ritual.  The pit should be two cubits across and one cubit deep, its rim with anthers like a lotus flower.{2.134}</p>
<p>“A fire should be lit outside using sticks of the bilva tree for firewood and sticks of the dhak tree, as thin as the anthers of a lotus flower, for kindling. The former should be nine inches long, moist with sap, and smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. The officiant should summon the fire deity by reciting the root mantra or the six-syllable heart mantra while forming the mudrā the fist. Having summoned it, he should use the previously explained single-syllable root mantra or the heart mantra to once again perform one hundred and eight oblations. {2.135}</p>
<p>“Then the master of the maṇḍala, having tied on a turban and prepared the implements, should himself guide the skilled painters in their work. Thinking of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, he should light incense while saying the same incense mantra as previously specified. Folding his cupped palms together, he should bow to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. Having thus paid homage, he should fetch the colored powders and let the painters do their work. They should fill in with the powders each shape as outlined. Employing this procedure, the maṇḍala master should first supervise the painting of the blessed lord, Buddha Śākyamuni endowed with all the supreme features, sitting on a bejeweled lion throne in the realm of the Pure Abode and teaching the Dharma. When the image has been created, the assistant to the maṇḍala master should perform self-protection by reciting the root mantra and then offer bali that satisfies all spirits. He should throw it into the four directions outside of the maṇḍala and also upward and downward. {2.136}</p>
<p>“After bathing, ritually pure and wearing clean clothes, he should go to the fire pit and perform the rite of protection and offer one thousand and eight oblations of ghee mixed with saffron while reciting the root mantra. Subsequently, he should sit down on a bundle of kuśa grass and remain there, reciting. {2.137}</p>
<p>“He should incant white mustard seeds one hundred and eight times with Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, and place them between two earthenware bowls. If an obstacle maker is perceived in any form, be it a misshapen figure, a terrible sound, wind, rain, bad weather, or any other form, the assistant should, in a wrathful state of mind, offer seven mustard seed oblations. The obstacles will then vanish. If the obstacle makers are human, he should offer five oblations. They will become paralyzed, lose their strength, and die or will immediately be seized by nonhuman beings. There is no doubt about this. Even Śakra would die swiftly, let alone human beings with wicked minds or other obstacle makers. Seized by the fear of Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, they will disappear, fleeing in all directions. {2.138}</p>
<p>“The assistant should remain seated at the same place, on a bundle of kuśa grass, and keep reciting Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath. The master of the maṇḍala should then let the painters execute the painting of two pratyeka­buddhas, sitting in a cross-legged posture on lotus seats to the right of the painting of Lord Śākyamuni. Below the pratyeka­buddhas, two great śrāvakas listening to the Dharma discourse should be painted. {2.139}</p>
<p>“To the right of them, there should be the blessed lord, the noble Avalokiteśvara, adorned with every ornament, white as the autumn moon, sitting on a lotus seat, holding a lotus with his left hand and making a boon-granting gesture with his right. To the right of him, again, there should be the blessed Pāṇḍaravāsinī, holding a lotus with her left hand and saluting Lord Śākyamuni with her right, sitting on a lotus seat, and wearing a diadem on her hair tied in a topknot, a turban of white silk, white garments, and a tightly fitting silken bodice. She should be painted with three dots made of black ash. Tārā and Bhṛkuṭī should be depicted in a similar way, sitting on their respective seats and displaying their specific postures. Above them are the blessed Prajñāpāramitā, Tathāgata­locanā, and Uṣṇīṣarājñī.{2.140}</p>
<p>“The sixteen bodhisattvas should also be included: Samantabhadra; Kṣitigarbha; Gaganagañja; Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin; Apāyajaha; Maitreya with yak-tail whisk in his hand and looking at the Blessed Buddha; Vimalamati; Vimalaketu; Sudhana; Candraprabha; Vimalakīrti; Bhaiṣajyarāja; Sarva­dharmīśvara­rāja; Lokagati; Mahāmati; and Patidhara. Each of these sixteen great bodhisattvas should be depicted in a peaceful form adorned with all types of jewelry. {2.141}</p>
<p>“The chief vidyārājas and vidyārājñīs should all be painted in the forms and postures of the Lotus family as passed down by the tradition or described in scriptures and arranged in their respective places. On the periphery, a four-sided area should be designated and strewn with lotus flowers; in this should be included whatever other vidyā deities one can think of. {2.142}</p>
<p>“The two pratyeka­buddhas on the right side of Lord Śākyamuni, as mentioned above, are Gandhamādana and Upāriṣṭa. The maṇḍala, facing east, should have entry gates painted on all sides. On the left side of Lord Śākyamuni should be the other two pratyeka­buddhas, Candana and Siddha. Below them should be the two great śrāvakas, Mahākāśyapa and Mahākātyāyana. {2.143}</p>
<p>“To their left is the noble Vajrapāṇi in his peaceful form, dark blue like a water lily, adorned with all types of jewelry. He holds a fly-whisk in his right hand; his left is clenched into a vajra fist in an expression of wrath. Vajrāṅkuśī, Vajraśṛṅkhalā, Subāhu, and Vajrasenā should all be painted in their respective locations, wearing their specific apparel and emblems and surrounded by retinues of vidyārājas and vidyārājñīs.  Their forms, postures, and so forth should be drawn according to the tradition. To their left, a symbol of the double vajra should be painted in the shape of a square. Once painted, the following should be said: ‘In this place, where vidyā beings have not been known to assemble, may they now come to reside.’{2.144}</p>
<p>“Above them should be painted the six pāramitā goddesses and the blessed Māmakī, all of them with serene forms adorned with all types of jewelry. Above them are the eight uṣṇīṣa kings, each surrounded by a halo of blazing light. Having first formed the appropriate mudrā, the respective forms of these great cakravartin kings should be painted, golden in color, with pacified senses and adorned with all types of jewelry. Their gaze is cast slightly in the direction of the image of the Tathāgata (Śākyamuni). These eight are Cakra­vartyuṣṇīṣa, Abhyudgatoṣṇīṣa, Sitātapatra, Jayoṣṇīṣa, Kamaloṣṇīṣa, Vijayoṣṇīṣa, Tejorāśi, and Unnatoṣṇīṣa. {2.145}</p>
<p>“These eight uṣṇīṣa kings should be painted to the left of the pratyeka­buddhas. At the gate should be two bodhisattvas: to the right of the entrance, one called Lokātikrānta­gāmin, and to the left, the great bodhisattva called Ajitañjaya. The first should be depicted as having a peaceful form, wearing a diadem on his topknotted hair, holding a rosary in his right hand and a water jar in his left, facing the gate, and with a slight frown on his face. The other has a peaceful form, wears a diadem on his topknotted hair and carries a staff and a water jar in his left hand, and in his right hand, which displays a boon-granting gesture, he carries a rosary. He should be painted facing the gate, with a slight frown on his face. {2.146}</p>
<p>“Below the lion throne should be painted a Dharma wheel surrounded by a halo of blazing light. Below that should be painted a jeweled palace within which is Lord Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the great bodhisattva, with a youthful body of pale saffron color. He has a peaceful form of beautiful appearance and a gentle smile on his face. In his left hand he holds a blue lotus; with his right he displays a boon-granting gesture and holds a wood-apple fruit. {2.147}</p>
<p>“He is adorned with all the ornaments of youth and is decorated with five locks of hair. He wears a string of pearls, a sacred cord, a silken bodice, and garments of silk. Shining in all directions, he is surrounded by a halo of blazing light. He sits on a lotus seat facing the entrance gate of the maṇḍala and looks toward Yamāntaka, Lord of Wrath. He should be painted as being beautiful to behold in every respect. {2.148}</p>
<p>“On his right side, below the lotus, should be painted Yamāntaka, Lord of Wrath, in his ugly misshapen form, completely surrounded by blazing light. Awaiting a command, he looks at the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. He should be painted complete in every detail. On the left side of Mañjuśrī, below the lotus, should be painted five bodhisattvas in the form of gods of the realm of the Pure Abode. These five are Sunirmala, Sudānta, Suśuddha, Tamodghātana, and Samantāvaloka. All of them should be depicted as residing in the realm of the Pure Abode, their beautiful forms covered with flowers and bright all around with multicolored light like multifaceted gemstones. {2.149}</p>
<p>“The inner maṇḍala has an outer perimeter in the shape of a square. It has four archways and shines in the four cardinal directions with a vivid light of five colors. It should be demarcated with nicely colored cord stretched in straight lines. In the eastern quarter, above Lord Śākyamuni, is Saṃkusumita Rājendra. He should be drawn in the center within the cord-lined area, sitting on a lotus,  with the body of a tathāgata but small in size, and surrounded by a halo of blazing light. His right hand displays the boon-granting gesture, and he sits in the cross-legged posture. {2.150}</p>
<p>“To the right and left of Saṃkusumita Rājendra should be drawn, respectively, the mudrās of the uṣṇīṣa [kings] Cakravartin and Tejorāśi. The mudrā of Prajñāpāramitā should be drawn above Tathāgata­locanā. Above the noble Avalokiteśvara and to the right of the mudrā of Prajñāpāramitā should be drawn Lord Amitābha with the body of a tathāgata. With his right hand Amitābha displays the boon-granting gesture; he sits on a lotus seat and is surrounded by a halo of blazing light. {2.151}</p>
<p>“To Amitābha’s right the mudrās of the alms bowl and the monk’s robe should be drawn. Following the sequence, the lotus mudrā should be drawn at the entrance. To the left of Lord Saṃkusumita Rājendra, the mudrā of the uṣṇīṣa king Tejorāśi should be drawn surrounded by a halo of blazing light. To his left the thus-gone Ratnaketu should be drawn sitting upon a jewel mountain and expounding the Dharma. He should be depicted as surrounded by light emanating all around from a multicolored blaze of sapphires, beryls, emeralds, and rubies. {2.152}</p>
<p>“To the left of Ratnaketu should be painted the mudrā of Jayoṣṇīṣa, surrounded by a halo of blazing light. To its left is the mudrā of the Dharma wheel, with light blazing all around it. To its left are the mudrās of a mendicant’s staff, water jar, rosary, and the auspicious throne. Next in sequence, at the gate of the maṇḍala, should be painted an earth vajra with three prongs at either end, radiating blazing light. The great five-crested mudrā and the utpala mudrā, both radiating blazing light and connected to one another, should be painted below Lord Mañjuśrī. {2.153}</p>
<p>“Then the surrounding maṇḍala should be drawn. It should be made so that one enters it via the western gate, and it should be facing to the east. This outer maṇḍala should be painted in all its aspects the same as the inner one—it radiates five-colored light, is beautiful to behold in its vividness, and it has four gateways in the four cardinal directions. It should extend two cubits beyond the inner maṇḍala. {2.154}</p>
<p>“In the eastern quarter should be painted the Great Brahmā with four faces, wearing white apparel including a white shirt and a white sacred thread. He is of golden color, wears a diadem on his topknotted hair, and carries a water jar and a walking stick in his left hand. To his right there is a god from the Ābhāsvara realm—golden in color, distinguished in appearance due to his meditation, wearing silken garments and a silken shirt, and with a serene expression on his face. He wears a diadem on his topknotted hair and a white sacred thread. He sits in the cross-legged posture with his right hand displaying the boon-granting gesture. {2.155}</p>
<p>“To his right should be painted a god from the Akaniṣṭha realm, adorned with all types of jewelry. With his mind steeped in meditation, he is of peaceful appearance. He is wearing silk garments and a silk shirt, sits in the cross-legged posture, and displays with his right hand the boon-granting gesture. He is invested with a white sacred thread. The gods from the Tuṣita, Sunirmita, and Paranirmita realms should be painted following the same sequence, and they are headed by Suyāma and Śakra, each at his assigned location, and following the right order. Below Śakra should be painted gods from the realm of the four great kings, as well as the sadāmattas, mālādhārins, karoṭapāṇis, and vīṇādvītiyakas. The gods of the earth should likewise be painted sequentially arranged, with all their respective attributes. {2.156}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the southern quarter, the gods starting with those from the Avṛha, Atapas, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, Parīttābha, and Puṇyaprasava realms should be drawn, all in their respective places and wearing their individual ornaments.  The same should be done for the western and northern quarters. More are drawn below the ones just mentioned, arranged in two rows. {2.157}</p>
<p>“Outside of the second circle there is the third circle in which the four great kings are drawn sequentially in the four quarters. To the right of the entrance gate in the northern direction should be painted Dhanada in the form of a yakṣa standing next to a treasure trove. He is adorned with all types of jewelry and wears a slightly curved diadem. To his right are the two yakṣa generals, Maṇibhadra and Pūrṇabhadra. {2.158}</p>
<p>“Next, following the proper order, should be drawn the great yakṣiṇī Hārītī with an amiable boy sitting in her lap who is looking at the maṇḍala, as well as Pañcika, Piṅgala, and Vibhīṣaṇa, with the emblems (mudrā) of the yakṣas near them.{2.159}</p>
<p>“Following next, in the west, should be drawn Varuṇa with a noose in his hand, followed by the two nāgas Nanda and Upananda and the eight great nāga kings, starting with Takṣaka and Vāsuki. {2.160}</p>
<p>“In this way should be painted two sequentially arrayed rows of yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, ṛṣis, siddhas, pretas, piśācas, garuḍas, and other human and nonhuman beings, as well as medicinal herbs, gems and jewels in all their variety, mountains, rivers, and islands—with the chief and most important among them at the head. {2.161}</p>
<p>“In the southern quarter should be painted Yama along with his retinue, which includes the seven mothers. In the southeastern quarter is Agni, depicted as surrounded by a halo of flames; holding a staff, a water jar, and a rosary in his hands; wearing a diadem atop his matted hair; and dressed in white garments including a shirt of fine silk. He is of golden color, wearing a white sacred thread, and has a triple line drawn with ash on his forehead. They are all painted arranged in two rows, with their various respective adornments, weapons, attire, body postures, and colors. {2.162}</p>
<p>“All around the area outside this triple maṇḍala are distributed the following deities: Umā’s husband, riding a bull, with a trident in his hand; the goddess Umā herself, of golden color, adorned with all kinds of jewelry; and Kārttikeya, in his form of a divine youth with six faces and a red body, sitting on a peacock, raising a javelin in his hand, wearing yellow garments and a yellow shirt, and holding in his left hand a bell and a red banner. Next in sequence are Bhṛṅgiriṭi, extremely emaciated, Mahāgaṇapati, Nandikeśvara, Mahākāla, and the seven mothers. They should be painted with their respective adornments, weapons, attire, and body postures. {2.163}</p>
<p>“Next to be painted are the eight vasus and seven ṛṣis. Viṣṇu should be painted with four arms, holding a discus, a mace, a conch, and a sword. He rides a garuḍa and is adorned with all types of jewelry. Next are the eight grahas, the twenty-seven constellations, and the eight upagraha deities who roam the expanse of the earth. Following next are the personifications of the fifteen lunar days of the bright fortnight and the fifteen of the dark fortnight, the twelve signs of the zodiac, the six seasons, the twelve months, and of the year. Next are the four sisters, riding in boats, and the five brothers who live in water. For conciseness these deities can be represented by their respective mudrās and arranged sequentially in two rows. {2.164}</p>
<p>“In short, as regards the three maṇḍalas, one should draw them also as the three dwelling places (āśraya), each with the four corners, with the distribution [of the deities] as follows:{2.165}</p>
<p>“In short, Lord Buddha must be painted at the head of all beings. Representing the Lotus family, Noble Avalokiteśvara must be painted to Śākyamuni’s right. Representing the Vajra family, Noble Vajrapāṇi must be painted to Śākyamuni’s left. Samantabhadra must be painted at the head of all bodhisattvas, and likewise the divine youth, Mañjuśrī, should also be included. The remaining ones should each be represented by his or her mudrā in their respective places. This is how the inner maṇḍala should be painted. {2.166}</p>
<p>“In the middle maṇḍala, Brahmā Sahāmpati must be painted in the eastern quarter. Similarly, in the southern quarter are the Ābhāsvara and Akaniṣṭha gods, the form gods, and the gods from the realm of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness who do not appear in the maṇḍala in any particular form. In the northern quarter are the king of gods Śakra and the gods starting with those from the realms of Suyāma, Tuṣita, Sunirmita, Paranirmita, and Parīttābha. Each king of the gods’ realms must be painted individually. The rest should be represented by their respective mudrās. {2.167}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the third maṇḍala, Īśāna the Lord of Beings must be painted in the northern quarter together with Umā. Kārttikeya-Mañjuśrī should be painted near the second gate, riding on a peacock and holding a javelin in his hand. His body is of red color and he is dressed in a yellow upper shirt and other garments. In his right hand he holds a bell and a red banner. He possesses the beauty of a youth and looks upon the maṇḍala. Vainateya, who has the form of a bird, should always be painted in the eastern quarter, along with the sage Mārkaṇḍa. The rest should be represented by their respective mudrās. {2.168}</p>
<p>“In the southeastern division should be the four girls of royal bearing together with their brothers, the divine youths. They are aboard boats, traveling around the great ocean. Also Agni, the lord of gods, should always be painted in the same area of the maṇḍala. Also in the southern quarter should be painted Vibhīṣaṇa, the king of rākṣasas, in the country of Laṅkā. Also located there, dwelling in a neem tree, is the bodhisattva named Jambhala, the Lord of Waters, who has the form of a yakṣa. Painted next in the same sequence should be the king Yama, a preta of great power. So too the king of piśācas named Vikarāla. The remaining ones should be represented by their respective mudrās. {2.169}</p>
<p>“Similary, the two chief nāgas, Nanda and Upananda, and also  Āditya, the chief among celestial bodies, must be painted in the southwestern division. The best of ṛṣis, the sage named Kapila, should be in the western quarter. The preeminent one among non-Buddhists, he should have the form of a naked mendicant. The remaining ones should be represented by their respective mudrās, arranged in a proper order.{2.170}</p>
<p>“In the northwestern division should be the king of yakṣas Dhanada, the king of gandharvas Pañcaśikha, and the king of kinnaras Druma. These three must always be included in the painting. The remaining ones should be represented by their respective mudrās and arranged in sequence according to their respective places. {2.171}</p>
<p>“Outside the third maṇḍala there should be a fourth, comprised of five concentric zones and adorned with rows of mudrās. It has four sides, each including a gateway graced with [one of] the four great kings. The emblems are arranged in the following order: {2.172}</p>
<p>“At the entrance gate in the east should be painted a blue lotus. From right to left, there should be a lotus, vajra, axe, sword, trident, mace, discus, swastika, water jar, fish, conch, earring, banner, flag, noose, bell, dagger, bow, arrow, and hammer. All four of the maṇḍala’s sides should be filled with rows of symbols (mudrā) [representing] these various weapons and implements. Outside all of this, in the four directions, should be placed the four great oceans. {2.173}</p>
<p>“In the northern direction should be drawn a small four-sided maṇḍala, within which is placed a three-pronged double vajra that radiates blazing light. In the eastern direction should be drawn a small triangular maṇḍala, within which is placed a lotus that radiates blazing light. In the southern direction should be drawn a small bow-shaped maṇḍala, within which is placed a bowl that radiates blazing light. In the western direction should be drawn a small maṇḍala entirely made of light, within which is placed a blue lotus complete with a stalk and leaves and radiating blazing light. {2.174}</p>
<p>“In the four intermediate directions should be the following four mudrās, each of them blazing with light all around: A noose should be placed in the northwestern direction, within a round maṇḍala. A staff should be placed in the southwestern direction, within an elongated maṇḍala. An axe should be placed in the southeastern direction, within a triangular maṇḍala. A sword should be placed in the northeastern direction. {2.175}</p>
<p>“When all this has been drawn, three mudrās should be traced with colored powders outside the gate of the main maṇḍala: one above, one below, and one at the same level. The three mudrās to be painted are clothes, a fly-whisk, and a pair of shoes, each surrounded by blazing light.” {2.176}</p>
<p>This maṇḍala procedure</p>
<p>Has been taught here in brief</p>
<p>By the wise Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Out of his desire to benefit beings. {2.177}</p>
<p>“Then, the maṇḍala master should first of all select the right disciples. They should have unimpaired faculties and bodies beautiful in every limb; should belong to the brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, or śūdra castes; should have developed bodhicitta; should be followers of the Great Vehicle; should possess discipline that is not related to other vehicles; should be great beings (bodhisattvas); should have faith and follow the auspicious Dharma; should wish for the great kingship; should shun trivial enjoyments but delight in the great ones; should be gracious, well mannered, and disciplined; should be monks or nuns, or male or female lay practitioners; should observe their particular rules, fasts, and ritual observances; should abide by their vows of conduct; should not harbor hatred for great bodhisattvas; should belong to a spiritual family of many adherents; and should have a natural inclination to practice Dharma. {2.178}</p>
<p>“They will have fasted for one day and one night, put on clean clothes, nicely scented their hair, bathed three times, and observed silence. On the day of the empowerment, they should perfume their mouths with the fragrances of camphor, saffron, and cloves, and, after the regular performance of ritual besprinkling, they should sit on bundles of kuśa grass and have the protection ceremony performed for them. Celibate and committed to truth, they should be placed outside the maṇḍala Victorious over the Divisions of Time, not too far from it and not too near to it. Clean and ritually purified, they should number no more than between one and eight and be close associates of one another. They will include kṣatriyas who are closely associated with one another and great kings who have had their heads anointed, as well as their offspring—the princes and princesses who have not yet experienced sex. This is because Lord Mañjuśrī, the great bodhisattva in a youthful form, loves to engage in youthful play, awakening foolish people to realization. {2.179}</p>
<p>“Consequently, it is the princely youths who should be ushered in first. This will elevate their regal status and promote long life, health, power, and the ability to savor sensual enjoyments. In particular, this will stabilize the accomplishment of mantra for them, the inexperienced. {2.180}</p>
<p>“Once they are positioned in front, assigned an assistant, and attentive, the maṇḍala master should exit backward while burning incense of camphor. After exiting, he should bathe and besprinkle himself, as convenient for the season, with water that has been incanted one hundred and eight times with the root mantra and sealed with the great mudrā called five-crested. Dressed in clean white clothes, he should then approach the sacrificial fire pit, and, {2.181}</p>
<p>“Seated on the bundles of kuśa grass and facing northeast,</p>
<p>He should offer into the fire</p>
<p>One thousand and eight oblations consisting of</p>
<p>Camphor, saffron, and sandalwood mixed together.{2.182}</p>
<p>“Having summoned and then dismissed the deities according to the previously described procedure, he should again enter the maṇḍala. After entering he should prepare eight full vases draped in clean cloth, adorned with mango blossoms, and containing gold, silver, gems, grain, and rice. He should allocate the first to Lord Śākyamuni, the second to all the buddhas, the third to all the pratyeka­buddhas and the noble congregation of the śrāvakas, the fourth to all the great bodhisattvas,  the fifth to the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, and the sixth to all the gods. The seventh and the eighth should be placed in the niches by the gate of the second maṇḍala. They should be draped in clean white cloth. One of them should be assigned to all the spirits, and the second should be dedicated to all beings equally. {2.183}</p>
<p>“Then, following the previously described procedure, the maṇḍala master should burn incense and, forming the great five-crested mudrā, should do the summoning again. Following the procedure as before, he should summon all the buddhas, pratyeka­buddhas, noble śrāvakas, great bodhisattvas, spirits, and beings, as well as Mañjuśrī, the divine youth.{2.184}</p>
<p>“Similarly, he should offer, in a ritual as previously described, flowers, incense, fragrances, light, and foodstuffs; he should offer all this to all the recipients, thoroughly and in the right order. For the offering of light, he should offer butter lamps. When offering food to all the noble recipients and others, he should offer rice pudding with curds. {2.185}</p>
<p>“To all the tathāgatas he should offer cakes rich particularly in honey and milk and fried in butter, as well as pastry-rolls (vartī), candies (khaṇḍa), and other delicacies. To all the pratyeka­buddhas, noble śrāvakas, great bodhisattvas, and the noble deities he should offer dishes prepared with honey and cooked in milk, rich in butter, and flavored with chir pine resin. Similarly, to all the gods and hosts of spirits, and all beings in general, he should offer cake products, particularly sweetmeats, incanted with the mantra according to procedure. {2.186}</p>
<p>“Similarly, to all the buddhas, pratyeka­buddhas, noble śrāvakas, and great bodhisattvas as well as all noble and ordinary beings he should offer fragrant flowers as described before, starting with royal jasmine, crepe jasmine, champak, and the blossom of the pannay tree. Royal jasmine flowers are particularly suitable for the Tathāgata family, lotuses for the Lotus family, and water lilies for the family of Vajrapāṇi. For other mantra deities other flowers may be suitable. {2.187}</p>
<p>“Camphor incense is suitable for the Tathāgata family, sandalwood for the Lotus family,  and bdellium for the family of Vajrapāṇi, the lord of guhyakas. For all other mantra deities the master should offer a different incense. Butter lamps should be offered to all the noble ones, and scented oil lamps to all the ordinary mantra deities.{2.188}</p>
<p>“As for the successive procedures</p>
<p>That function as previously described,</p>
<p>These procedures are the same as the one taught for perfume</p>
<p>And are required in the case of all mantra deities.{2.189}</p>
<p>“Whatever has been taught by Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Or taught by Vajrapāṇi,</p>
<p>In their respective tantras,</p>
<p>On accomplishing the aims of mantra practice,</p>
<p>That also can be learned from this manual</p>
<p>And applied in every respect.{2.190}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master then, following the previously described procedure, should perform the ritual acts of summoning, making offerings, burning incense, and the rest, and he should offer food and service as well. Having done this, he should have his skillful assistants promptly prepare the meatless bali for all the spirits. He should have them beat the kettledrums, blow the conchs, and utter cries of joy in every direction. The bali should include incense, flowers, lamps, and garlands. {2.191}</p>
<p>“Circling then the maṇḍala to the right, the master should scatter the extensive bali that satisfies all spirits, upward, downward, and horizontally, into each of the four cardinal and four intermediate directions and everywhere outside the maṇḍala. After bathing, he should offer into the fire one thousand and eight oblations consisting of rice grains smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. As the master offers the oblations while reciting the heart mantra and the six-syllable root mantra, the great beings who have entered the maṇḍala and now stand before him; who have had the protection rite performed for them and have been accepted as disciples by the maṇḍala master; who have developed bodhicitta, observed the ritual fast, and offered their own bodies to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas; who for the sake of spiritual accomplishments share in the experiences of ordinary beings; who are fit to ascend to the seat of unsurpassable awakening; and who desire omniscient awakening will become liberated from all their vices through merely beholding the maṇḍala.  Even those people who have committed the five deeds of immediate retribution are immediately liberated. {2.192}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master then should cover the faces of the initiands who wish to enter the maṇḍala with a veil fashioned from a newly made, unbleached cloth from which the loose threads have been pulled out and hairs removed, that has been incanted with the root mantra seven times, and that has been anointed with fragrant ointments, sandalwood, and saffron. First, boys should be brought into the maṇḍala starting from the sixteen- and finishing with the three-year-olds. They may be embellished with either five decorative locks of hair or just one, and they may wear a topknot of hair or not. They should be princes whose crowns have been anointed, sons of kṣatriyas, or others of great endeavor who desire sovereignty. {2.193}</p>
<p>“When the initiand stands in the second maṇḍala with a veiled face, the master should form the utpala mudrā and have him recite the root mantra of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, once. Guiding his actions, he should give him a flower of nice fragrance and have him throw it onto the maṇḍala with both hands that have been purified with the mixture of sandalwood and saffron. The master should give him the mantra corresponding to the spot where the flower falls. {2.194}</p>
<p>“That is said to be his personal mantra and will stay with him through the succession of his future births. This mantra is like his spiritual guide; it will bring about his ascension to the seat of awakening and the complete unfolding of the omniscient knowledge of great bodhisattvas. He should master this mantra, which will bring great enjoyments, the status of a king, and the company of eminent people. That which is to be accomplished will be accomplished in this very life without doubt, including all the activities. {2.195}</p>
<p>“Thus, in due course, those who desire magical accomplishments will obtain each one of them until all eight are obtained, but no other accomplishments. If one desires other accomplishments, such as the removal of sins, only the samaya may be given. For this purpose, the maṇḍala master who bestows the empowerment  should first consecrate an area outside the maṇḍala toward the northeast, neither too far nor too near, by purifying it with the root mantra. Just as in the case of the royal empowerment, he should admit disciples whom he regards as single-mindedly devoted to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha; who have faith and great energy; who are never separated from bodhicitta and follow the Great Vehicle; and who serve the Three Jewels. They should have unimpaired faculties, be irreproachable, and wish to accomplish the mantras in this very life. Their hearts may be kind and their minds resolved upon mantra practice, or they may be merely interested in the nonconceptual meaning of the mantra out of curiosity and a desire to know. They should be granted the first through the fifth empowerments; the remaining ones should be omitted. Only those with the special qualities of insight and full understanding of the conduct should be initiated; others should not be. {2.196}</p>
<p>“The master should then collect the requisites as in every royal empowerment, or any that he finds pleasing. A canopy should be spread above him, banners and flags raised, and a white parasol should be held above his head. He should be fanned with a white yak-tail whisk with great care, and praised with well-wishing, auspicious, and excellent verses as spoken by the buddhas themselves, accompanied by cries of joy, the sounds of conchs, kettledrums and tambourines, and cries of victory. After circumambulating the maṇḍala clockwise, the disciples should bow to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, bow their heads to the master, and say the following: {2.197}</p>
<p>“ ‘O master! I will exert myself in order to engage in carrying out the mantra activities of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, in order to enter the secret maṇḍala of liberation that surpasses all that is mundane, and to realize the state of buddhahood that affords sovereignty over all phenomena. In short, I will become a buddha.’ {2.198}</p>
<p>“Then, the initiand should sit on a bundle of kuśa grass, facing east and looking at the maṇḍala. He will first be given the knowledge (vidyā) empowerment and then made to form the mudrā called five-crested. Then, whatever mantra he desires should be written on a leaf of birchbark with bovine bezoar. Having written it, he should smear both his hands and the interior of an earthenware vessel with sandalwood and saffron and place the birchbark leaf between two earthenware bowls. He should then place the leaf, enclosed between the two bowls, inside the maṇḍala at the soles of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī’s feet. {2.199}</p>
<p>“Next, the disciple sitting there should first be made to recite the root vidyā mantra one hundred and eight times and then should be consecrated while still sitting on the bundle of kuśa grass. The master should take the full vase that had been allocated to all beings in common from outside the inner maṇḍala where it was earlier placed near the gate and, while reciting the root mantra, anoint the disciple’s head. For the remaining empowerments, he should use whatever water is appropriate. {2.200}</p>
<p>“The earthenware container should then be handed to him, and, while a butter lamp is burning, he should be made to recite the mantra. If it is the same mantra, the disciple will succeed through merely reciting it. If it is a different one, he will succeed gradually, after applying effort. It is said that even if the mantra given to him lacks or has extra syllables, he can still succeed, without a doubt, at the first sādhana session, for this mantra was written earlier by the master himself. If he keeps practicing, he will arrive, within three sādhana sessions, at the stage where success comes without effort. In this way, the master should first give the knowledge empowerment. {2.201}</p>
<p>“As for the empowerment in the second maṇḍala, he should take the full vase that had been allocated to all the gods in this maṇḍala and anoint the disciple’s head with it. As before, this procedure will free him from all his vices. He is then authorized by all the buddhas to enter samayas for any worldly or transcendent maṇḍala, as well as the practice of  any mantra or mudrā. He will be blessed by all the bodhisattvas. Consequently, the master may now give him the ācārya empowerment.{2.202}</p>
<p>“The ācārya empowerment is given in the third maṇḍala. The master should take the full vase that had been allocated to all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas and, following the same procedure, anoint the disciple’s head with it. The master should say, ‘All the buddhas and bodhisattvas of great power have authorized you to write and recite all worldly and transcendent mantras, to use the instructions on the maṇḍala, and to give to others, as well as apply yourself, the instructions on the practice of the mantra methods, including the mudrās. In this very life, and in the lives to come until the final one, you will definitely obtain the state of awakening.’{2.203}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the empowerment of victory and the empowerment of conquest, the master should perform the sprinkling following the previously described procedure, using, respectively, the full vase that had been allocated to the blessed buddhas and the one allocated to the bodhisattvas. He should say, ‘You are authorized by all the blessed buddhas, the great bodhisattvas, and the śrāvakas, {2.204}</p>
<p>“ ‘Unassailable by any spirits,</p>
<p>And unconquerable by any embodied beings;</p>
<p>May you find victory through all the mantras</p>
<p>And accomplish whatever you desire.’{2.205}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master should,</p>
<p>According to each of their wishes,</p>
<p>Grant to all the disciples</p>
<p>The five empowerments, but only the five. {2.206}</p>
<p>“The master should then usher them, one by one, into the maṇḍala, present them to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, have them circumambulate the maṇḍala clockwise three times, and dismiss them. At a later time they should be gradually instructed in and enjoined to practice the mantra. On the present occasion, however, the master should take the full vase that had earlier been allocated to the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī  and make those disciples who have entered the maṇḍala drink three handfuls of water while facing east. He should say to them: {2.207}</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not generate a great amount of nonvirtue by transgressing the secret samaya of the divine youth, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. You must not discard any of the mantras. You must be loyal to all the buddhas or bodhisattvas and must please the master. Otherwise you will break your samaya, your mantras will not be successful, and there will be much nonvirtue.’ Having said this, he should dismiss them. {2.208}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master should, in addition, offer oblations of rice grains smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, while reciting the eight-syllable heart mantra. Getting up, he should then enter into the middle of the maṇḍala and make a welcome offering to all the visualized recipients using the previously mentioned flowers and following the procedure as previously described. Using the previously specified incense, he should make an incense offering to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas and noble śrāvakas, and all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, rākṣasas, piśācas, and bhūtas, as well as the divine yogins, siddhas, and ṛṣis and all beings. He should strew flowers over them, sprinkle them with water scented with sandalwood and saffron, and then dismiss them following the previously described procedure. He should imagine that all of them become liberated.{2.209}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master should then take the food, bali, and aromatic powder and let all these articles float upon a river. Alternatively, he should give them to suffering beings. He should select an area on the ground, sweep and clean it well, adorn it, and smear it with cow dung. Optionally, he may wash it with water, smear it with well-purified clay,  or cover it with sand. He should do this himself and may proceed as he desires. Those who have entered the maṇḍala should themselves partake of the milk porridge or sacrificial food.” {2.210}</p>
<p>This concludes the second chapter, that of the instructions on the maṇḍala procedure, from this great king of manuals that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings, an extensive bodhisattva textbook that is a miraculous display of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, again looked at the realm of the Pure Abode and, bowing to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas gathered together in that great assembly, pronounced the most secret single-syllable mantra, which removes all poisons and can be employed in all rites the mantra that is effective in the practices of his maṇḍala and which can also be used in all minor ritual activities. What is that mantra? {3.1}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas! This mantra is:</p>
<p>“jaḥ.</p>
<p>“This very mantra, friends and all hosts of spirits, the one syllable, is to be used, in short, in the second maṇḍala procedure.{3.2}</p>
<p>“After cleaning an area on the ground either eight or four cubits in size, it should be delimited using five-colored powder by oneself, not by anyone else. No matter where this is done, there is no fault. The area should be four sided, with sides of equal length, and should include the triple maṇḍala. First one should draw the great five-crested mudrā, the utpala mudrā of Lord Mañjuśrī, and the mudrās the fangs, the mouth, and the stick. These mudrās should be drawn in the eastern quarter of the inner maṇḍala. {3.3}</p>
<p>“Next, outside the door base should be drawn a red lotus, a vajra, a blue lotus, a banner, a flag, a parasol, a doorway, a chariot, an elephant, a horse, a bull, a buffalo, a swastika, a peacock, a goat, a ram, and a man of youthful appearance. They should be arranged in successive rows  fitting in with the threefold maṇḍala. {3.4}</p>
<p>“Then, in the southeastern direction, one should perform the fire kindling ritual using the one-syllable mantra and offer one hundred and eight oblations with sticks of the devil’s horsewhip plant smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. Then a welcome offering of flowers should be presented. Using the one-syllable mantra, one may also offer, whenever desired, a bali, sacrificial food, lamps, or incense or perform the summoning and the dismissing.{3.5}</p>
<p>“One should usher the supplicant into the maṇḍala. If he wants royal power, the maṇḍala should be drawn in the middle of a city; if he wishes for enjoyments, then near a banyan tree; if he wants a son, then near a lucky bean tree. If he desires a wife, horses, or elephants, then inside an elephant stable or a horse stable; if he has been bitten [by a snake], then at a pond or a place where nāgas live; if he is afflicted with a quartan, chronic, or any other fever, then near a solitary liṅga or to the south of a village; if he is possessed by rākṣasas, then in a cemetery or in an empty house; if he is possessed by piśācas, then near a beleric myrobalan tree or a castor oil plant; if he is possessed by any of the mātṛs, then at a crossroad or near a house where a male offspring has died; if he is possessed by brahmarākṣasas, then under a palm tree or a large sebesten tree. If he was fed poison, he should be given water incanted seven times with the one-syllable mantra and made to lie down in the middle of the maṇḍala—he will be released from the effects of the poison. {3.6}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the case of a woman or a man who seeks fame, one should draw the maṇḍala at a crossroad or on brahmins’ land. If it is a woman whose child has died, then it should be drawn near a fruit-bearing tree or a sap-filled tree. In the case of a childless woman, it should be drawn in the middle of a field of rice ready to harvest. For those who have contracted the three diseases or have been afflicted by others, it should be drawn at a crossing point or a similar place. In the case of severe illness, a maṇḍala that destroys rākṣasas should be drawn on a river island or a riverbank. Drawn on a mountaintop, the maṇḍala counters all diseases, in whatever form they may be. For the diseases caused by ḍākinīs, it should be drawn in a brahmin’s garden, an empty house,  a lonely spot, or a depression in the terrain. {3.7}</p>
<p>“In all rituals such as these, the maṇḍala should be drawn at midnight, or midday, or otherwise at any time. Employing this very one-syllable mantra, one should present a welcome offering of flowers to the deity and then dismiss him. Having done so, one should inundate the maṇḍala with water. This will provide strong protection to all those who are weary. {3.8}</p>
<p>“They will be freed from all illnesses</p>
<p>And will attain their desired goals.</p>
<p>One without a son will obtain a son,</p>
<p>And the unfortunate will meet with good fortune. {3.9}</p>
<p>“The destitute will obtain wealth</p>
<p>Through merely seeing the maṇḍala.</p>
<p>Anyone with faith in the ritual,</p>
<p>Whether it is a woman or a man,</p>
<p>Will meet, every time,</p>
<p>With whatever kind of good fortune they wish for.”{3.10}</p>
<p>This concludes the chapter on the maṇḍala procedure, the third in “The Root Manual of the Divine Youth Mañjuśrī,” an extensive bodhisattva textbook.</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Homage to the Buddha and all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī then looked at the entire realm of the Pure Abode and again directed his gaze at the great assembly gathered there. Prostrating at the feet of Śākyamuni, he smiled and said this to the Blessed One: {4.1}</p>
<p>“It is good fortune, O Blessed One, that there is a painting procedure, intended for the benefit of all beings, from the extensive chapters that produce a rain of desired results falling down from the Cloud of Dharma that arises from the accomplishment of sādhana methods of mantra practice. This procedure generates a vast amount of merit and creates the seed of perfect awakening; it also brings complete omniscience.{4.2}</p>
<p>“In short, it completely fulfills all wishes; it grants the complete acquisition of the fruits of all mantras; it brings about accomplishments that are fruitful and effective, as well as the complete fulfillment of bodhisattva conduct; it equips one with the armor of a great bodhisattva; and it overpowers and puts to flight the entire army of Māra. Please take pity on us, O Blessed One, and on all beings, and teach us this procedure.” {4.3}</p>
<p>Being thus addressed by the divine youth Mañjuśrī, Lord Śākyamuni said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Good, Mañjuśrī! It is good that you, acting for the benefit of many people, with compassion for the world, deem this topic to be worthy of asking the Tathāgata. Listen well and reflect upon it thoroughly. I will teach your painting procedure to you in full—the procedure that is the means for all sentient beings to accomplish their practice. I will teach it just as it was previously taught by all the tathāgatas, introducing and expounding it in the right order. I will teach it now. {4.4}</p>
<p>“To start, the maṇḍala master should bring cotton to a patch of ground free of impurities and have it cleaned by people who have taken up the samaya vows. When it has been cleaned, the maṇḍala master should incant it with the mantra, as given next, one hundred and eight times. {4.5}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas whose intentions are impeccable and who practice impeccable conduct. Homage to the sovereign king of kings who purifies and pacifies suffering, the tathāgata, the worthy one, the perfectly awakened one. The mantra is as follows:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, purify purify! You are the destroyer of all obstacle makers, one of great compassion, possessed of the form of divine youth! Transform, transform! Remember your samaya! Remain, remain! Huṁ huṁ, phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!{4.6}</p>
<p>“Then the maṇḍala master should procure a young girl, who has not yet had a sexual experience, born into a brahmin, kṣatriya, or vaiśya family. Those of a low-caste origin should be avoided. She should be physically unimpaired and beautiful in every limb. She should have obtained permission to take part in the ritual from her mother and father and should be observing the ritual fast. She should have developed bodhicitta and be compassionate. She should have a clear, light complexion without any discoloration. In short, she must have all the auspicious marks of a woman. On an auspicious day of the bright fortnight, having ascertained that the planets are astrologically auspicious and bright, in a clean, windless place that is free from smoke, fog, and clouds, having bathed the previously described girl, the maṇḍala master should dress her nicely in clean clothes  and perform the protection ritual employing the mantra as given next along with the great mudrā. He should mix some white sandalwood and saffron with water that is free of living organisms and, while the girl is drinking it, he should sprinkle her with this water, purified with the same mantra. {4.7}</p>
<p>“He should throw white sandalwood and saffron-scented water in the four cardinal directions, upward, downward, and in the four intermediate directions. Having blended white sandalwood, saffron, and camphor together, the master should offer it himself or have the practitioner do this. The following should be spoken three times: {4.8}</p>
<p>“ ‘May the blessed buddhas and the great bodhisattvas established on the tenth bodhisattva level bless the thread for making this cloth.’ ” {4.9}</p>
<p>“The blessed buddhas and the great bodhisattvas will subsequently give their attention to the ritual. While the master burns incense, at that time peacocks, curlews, wild geese, cranes, and ruddy geese—many beautiful birds who live on water or on land—will fly up into the air and utter their auspicious cries. The practitioner should then know, ‘My rite will bear fruit. The holy buddhas and the great bodhisattvas have blessed my canvas thread for me. My present life will be a happy one, and my mantra accomplishment will not be in vain.’ {4.10}</p>
<p>“The sounds of drums—big, medium, and small—conchs, lutes, flutes, cymbals, and tambourines will be heard. Women, boys, girls, and men—both real and imagined—will at that time spontaneously say the following:</p>
<p>“ ‘Victory is accomplished! Take the offering that has been offered! This is glorious and fruitful, with an opulence matching that of Śakra!’{4.11}</p>
<p>“They, and others too, will say similar words. Sounds of a bell or sounds of rejoicing may also be heard. Only then will the knowledge holder know  that the thread has been blessed by the holy buddhas and the great bodhisattvas, not in any other way. The accomplishment will not be futile. {4.12}</p>
<p>“But, on that occasion, they may also say harsh words, such as:</p>
<p>“ ‘Seize, devour, and cause others to devour! It is lost, lost completely. Alas! It is far, very far! It is gone!’ {4.13}</p>
<p>“They could say words such as these. Also, the monkeys, buffaloes, jackals, donkeys, cats, and other detestable humans and animals might utter their cries. The practitioner will then realize that he has not succeeded, and that his present life will be short. As an option, he can do the preliminary practice and repeat the procedure from the beginning up to seven times. After the seven performances of the ritual, even someone who has committed the five acts of immediate retribution will succeed. {4.14}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should then perform the protection ritual for the previously selected girl and have her sit on a bundle of kuśa grass. He should place her facing the east or north, get his sacrificial food, and feed it to her. Following this procedure, he should have her spin the cotton upon the bundle of kuśa grass that was prepared beforehand. {4.15}</p>
<p>“The thread, well spun and white, should be twisted together by a girl who has previously been trained. It should be well measured into units of one, three, five, eight, or up to sixteen palas or karṣas.The best would be of sixteen units. The middling would be of eight units. The next in rank would be of five units. In rites where the target is of minor significance, the thread should be of one unit. A mantra adept should use this scheme in all rites according to his ability.{4.16}</p>
<p>“From then onward,</p>
<p>Whatever bad karma one has previously committed</p>
<p>Will be destroyed in an instant,</p>
<p>As his mind focuses on the thread.{4.17}</p>
<p>“He should take this thread</p>
<p>And place it in a clean container.</p>
<p>Having placed it there,</p>
<p>He should cense it with an incense of camphor {4.18}</p>
<p>“Or other substances not derived from the bodies of living beings,</p>
<p>Such as saffron, sandalwood, and so forth.</p>
<p>He should worship it with fragrant flowers</p>
<p>Such as jasmine, champak, and others. {4.19}</p>
<p>“The mantra adept, familiar with all the rites,</p>
<p>Having recited the mantra as required, well focused,</p>
<p>Should place the thread in a clean place</p>
<p>For which the protection rite has been performed. {4.20}</p>
<p>“He should then go to a weaver</p>
<p>And pay him a fee of his choice.</p>
<p>The weaver should not be lacking any limbs,</p>
<p>Not be emaciated, and always delight in the pure Dharma. {4.21}</p>
<p>“He should not be afflicted with illnesses, not be too old,</p>
<p>And be free from coughing and asthma.</p>
<p>He should not be impotent,</p>
<p>And should be of a blameless origin.{4.22}</p>
<p>“He should be faultless,</p>
<p>Have no hump, and not be lame.</p>
<p>He must have all the auspicious marks</p>
<p>And be praiseworthy and good looking. {4.23}</p>
<p>“He should be pure in mind, virtuous in conduct,</p>
<p>And depend for his livelihood on a profession approved by the world.</p>
<p>The practitioner who seeks accomplishment in this ritual</p>
<p>Should request him to weave the best of cloths. {4.24}</p>
<p>“His assistants should be praiseworthy, of good caste,</p>
<p>Intelligent, and well trained</p>
<p>In weaving the best cloth</p>
<p>Of the highest quality.{4.25}</p>
<p>“For the highest rite, the mantra adept should follow the highest routine;</p>
<p>For the medium, he should follow the medium.</p>
<p>He should follow other routines</p>
<p>Whenever the deeds are low or insignificant, {4.26}</p>
<p>“Paying whatever price</p>
<p>The craftsman specifies.</p>
<p>At the first utterance of the craftsman</p>
<p>The mantra adept should {4.27}</p>
<p>“Promptly make the payment—</p>
<p>This is called the ‘heroes’ transaction,’</p>
<p>Since the mantra reciter pays</p>
<p>After a mere request, without bargaining. {4.28}</p>
<p>“This supreme and best of cloths</p>
<p>Swiftly produces accomplishment,</p>
<p>Fulfills all rites, is venerable,</p>
<p>And bestows divine and human happiness.</p>
<p>The perfectly awakened buddhas taught</p>
<p>That this was auspicious for all beings. {4.29}</p>
<p>“Then the knowledge holder should prescribe to the weaver the observance of a fast and, during an auspicious lunar asterism, on a bright day during the ‘fortnight of miracles’ when the planets have been ascertained as auspicious, or during another bright fortnight, in the spring, that best of seasons when mango trees are garlanded with blossoms and the best of trees are fully in bloom, in the morning when the sun has risen, he should give sacrificial food to the weaver who fits the previously described characteristics. He should dress him in clean clothes, tie a turban on his head, bathe and anoint him well, and smear his body with white sandalwood and saffron or some other such fragrance.  He should perfume the weaver’s mouth with camphor, cheer him up, and make sure that he is neither hungry nor thirsty. The knowledge holder should then thoroughly clean the weaving implements, the rope, and other tools, using clay and cow dung. Placing them in front, he should rinse them with the five products of a cow again and again. {4.30}</p>
<p>“Then, having rinsed them with water free of living organisms, he should ritually besprinkle them with white sandalwood and saffron. Having chosen a clean spot on the ground in a place free from noise and people, the practitioner should sit on a seat that is secluded, peaceful, and adorned with flowers. He should then throw white mustard seeds incanted one hundred and eight times with the purification mantra in the four cardinal directions, upward, downward, and in the four intermediate directions. Then, having cast mustard seeds at the weaver, he should form the great five-crested mudrā and tie his hair into a topknot. This will afford powerful protection. {4.31}</p>
<p>“If the cloth is going to be of the superior kind, it should be four cubits wide and eight cubits long; he should supply the weaver with enough material for these measurements. If the cloth is going to be of the medium kind, it should be two cubits wide and five cubits long. If it is to be of the smallest kind, it should have the width equal to the thumb-to-index-finger measurement of the Sugata, and the length of one cubit. Regarding these particular measurements, the thumb-to-index-finger measurement of Lord Buddha corresponds to the length of the forearm of a man from the central region—this is what is known as the Buddha’s thumb-to-index-finger measurement as a unit of length. The cloth is said to be of the authentic size when these measurements are used. {4.32}</p>
<p>“When the cloth is of the superior kind,</p>
<p>The superior accomplishment will arise, as taught by the most eminent of men.</p>
<p>The medium cloth is for those desiring royal status</p>
<p>After the sage has disappeared.{4.33}</p>
<p>“When the cloth is of the lowest quality, the accomplishment is said</p>
<p>To belong to the seekers of great prosperity</p>
<p>Who will attain the comforts of the three classes of gods and the asuras.</p>
<p>When middling, the accomplishment will be middling. {4.34}</p>
<p>“The cloth of the lowest quality should always be used</p>
<p>To accomplish the least important activities.</p>
<p>Any activity will be accomplished</p>
<p>And all substances always obtained. {4.35}</p>
<p>“What is taught in the cloth ritual will bring accomplishment</p>
<p>For people seeking good fortune.</p>
<p>Those who stray from the right procedure—</p>
<p>Even Śakra, the husband of Śacī—will not succeed. {4.36}</p>
<p>“Those, however, who follow the right procedure,</p>
<p>Even those of lowly birth,</p>
<p>Will swiftly succeed</p>
<p>In all rituals without effort. {4.37}</p>
<p>“This path has been taught</p>
<p>By the victorious ones and their foremost sons</p>
<p>To improve the lot of all beings</p>
<p>Suffering from poverty and lacking a protector. {4.38}</p>
<p>“The complete path to awakening</p>
<p>Has been explained by those who know the truth.</p>
<p>This path, the cause of awakening,</p>
<p>Is presented by means of the Mantra Vehicle. {4.39}</p>
<p>“Mantras will be accomplished without effort,</p>
<p>As will all mundane maṇḍalas.</p>
<p>The supramundane ones that have been taught</p>
<p>Will also be accomplished. {4.40}</p>
<p>“Those whose minds are set on awakening</p>
<p>Will always gain accomplishment.</p>
<p>As for those who are always hostile to the world,</p>
<p>Their accomplishment will not be taught in this manual. {4.41}</p>
<p>“The great being Mañjuśrī, the divine youth,</p>
<p>Always taught this accomplishment</p>
<p>In particular for those beings</p>
<p>Who set out in pursuit of awakening. {4.42}</p>
<p>“One can swiftly obtain this accomplishment in full</p>
<p>For the sake of fulfilling that which needs to be done.</p>
<p>The craftsman should therefore</p>
<p>Weave the cloth diligently, step by step, {4.43}</p>
<p>“Working in two sessions of four time units each day,</p>
<p>It will take him five or eight days of sixteen time units.</p>
<p>Working all day and all night,</p>
<p>The weaving will be completed quickly.{4.44}</p>
<p>“In the case of those who desire the accomplishment of the highest order</p>
<p>The cloth should be completed within a single day and night.</p>
<p>The craftsman should be continually supervised</p>
<p>To check whether he observes his purification practices. {4.45}</p>
<p>“He should walk away from his dwelling the required distance</p>
<p>To evacuate his bowels and bladder.</p>
<p>He should then bathe and wash his clothes,</p>
<p>Changing into the new ones. {4.46}</p>
<p>“Wearing white garments and a garland,</p>
<p>He should rinse his mouth repeatedly,</p>
<p>Anoint his body with white sandalwood,</p>
<p>And wipe his hands clean. {4.47}</p>
<p>“He should weave on with diligence,</p>
<p>Making a fine and blemish-free cloth.</p>
<p>Using the previously mentioned methods</p>
<p>Or other methods as taught by the victorious ones, {4.48}</p>
<p>“When the thoughtful and disciplined weaver</p>
<p>Who weaves the entire cloth</p>
<p>Creates it through the preceding rites</p>
<p>And completes it as described, {4.49}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should ensure, on an auspicious day,</p>
<p>That it is not too small but of the right size and even.</p>
<p>Then, during an auspicious bright fortnight,</p>
<p>He should invest it with a mantra.{4.50}</p>
<p>“Having spread out the cloth,</p>
<p>Adorned with knotted tassels,</p>
<p>He should fasten it onto bamboo sticks,</p>
<p>Then take it and go. {4.51}</p>
<p>“He should congratulate the craftsman at length,</p>
<p>Rewarding him with a substantial honorarium.</p>
<p>He should then go wherever he wishes,</p>
<p>Sticking by his rules of conduct and ritual observances. {4.52}</p>
<p>“He should worship the cloth with fragrant flowers</p>
<p>Then place it in a clean place</p>
<p>And perform the protection rite</p>
<p>Using the mantra. {4.53}</p>
<p>“To perform the protection rite</p>
<p>He should use the same mantra</p>
<p>With which he had earlier purified the cotton repeatedly.</p>
<p>The protection should be both for himself and the cloth. {4.54}</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, he of great valor,</p>
<p>Has been expressed in the form of mantra</p>
<p>In the past by many mantras</p>
<p>And by me as well again and again.{4.55}</p>
<p>“He, the very nature of mantra,</p>
<p>Pervades all mantras;</p>
<p>With great valor and efficacy,</p>
<p>He fulfills the aims of all mantras. {4.56}</p>
<p>“He takes a great diversity of forms</p>
<p>And serves as the cause for all manner of protection.</p>
<p>Foolish are the minds and behavior</p>
<p>Of beings living in Jambūdvīpa. {4.57}</p>
<p>“They are devoid of faith and perverted;</p>
<p>They follow mistaken conduct and are very greedy.</p>
<p>They are unable to accomplish the mantras,</p>
<p>Nor can they obtain any substances. {4.58}</p>
<p>“And so they wander</p>
<p>In the dark prison of saṃsāra.</p>
<p>However, if one has a pure mind,</p>
<p>Constant faith, and keen interest in the auspicious; {4.59}</p>
<p>“If one is constantly eager</p>
<p>To grasp and maintain all the mantras;</p>
<p>And if such a great being desires accomplishment</p>
<p>And has great perseverance and energy, {4.60}</p>
<p>“The mantras taught by the victorious ones</p>
<p>Will bring him results without effort.</p>
<p>But among those without faith,</p>
<p>The virtuous Dharma will not grow. {4.61}</p>
<p>“It is like a seed sown in salty soil,</p>
<p>Whose sprout will not bear fruit.</p>
<p>Faith is always the root of Dharma,</p>
<p>As has been taught by all those who show the true goal.</p>
<p>The accomplishment of mantra, as has always been taught,</p>
<p>Belongs to those disciplined for the sake of the Dharma. {4.62}</p>
<p>“Therefore, only a well-trained painter skilled in sādhana, or oneself if able to, should do the painting using uncontaminated paints.  The painter, having undergone the ritual procedure as previously described for preparing the weaver, and endowed with the auspicious marks and so forth should choose any bright paints of strong colors and execute the painting in detail. The painting may be commissioned or done by oneself adhering to the same procedure as before in the case of the weaver. {4.63}</p>
<p>“One should infuse the paints with camphor, saffron, sandalwood, and so forth, and then, burning incense, incant them with the very same mantra one hundred and eight times. One should bestrew the cloth with the blossoms of the ironwood tree, pannay tree, bulletwood tree, and the flowers of champak, Arabian jasmine, dhānuṣkārika jasmine, and royal jasmine. Then, sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass and facing east, with a settled mind and thoughts directed to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, one should take hold of a fine-tipped brush and, with a relaxed mind, commence the painting. {4.64}</p>
<p>“First one should paint the Tathāgata Śākyamuni, endowed with all of his excellent forms, his body marked with the thirty-two marks of a perfect man and adorned with the eighty minor characteristics. He sits on a jeweled lotus, his form surrounded by a halo of light to the distance of one fathom all around. He teaches the Dharma with a serene expression. {4.65}</p>
<p>“Beneath the great throne in the center, which consists of a lotus with a strong beryl stalk, are two nāga kings—Nanda and Upananda—who support the stalk. They should be painted in half-human, half-serpent form, looking at the Tathāgata and greeting him with their right hands. A lotus pond should be painted surrounding them that is filled with lotus leaves and flowers with opening buds and teeming with aquatic creatures such as birds, fish, and so forth. All the figures throughout it should be of exquisite form. {4.66}</p>
<p>“At the base of the stem of the Blessed One’s lotus spring several other lotus flowers, all growing progressively higher.  To his left, eight lotuses should be drawn with the figures of the eight great bodhisattvas seated upon them. {4.67}</p>
<p>“On the first lotus is Noble Mañjuśrī. His color is either whitish like the filaments of a lotus or golden like saffron. His form is that of a divine youth with the features of a young male child. On his head are five decorative locks of hair, and he is ornamented with all the adornments of a divine youth. In his left hand he holds a blue lotus, and with his right he salutes the Tathāgata, at whom he is directing his gaze. His bodily form is charming and peaceful, with a slightly laughing countenance, and a halo of blazing light encircling him. {4.68}</p>
<p>“The noble Candraprabha should be painted on the second lotus, also in the form of a divine youth. On the third should be Sudhana; on the fourth, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin; on the fifth, Gaganagañja; on the sixth, Kṣitigarbha; on the seventh, Anagha; and on the eighth, Sulocana. All of them should be painted as divine youths ornamented with the corresponding adornments. {4.69}</p>
<p>“To the right of the Blessed One there are another eight great bodhisattvas, all of them, except Maitreya, adorned with all types of jewelry. The noble Maitreya, who is next to the Blessed One, wears the attire of one who is celibate and has a topknot held up with a crown. His body is golden colored and his robes red ocher. His silken upper garment is red. His elegant form is marked with the triple line of an ascetic. Inside his left arm he carries a staff with a water jar suspended from it, and he has a black antelope skin thrown over his left shoulder. With his right hand he holds a rosary and greets the Tathāgata at whom he directs his gaze. His mental activity has its basis in mental absorption. {4.70}</p>
<p>“On the second lotus is Samantabhadra, his body the dark color of the beautyberry flower  and adorned with all types of jewelry. In his left hand he holds a wish-fulfilling gem and in his right a bel fruit, which he holds out in the boon-granting gesture. He should also be painted with a charming form. {4.71}</p>
<p>“On the third lotus is the noble Avalokiteśvara, white as the autumn moon and adorned with all types of jewelry. He wears a topknot and a crown and is invested with a white sacred thread. On his head is the noble omniscient Amitābha, sitting nestled in the ends of his matted hair—wondrous and beautiful in form and possessed of the ten powers. He should be painted holding a lotus in his left hand and displaying the boon-granting gesture with his right. His mental activity is grounded in mental absorption, and his body is surrounded by light. {4.72}</p>
<p>“On the fourth lotus is the noble Vajrapāṇi, with a vajra in his left hand. Golden in color, he is adorned with all kinds of jewelry. His right hand is clasped around a fruit and displays a boon-granting gesture. His charming form is of gentle aspect. His body is adorned with long and short pearl necklaces, and a pearl necklace serves as his sacred thread. He wears a crown studded with sparkling jewels, short trousers of fine cloth, and an upper garment of white silk. Just like the noble Avalokiteśvara and Samantabhadra, he wears a cloak used for visiting holy bathing places, and his appearance is as previously described. {4.73}</p>
<p>“On the fifth lotus is the noble Mahāmati; on the sixth, Śāntamati; on the seventh, Vairocana­garbha; and on the eighth, Apāyajaha—these bodhisattvas, too, should be depicted. They hold in their hands fruits and books, are adorned with all types of jewelry, and wear an upper garment and short trousers of fine silk. {4.74}</p>
<p>“Above them should be painted the eight pratyeka­buddhas,  attired in monks’ garb. Their robes are red ocher and their bodies possess the marks of a great being. They sit cross-legged on seats of jeweled lotuses in serene absorption, surrounded by halos of blazing light. While painting the picture, one should strew the cloth with fragrant flowers such as royal jasmine, Arabian jasmine, dhānuṣkārikā jasmine, blossoms of the pannay tree and ironwood tree, and so forth. {4.75}</p>
<p>“To the left of Lord Śākyamuni and above Noble Mañjuśrī one should paint a lofty palatial maṇḍala, decorated with many gems and adorned with the king of mountains. It has the shape of a mountain entirely covered with precious stones. There one should paint the eight blessed buddhas, as listed below. {4.76}</p>
<p>“The first, Ratnaśikhin, should be painted adorned with jewels the color of beryl and with an aura of light extending one fathom all around him. He shines in all directions with the glow of many exquisite jewels, such as rubies, sapphires, emeralds, beryls, and so forth. His body of a tathāgata has the soft color of the rising sun. He wears the yellow robes and upper garment of a monk, sits in the cross-legged posture, and expounds the Dharma. His outer garment is yellow. His body is armored with the thirty-two marks of a great being and is also adorned with the eighty minor marks. He is of peaceful appearance and in all aspects excellent. Thus should Tathāgata Ratnaśikhin be depicted. {4.77}</p>
<p>“The second, Tathāgata Saṃkusumita­rājendra, should be painted in golden color and richly bestrewn with flowers, such as the blossoms of the ironwood tree, bulletwood tree, and so forth. His gaze is directed at Noble Mañjuśrī. He is surrounded with light that forms a halo sparkling with the colors of precious jewels.{4.78}</p>
<p>“Tathāgata Śālendra­rāja should be painted as the third. He is of the color of lotus filaments and is expounding the Dharma. The fourth to be painted is Tathāgata Sunetra; the fifth is Duḥprasaha; the sixth is Vairocana, the Victorious One; the seventh, Bhaiṣajya­vaidūrya­rāja; and the eighth, Tathāgata Rājendra, the pacifier of all suffering. All of them should be depicted endowed with tathāgata forms of golden color, displaying the hand gesture of granting fearlessness. {4.79}</p>
<p>“Two gods from the realm of the Pure Abode should be painted among the clouds above the tathāgatas, each in an upper corner of the canvas. They should be depicted releasing a rain of flowers. Standing in the midst of space, they salute all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and the noble śrāvakas. {4.80}</p>
<p>“Beneath the pratyeka­buddhas should be painted the eight great śrāvakas, seated separately near the bodhisattvas’ heads. They are Elder Śāriputra, Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, Rāhula, Nanda, Bhadrika, and Kaphiṇa. {4.81}</p>
<p>“The eight pratyeka­buddhas are Gandhamādana, Candana, Upariṣṭa, Śveta, Sita, Ketu, Nemi, and Sunemi. All of them are beautiful, serene, and self-controlled. They and the great śrāvakas fold their hands in reverence, looking at the blessed Buddha Śākyamuni. {4.82}</p>
<p>“Above them should be painted two more gods, near to the other two gods of the Pure Abode. They hold a long, elegant canopy of fine cloth, spreading it above all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and noble śrāvakas. They should be depicted wearing celestial garlands and clothes. {4.83}</p>
<p>“Above the head of Lord Śākyamuni one should paint a bundle of jeweled threads, including strings of pearls, gems, rubies, sapphires, and so forth. On this bundle, there should be a well-arrayed canopy of silk, decorated all around with hanging strings of pearls. {4.84}</p>
<p>“Below the lotus seat of Lord Śākyamuni, near the base of Noble Mañjuśrī’s  feet and to the side of Upananda, the king of nāgas, one should paint a great jewel mountain, rising up from a lotus lake. The mountain is overgrown with jeweled sprouts, vines of coral, and jeweled trees; it abounds in gorges and hidden caves and is frequented by great sages and siddhas. {4.85}</p>
<p>“On the mountain’s summit one should paint Yamāntaka, Lord of Wrath, most terrible in form, holding a noose in his right hand and a staff in his left. He knits his brow and looks at Noble Mañjuśrī, awaiting orders. He has a ‘wolf’s belly’ and upwardly flowing hair. His body color is that of collyrium or a dark cloud. He has a reddish beard, prominent fangs, long nails, and red eyes. He is adorned with snakes coiling around his neck and clothed in tiger skin. Extremely fierce, he destroys all obstacles. One should thus paint Yamāntaka, Lord of Great Wrath, with flames blazing all around him. {4.86}</p>
<p>“Below this mountain, one should paint the practitioner sitting on a slab of stone, with his knees touching the ground, and with an incense censer in his hand. He holds the emblems consistent with his dress and form and acts in the attitude of obedience. He should be depicted with his gaze directed at Noble Mañjuśrī. {4.87}</p>
<p>“Near Nanda, the king of nāgas, and off to the right below Lord Śākyamuni, one should paint the great jewel king of mountains rising from a lotus lake, as previously described. This time one should paint it without Yamāntaka, Lord of Wrath; also it should be bestrewn with celestial flowers and located below the noble Avalokiteśvara. This tall and lofty mountain should be painted as made of ruby, with a single summit made of beryl in the shape of a sprout.{4.88}</p>
<p>“Resting there should be painted the goddess who is the compassion of the noble Avalokiteśvara embodied—the noble Tārā. She is adorned with all types of jewelry and wears a red bodice and brightly colored silken garments. Her whole body is adorned with feminine adornments.  In her left hand she holds a blue lotus. Her body color is golden and her waist slim, but not overly so. She is neither too young nor too old. Her mind is absorbed in meditation, and she is awaiting an order. Her body is slightly bent forward with her right hand displaying the boon-granting gesture, and so forth. She sits in a cross-legged posture, turning her gaze slightly toward Avalokiteśvara. She is surrounded by a halo of blazing light. {4.89}</p>
<p>“There, on the jeweled peak made of beryl, completely enclosed and shaded by a pannay tree whose branches are all covered in flowers with buds fully open, is the blessed Tārā. The tree’s overspread branches are bent down with fresh sprouts, in a variety of shapes, bright and colorful. The goddess Tārā should be painted looking ahead. {4.90}</p>
<p>“The goddess removes all obstacles</p>
<p>And is the ultimate destroyer of fear.</p>
<p>For the protection of the practitioner,</p>
<p>She should be painted as the virtuous granter of boons. {4.91}</p>
<p>“The goddess takes the female form</p>
<p>And arises, along with her ten powers, from compassion.</p>
<p>She should be painted granting the boon</p>
<p>Of good fortune to all beings. {4.92}</p>
<p>“The goddess is the mother of the divine youth—</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa of great splendor.</p>
<p>In order to completely remove</p>
<p>The practitioner’s every obstacle,{4.93}</p>
<p>“To ensure protection by the rulers of men,</p>
<p>And to bring prosperity, she should be installed on the canvas.</p>
<p>The supreme Lord of Wrath,</p>
<p>Situated at the top of his mountain,{4.94}</p>
<p>“Has been taught by the most excellent Victor and his sons</p>
<p>For the sake of destroying all obstacles.</p>
<p>Very terrifying, most venerable,</p>
<p>Very fierce, and of great splendor, {4.95}</p>
<p>“He is primed for restraining beings</p>
<p>Who are hostile to the teachings.</p>
<p>For the practitioner, however,</p>
<p>He is a remover of all obstacles. {4.96}</p>
<p>“Violent and of a wrathful disposition,</p>
<p>He is the mantra deity to be summoned.</p>
<p>Most terrible and frightening,</p>
<p>He wards off all who are cruel. {4.97}</p>
<p>“He brings under control the unsubmissive</p>
<p>Who commit evil and violent acts,</p>
<p>Whether they dwell in the sky, on earth,</p>
<p>In subterranean realms, or anywhere else. {4.98}</p>
<p>“He destroys all evildoers</p>
<p>Who oppose the teachings of the Sage.</p>
<p>Thus one should paint the cloth</p>
<p>Four sided, with four corners. {4.99}</p>
<p>“At the bottom edge of the cloth,</p>
<p>There is an area with rivers.</p>
<p>Throughout it one should paint nāgas, one by one,</p>
<p>With their distinctive hoods expanded. {4.100}</p>
<p>“Their pure, white bodies</p>
<p>Are half human in form.</p>
<p>Raising up their torsos,</p>
<p>Their hands are folded in constant reverence. {4.101}</p>
<p>“One with seven hoods, of great valor,</p>
<p>Ananta by name, is referred to as ‘great lord.’</p>
<p>Adorned with jewels and gems,</p>
<p>He directs his gaze at Tathāgata Śākyamuni. {4.102}</p>
<p>“Of very beautiful and charming form,</p>
<p>He is adorned with jewel ornaments.</p>
<p>Known as the great king of nāgas,</p>
<p>He should be painted with a garland of blazing light. {4.103}</p>
<p>“He exerts himself for the good of the entire world,</p>
<p>Fully engaged in applying the teachings of the Sage</p>
<p>In order to remove all obstacles.</p>
<p>One should paint him as dwelling in a river. {4.104}</p>
<p>“This is the supreme painting procedure</p>
<p>That was taught by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>It has been taught before in brief and at length</p>
<p>By the tathāgatas. {4.105}</p>
<p>“Any wise person who paints it</p>
<p>Will gain infinite merit.</p>
<p>The bad and dreaded karma</p>
<p>Accumulated over millions of eons {4.106}</p>
<p>“Will be annihilated the very moment</p>
<p>One beholds this painting here on earth.</p>
<p>Therefore, one must not withhold this painting</p>
<p>From those who have committed the five acts of immediate retribution {4.107}</p>
<p>“Or who are undisciplined or detestable,</p>
<p>Who commit all kinds of evil acts</p>
<p>While lost in the darkness of saṃsāra</p>
<p>And dragged from birth to birth. {4.108}</p>
<p>“Simply beholding the painting will bear fruit for them—</p>
<p>So it was taught by the lords of sages.</p>
<p>As soon as they see it, that very moment</p>
<p>They will be freed from their evil. {4.109}</p>
<p>“What need then to speak of those who maintain purity</p>
<p>In their body and in their speech,</p>
<p>Who perform their recitations</p>
<p>And are diligent in relying on mantra?{4.110}</p>
<p>“The merit that has been accumulated by the totality of beings</p>
<p>Through religious worship over a million eons</p>
<p>Will be obtained by a practitioner of mantra</p>
<p>Who does this painting here on earth. {4.111}</p>
<p>“Buddhas—including the pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>And the foremost sons of the victorious ones—</p>
<p>Will come in numbers equal to the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā,</p>
<p>Whatever their number is said to be. {4.112}</p>
<p>“Merely upon seeing this painting</p>
<p>A person will gain the same merit</p>
<p>As those pratyeka­buddhas and śrāvakas of the world</p>
<p>Who make large numbers of offerings. {4.113}</p>
<p>“Whoever simply describes it,</p>
<p>Makes offerings to it, or rejoices in it</p>
<p>Will certainly accomplish the mantras</p>
<p>That are employed in every rite. {4.114}</p>
<p>“Whatever worldly mantras have been taught</p>
<p>By the victorious ones, the most excellent of men,</p>
<p>Or their pupils, the śrāvakas, or the pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>Or the divine bodhisattvas, the great beings,</p>
<p>All these mantras will be accomplished</p>
<p>In front of this foremost of all paintings.” {4.115}</p>
<p>This concludes the fourth chapter, the first in the detailed section on the procedure of cloth painting, from “The Root Manual Mañjuśrī,” the Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>Now, Lord Śākyamuni, looking at the entire assembly, spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, yet another procedure from your ritual of cloth painting—the medium one. I will teach it now, so listen well and duly reflect upon it. {5.1}</p>
<p>“First, to produce the medium painting, thread should be used as previously described, following the same procedure as before. The work should be done by craftsmen who have been trained beforehand, applying the same measurements as the previous cloth. Just as before, the cloth should be of excellent quality, white, tightly woven, and thoroughly clean and have fringe tassels. The painting should then be executed using uncontaminated paints free of hairs, dust, or other debris, with everything done just as before, except for the sizes and forms of the painted figures. {5.2}</p>
<p>“First one should paint the realm of the Pure Abode, its form beautiful in every respect, abounding in things made of jewels, and adorned with garlands of white pearls. Portrayed in the middle should be Lord Śākyamuni, sitting on the lion throne expounding the Dharma and excellent in every aspect. {5.3}</p>
<p>“To his right is Noble Mañjuśrī, the color of lotus filaments, saffron,  or the sun, with a blue lotus near his left shoulder. With the palms of his hands folded in reverence, he looks toward Lord Śākyamuni. He has the form of a divine youth, with a gentle smile on his face, and his head is adorned with a crown of five decorative locks of hair. He is ornamented with the adornments of a young boy and inclines his head toward his right knee. {5.4}</p>
<p>“To the left of Lord Śākyamuni is the noble Avalokiteśvara, white as the autumn moon and painted just as he was described before, but this time fanning the Blessed One with a yak-tail whisk. To his left, arranged one next to the other, are the noble Maitreya, Vajrapāṇi, Mahāmati, Śāntamati, Gaganagañja, and Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin. They should be painted as before and adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {5.5}</p>
<p>“Situated above them the eight blessed buddhas should be painted in a standing position, displaying the boon-granting gesture with their right hands, their bodies covered in the yellow robes of a monk and an upper cloak. With their left hands they hold the corner of their robes. The well-fitting robes are yellowish with a slightly red hue. They are surrounded with halos of light and are excellent in every aspect. The blessed buddhas that should be portrayed are the tathāgatas Saṃkusumita­rājendra, Ratnaśikhin, Śikhin, Viśvabhuk, Krakucchanda, Bakagrīvin, Kāśyapa, and Sunetra. {5.6}</p>
<p>“To the right of the Blessed One and near Noble Mañjuśrī should be depicted the great assembly. The eight great śrāvakas and eight pratyeka­buddhas should be painted exactly as before, except that the noble Mahā­maudgalyāyana and Śāriputra are standing up and fanning Lord Śākyamuni with a yak-tail whisk. {5.7}</p>
<p>“The gods from the realm of the Pure Abode, Śakra, the lord of gods, and Suyāma, as well as the gods from the heavens of Tuṣita, Sunirmita, Śuddha, Vimala, Sudṛśa, Atapas, and Ābhāsvara should also be included. In addition, Brahmā Sahāmpati and the gods from the Akaniṣṭha heaven should be included. These and other gods who dwell in the realm of form and the realm of desire should be painted arranged in sequence, near to Noble Mañjuśrī. They should be painted arranged in tiers above the assembly with their respective features and dress. {5.8}</p>
<p>“Below the lion throne of the Blessed One, a great mountain should be painted rising from a great ocean and extending up to the edges of the canvas. In one corner of the canvas should be depicted the practitioner in the same form and dress as in real life. He should be depicted with his head inclined toward his knees and holding an incense holder in his hand. On the same jewel mountain, below Noble Mañjuśrī, is Yamāntaka, Lord of Wrath. He should be painted as previously described. {5.9}</p>
<p>“To the left of the Blessed One, below his lion throne, and near to the soles of the noble Avalokiteśvara’s feet, the Goddess Tārā should be painted sitting on that jewel mountain. She should be depicted exactly as previously described. The canvas should be strewn all over with flowers, such as champak, fragrant blue lotus, royal jasmine, Arabian jasmine, dhānuṣkārīka jasmine, and blossoms of the pannay tree, ironwood tree, and so forth. {5.10}</p>
<p>“And above, in the upper two corners, two gods should be painted releasing a great flood of flowers. They each have variegated, bright forms and rest within rain clouds in the midst of space. They should be depicted as white and flying. {5.11}</p>
<p>“This painting, which is called ‘medium,’</p>
<p>Is produced for the sake of good fortune.</p>
<p>For people here on earth</p>
<p>It brings middling accomplishments. {5.12}</p>
<p>“Any bad karma previously accumulated</p>
<p>By one wandering in saṃsāra</p>
<p>Will be destroyed instantly</p>
<p>Through merely seeing this painting in this life. {5.13}</p>
<p>“Circling throughout the five destinies,</p>
<p>Deluded people do not know this.</p>
<p>Those, however, who have seen</p>
<p>This painting of Mañjughoṣa in its medium version,{5.14}</p>
<p>“Even if they commit offenses</p>
<p>Such as the five acts of immediate retribution,</p>
<p>Even if they lack morality, they will succeed</p>
<p>At the various mantras that have been taught. {5.15}</p>
<p>“Having done their recitation</p>
<p>They will swiftly gain accomplishment.</p>
<p>The sick will be freed from their illness,</p>
<p>The poor will obtain wealth,</p>
<p>The childless will obtain sons</p>
<p>When they behold the medium painting. {5.16}</p>
<p>“As soon as they see it,</p>
<p>They will obtain merit great and vast.</p>
<p>Such a person will certainly come to partake</p>
<p>In the happiness of gods and humans</p>
<p>And will definitely attain buddhahood</p>
<p>At the end of this birth.{5.17}</p>
<p>“Through merely drawing or describing it,</p>
<p>Likewise through worshiping it, making copies of it,</p>
<p>Viewing it, or touching it,</p>
<p>One will be freed from all negativity. {5.18}</p>
<p>“So also, through requesting this painting of great splendor,</p>
<p>Or requesting the instructions thereof,</p>
<p>One will obtain a fruitful life</p>
<p>And swiftly win happiness. {5.19}</p>
<p>“It is not possible to express in words,</p>
<p>Not even in millions of infinite eons,</p>
<p>The merit and its results one would obtain</p>
<p>Through merely seeing this painting.” {5.20}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed fifth chapter, the second in the detailed section on the procedure of cloth painting, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>Now, Lord Śākyamuni again addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, yet another secret cloth-painting procedure, a third type, referred to as ‘smallest,’ by the means of which all beings can effortlessly win accomplishment. {6.1}</p>
<p>“Following the procedures as previously described, skilled craftsmen should prepare a cloth one width of the Buddha’s hand across that is in the same four-sided shape as before. The painting should then be done with the paints as previously described. {6.2}</p>
<p>“First one should paint Noble Mañjuśrī, sitting on a lion throne with the form, as before, of a young boy expounding the Dharma.  He should be painted as having a charming form that radiates light. To his left, the noble Samantabhadra stands on a dais of precious stone, with his right hand extended forth holding a yak-tail whisk and his left hand holding a wish-fulfilling gem. As before, he should be painted in the dark blue color of the beautyberry flower. To the right of Noble Mañjuśrī stands the noble Avalokiteśvara on a dais of precious stone. As before, he has a yak-tail whisk in his [right] hand and a lotus in his left. He should be drawn with his form haloed in blazing light. {6.3}</p>
<p>“Below Mañjuśrī’s lion throne should be painted a golden-colored mountain, extending down to the edge of the canvas. In the corner at the edge of the canvas, below the lion throne of Noble Mañjuśrī and to his right, Yamāntaka, the Lord of Wrath, should be painted with the same details as before. The practitioner should be painted as before, holding an incense holder. {6.4}</p>
<p>“Above Noble Mañjuśrī should be painted Tathāgata Saṃkusumita­rājendra, sixteen fingers tall, sheltering in a cave on a jeweled mountain. Its ten peaks should be drawn to resemble palaces. Around the perimeter of the cloth one should draw a ring of mountains. Above, perched on the front slopes of the mountains located in the two upper corners of the cloth, are two divine sons from the realm of the Pure Abode, named Śuddha and Viśuddha, who scatter heaps of flowers that float in arrays. They should be painted [with the same details] as before. The painting should be drawn with various flowers placed all around it. {6.5}</p>
<p>“The entire threefold description</p>
<p>Has now been given.</p>
<p>The painting called ‘smallest’</p>
<p>Is the best for minor rites. {6.6}</p>
<p>“Whatever evil has been committed or caused to be committed,</p>
<p>All this terrible karma,</p>
<p>Accumulated over thousands of eons,</p>
<p>Will be purified through merely seeing this painting.{6.7}</p>
<p>“As soon as this painting is seen,</p>
<p>At that very moment the karma will be purified.</p>
<p>A wise person who paid respects</p>
<p>To thousands of millions of buddhas</p>
<p>“Will not obtain even one sixteenth of the merit</p>
<p>Obtained through merely seeing this smallest painting. {6.8}</p>
<p>“A wise man will obtain the same merit</p>
<p>By merely looking at this smallest painting</p>
<p>As he would obtain by worshiping</p>
<p>All the protector buddhas.</p>
<p>In this life he will thus perform</p>
<p>Meritorious acts leading to good fortune. {6.9}</p>
<p>“However many mantras</p>
<p>Have been taught by the sages Brahmā and Indra;</p>
<p>By Vainateya, Varuṇa,</p>
<p>Āditya, or Kubera; {6.10}</p>
<p>“By all the rākṣasas, Dhanada and so forth;</p>
<p>By the lordly dānavas or mahoragas;</p>
<p>By Soma, Vāyu, Yama, and so forth—</p>
<p>Any that have been taught by Viṣṇu or Śiva—</p>
<p>All these mantras brought here before this painting</p>
<p>Would be accomplished. {6.11}</p>
<p>“One should always perform pacifying</p>
<p>And enriching rites in this way.</p>
<p>Violent acts ought to be shunned,</p>
<p>As they have been condemned by the best of victors.” {6.12}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed sixth chapter in “The Root Manual of Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter contains the third procedure, that of the “smallest” painting.</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>Now Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, rose from his seat, circumambulated Lord Śākyamuni three times clockwise and, having prostrated at his feet, said this to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Good! It is good that you, the blessed one, the tathāgata, the worthy one, the perfectly awakened one, gave this Dharma discourse in such a clear way for the benefit, the welfare, and the happiness of all who observe their vidyā vows and in order to show your compassion for the world. You exemplified the bodhisattvas’ skill in means with this particular method that takes them higher than nirvāṇa and, with their continuous dedication to the goal of awakening, accomplishes their conduct consistent with all the goals of the mantras. This will promote the spread of this secret mantra among all people. {7.1}</p>
<p>“In the future, when the teachers of the world have entered nirvāṇa and the sun of the tathāgatas has set—when their lineages have ended and all the buddhafields are empty of all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, noble śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas; when the inhabitants of the world have become blind with ignorance; when the noble eightfold path has been cut and the medicine of all the vidyā mantras that are like precious gems is lost; when the world spheres have gone dark, devoid of good people—at that time, beings will be lazy because of lack of interest; they will lack faith, will be willfully destructive, and will not rely on spiritual friends. They will be deceitful and treacherous, and they will act like rogues. {7.2}</p>
<p>“Such people, when hearing this Dharma discourse, will become frightened. Indulging in idleness and apathy, they will lack faith. Seeking sensual enjoyments, they will lack conviction. Delighting in wrong views, they will generate a lot of negativity. Rejecting the true Dharma, they will move from one terrible state to one even worse, bound for Avīci Hell. For the sake of those suffering like this, to enthrall the unsubmissive and, once they are enthralled, to grant them fearlessness, please muster your skill in means, O Blessed One, and teach them the procedure of painting involving mantras if you think that the time is right.” {7.3}</p>
<p>Then Lord Śākyamuni applauded Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Good, Mañjuśrī! It is good that you ask the Tathāgata about this matter. There is, Mañjuśrī, your most secret and detailed teaching on another procedure of cloth painting, with its associated conduct and practice of the vidyā observances. It includes the supreme and most secret meaning of the mantras of the ultimate essence—the great meaning that is the foundation of all mantras. {7.4}</p>
<p>“These six six-syllable mantras of the ultimate essence will, at that time, lead to an accomplishment without a doubt. I too will now teach what was previously taught by seven hundred and sixty million buddhas in order to tame such beings, to help them develop the skill in means, to cause them to take up the practice of the mantra, and to invariably bring them to perfect awakening. Focusing on the people of the future, listen well and reflect on the meaning thoroughly. I will now tell you, so what are they?” {7.5}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then pronounced the mantras:</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyārthe jaya.</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyaśeṣe sva.</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyeyanayaḥ.</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyaniṣṭheyaḥ.</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyeya namaḥ.</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyeda namaḥ.{7.6}</p>
<p>“These six mantras of yours, Mañjuśrī, each numbering six syllables, are of great power and equal in their great potency. They are the supreme heart mantras that bring the highest accomplishment, as if they originated from the Buddha himself. They have been proclaimed by every buddha for the benefit of all beings. They involve and activate the samaya and are suitable for all types of activity. They are signposts for the road to awakening and are the most important mantras of the Tathāgata family. They can be employed in all three levels of ritual, the highest, the medium, and the lowest. They bring the ripening of the fruit of virtuous karma. They will lead to accomplishment at the time when the Buddha’s teaching has disappeared. {7.7}</p>
<p>“For those who will have succeeded in finding, for the sake of protection, a true Dharma guide, these mantras will, even through only basic application, accomplish the goals of kingship, good fortune, and great powers. They will swiftly lead them to accomplishment at that time and juncture. Therefore, these supreme heart mantras should be accomplished even if it were only out of curiosity. In short, in whatever way they are employed, they will lead to corresponding accomplishments. The painting procedure involving these mantras will now be presented in brief.{7.8}</p>
<p>“At that time, during the terrible period of five degenerations, beings will have very little merit. They will be petty, with short lifespans and little happiness. Being weak in diligence, they will not even be able to begin the very elaborate rites for the painting procedures. It is for their benefit that I will teach a very short procedure. {7.9}</p>
<p>“First, one should purchase thread with due care, one pala or half a pala in weight, and commission a weaver to make a cloth one cubit long and half a cubit across, together with a fringe. Alternatively, one should obtain a different, new piece of cloth that is free from hairs, measuring—as one prefers—two, four, six, five, ten, or eight cubits from top to bottom, and very white, and one should have the painter do the painting according to one’s wish. {7.10}</p>
<p>“It should be painted using uncontaminated paints infused with sandalwood, camphor, and saffron. First one should mix together sandalwood, camphor, and saffron into a homogenous substance and blend this with water free of living organisms and impurities. One should soak the cloth in a vessel with this mixture, cover it well with a lid, and leave it for three days. Then, having performed the protection rite, in a clean place, having ritually purified oneself, during the bright fortnight, on the full moon day, one should sit on a bundle of kuśa grass in front of the vessel with the cloth in it and, facing the east, recite the words of the following mantra one hundred and eight times: {7.11}</p>
<p>“Oṁ he he! O blessed one with many forms and the divine eye, look after me, look! Remember your samaya! O great bodhisattva with the form of a divine youth, why do you delay? Hūṁ hūṁ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā!{7.12}</p>
<p>“Having recited this mantra, one should go to sleep right then. While asleep, one will receive a sign whether the procedure will be successful or not. Upon awakening, one should commission the painting without delay if one’s dreams indicated success. If the dreams conveyed no sign of success, one should take the cloth out of the vessel and dry it in the sun. When dry, one should again place it in a different new vessel. One should keep it well hidden, and also do the protection rite over it. Then, choosing whichever among the six-syllable heart mantras given previously one wishes, recite its syllables one hundred thousand times. One will then be able to swiftly accomplish the cloth-painting procedure. {7.13}</p>
<p>“To begin, one should take this cloth,  and, during the prātihāra fortnight, or any day during the bright fortnight when the stars are auspicious, and during an auspicious lunar asterism, on a night augured as favorable by the cries of auspicious birds, at midnight, one should have the painter do the painting. This should be done in a clean place, by a painter who is observing the ritual fast and burning an incense of camphor.{7.14}</p>
<p>“The painter should first paint Noble Mañjuśrī with the form of a young boy, his hair in five locks, and dressed with all the adornments of a boy. Golden in color, he wears short trousers and a shirt of blue silk. He expounds the Dharma while sitting on a lion throne in the cross-legged posture with his right foot placed on a jeweled footstool and his left on the seat of the lion throne. Adorned with all types of jewelry, he is of charming appearance. Smiling slightly, he is directing his gaze at the practitioner. {7.15}</p>
<p>“On his right side should be painted the noble Samantabhadra, waving a white yak-tail whisk. He is of the dark blue color of the beautyberry flower. In his left hand he holds a wish-fulfilling gem. He is beautiful in every limb and adorned with all types of jewelry. He wears short trousers of blue silk and is invested with the sacred thread made of a garland of pearls. He should be painted standing on a white lotus. {7.16}</p>
<p>“The noble Avalokiteśvara, white as the autumn moon and wearing short trousers of blue silk, should be painted to left side of Noble Mañjuśrī. Beautiful in his every limb and adorned with all types of jewelry, he is invested with the sacred thread made of a garland of pearls. He holds a white lotus in his left hand, and with his right he holds a white yak-tail whisk with a golden handle, which he waves. Peaceful in form, he, just like the noble Samantabhadra, directs his gaze at Noble Mañjuśrī. Both of them should be painted standing on white lotuses.{7.17}</p>
<p>“Next, three lotuses spring from a single stalk. On the pericarp of the middle, primary lotus is the lion throne of Noble Mañjuśrī and his jeweled footstool. On the second lotus the noble Samantabhadra stands on a white lotus seat. On the third lotus is the noble Avalokiteśvara. The beautiful, emerald-like stalk  rises from Anavatapta Lake, which is covered in lotus buds with leaves, half-opened lotuses, and lotuses in full bloom. This lotus stalk is supported by two nāga kings, Nanda and Upananda. {7.18}</p>
<p>“These two nāga kings should be painted as white, each of them adorned with seven hoods. Their bodies, adorned with all types of jewelry, are half human, and the other half is distinguished by the coils of a snake. With their [lower] bodies submerged in water, they direct their gaze at Noble Mañjuśrī. They are shaded with parasols decorated with jewels. {7.19}</p>
<p>“In the right corner of the cloth, on the margins below the great lake, the practitioner should be painted looking at the orb of Noble Mañjuśrī’s face. He holds an incense holder in his hand and inclines his head toward his knee. He should be depicted with all the respective details of dress and colors.{7.20}</p>
<p>“Above Noble Mañjuśrī, in the two corners at the edge of the cloth, two divine sons wearing garlands and holding garlands of flowers should be painted. They float nestled within clouds and release a great flood of flowers. Both are very beautiful. Blossoms of the ironwood tree and so forth should be painted strewn all around the cloth. One may create this painting, presided over by the three forms, however one desires.{7.21}</p>
<p>“They may be painted as the practitioner pleases, but these three figures must be included—the noble Mañjuśrī expounding the Dharma and the noble Samantabhadra and Avalokiteśvara, both of whom are painted with yak-tail whisks in their hands. Optionally, other forms may be added as desired, arranged according to their respective places. Whatever forms the practitioner finds agreeable, these forms may be painted. {7.22}</p>
<p>“Noble Mañjuśrī should always be painted in the middle, with the noble Avalokiteśvara and Samantabhadra on either side. The other forms, however, can be painted as preferred. One can also use any piece of cloth as available, which could be one vitasti or one cubit in size and either do the painting oneself or have it done by any painter whether he observes the fast or not, has faith or not, is pure or impure, or of good or bad morals.  If, however, the practitioner does the painting himself, he must certainly first complete the preparatory rites, have faith, and have given rise to bodhicitta. {7.23}</p>
<p>“In this way the mantras will be accomplished,</p>
<p>But not for those who commit evil.</p>
<p>Accordingly, once faith has been developed,</p>
<p>The mantra deities will be accomplished.{7.24}</p>
<p>“The mantra kings will be accomplished through this ritual</p>
<p>Only by those who have faith, not otherwise,</p>
<p>Because faith is the supreme vehicle</p>
<p>Traveled in by the spiritual guides themselves. {7.25}</p>
<p>“For a person without faith</p>
<p>The white Dharma will not grow,</p>
<p>Just like green shoots</p>
<p>From seeds burnt by fire. {7.26}</p>
<p>“But if an ordinary person is confirmed in faith</p>
<p>And has begun working toward awakening,</p>
<p>He will accomplish the deities.</p>
<p>If he has no faith, he will not.</p>
<p>In particular, he will not</p>
<p>Accomplish any mantras.{7.27}</p>
<p>“Whatever worldly deities there are,</p>
<p>And whatever are beyond this world,</p>
<p>All of them, free from stain,</p>
<p>Will be accomplished by those with faith.{7.28}</p>
<p>“Swiftly will they gain accomplishment,</p>
<p>And their awakening is certain, if they direct their minds to it.</p>
<p>No attainment is said to arise for the others</p>
<p>Who have turned from this teaching. {7.29}</p>
<p>“The painting procedures—the small, the special,</p>
<p>And the middle—have now been taught.</p>
<p>Presently, I will teach the practice</p>
<p>That accomplishes all activities.” {7.30}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed seventh chapter, which is the detailed fourth chapter on the cloth-painting procedure, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“The full topic of the cloth-painting procedure, Mañjuśrī, has now been taught by me for the benefit of those beings you foretold. They will succeed even with little skillful means. For their benefit I will now teach a sādhana method classified according to the type of activity, describing at length its different virtues. Listen to it well,  and reflect upon it thoroughly. I will speak for the benefit of all beings.”{8.1}</p>
<p>The divine youth Mañjuśrī, in turn, said to the Blessed One, “Good! It is good, O Blessed One, that you will give this eloquent exposition that illuminates our incisive meditation and causes the qualities of mantra practice to fully manifest. So do teach this method, Blessed One, if you think that the time is right. Do so out of compassion for us.” {8.2}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni looked then at the entire assembly and smiled. At that moment rays of blue, yellow, and translucent crystalline light issued from the mouth of Lord Śākyamuni. As soon as these rays issued forth, they illuminated the entire assembly and dimmed the worldly realm of the great trichiliocosm, including the abodes of all the māras. This included the light of the entire multitude of stars, celestial bodies, mountain ranges, and the moon and the sun, those two luminaries of great power and might, which were also dimmed by the light of Śākyamuni’s rays. They lost their radiance and did not illuminate the worlds. They did not shine and appeared dark. The rays dimmed also the jewel light of all gems, mantras, and medicines and then disappeared back into Lord Śākyamuni’s mouth. {8.3}</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the great being, was present at that time in the midst of this great gathering. Seated, he rose from his seat in his beautiful form pleasing to beings, prostrated at the Blessed One’s feet, and said this to him:</p>
<p>“It is not without a cause or a reason that the blessed buddhas smile. What is the cause, Blessed One, what is the reason for your smile?” {8.4}</p>
<p>Being thus asked, the Blessed One said to Bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, “It is so, Vajrapāṇi, it is so. It is exactly as you say. The smile of the tathāgatas does not happen without a cause or a reason. There is a cause,  there is a reason: future beings will take up and follow this king of the lords of sūtras, this root manual of Mañjuśrī, which arose out of the tenth bodhisattva level, Cloud of Dharma—a collection of skillful methods such as ritual practices that involve knowledge-vidyās and practicing the right conduct. Future beings will study this manual in full, memorize it, spread it by word of mouth, and put their faith in it. {8.5}</p>
<p>“Having written it down in the form of a book, they will worship it with sandalwood powder, ointments, incense, flower garlands, parasols, flags and banners, or other different means, in particular with the music of various instruments and cymbals. Through that they will attain a continuous mental state of inner rejoicing that makes their bodily hair bristle with joy. Learning about the power and efficacy of vidyās, they will be thrilled, rejoice, and will take up the right conduct. I predict that all of them will become blessed buddhas, established in supreme, perfect awakening. It is for this and no other reason that the victorious ones smile. {8.6}</p>
<p>“To start, one who observes his samaya of, who has completed the preparatory rites for, and who has been ritually initiated into this king of manuals should choose either the root mantra, heart mantra, subsidiary heart mantra, or another mantra, whether of one syllable or another one as desired and go to a large forest. There one should recite the mantra three million times, living on fruits, water, roots, or leaves. This constitutes the preliminary practice. {8.7}</p>
<p>“One should then climb to the top of a mountain and position the superior painting so that it faces the west. Then, sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass and facing east, one should offer, below the painting, one hundred thousand white lotuses smeared with white sandalwood and saffron to Lord Śākyamuni and all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and noble śrāvakas. One should burn camphor incense according to one’s means and make offerings to the gods and nāgas  of whatever flowers are available. {8.8}</p>
<p>“Then, at the midnight hour, on a bright full moon night, the completely full moon of the prātihāra fortnight, one should dig, in front of the painting, a fire pit in the shape of a lotus and kindle the fire using white sandalwood sticks. One should blend together saffron and camphor and offer it into the fire one thousand and eight times, [or as many times] as one can. [In this way] one becomes ritually protected. {8.9}</p>
<p>“Then rays of light emanate from Lord Śākyamuni, encircle the painting, and envelop it with blazing light. The practitioner, in a form pleasing to beings, should then circumambulate the painting three times clockwise, bow to all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and noble śrāvakas, and take the painting into his hands.{8.10}</p>
<p>“As soon as one grasps the end of the cloth where the practitioner had been painted earlier, one will fly upward. In the snap of a finger, one will ascend to the realm of Brahmā. One will reach the world sphere called Kusumāvatī, where dwells Tathāgata Saṃkusumita Rājendra. There he upholds, maintains, and expounds the Dharma. One will see there Noble Mañjuśrī in person and will hear his Dharma discourse. One will also see many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas and attend upon them. One will live for one thousand great eons, enjoying freedom from old age and death. {8.11}</p>
<p>“The painting also remains there and is blessed by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas; one can clearly feel the blessing. One will be able to visit hundreds of thousands of buddhafields, display hundreds of thousands of bodies, and develop many magical powers. Noble Mañjuśrī will become one’s spiritual friend, and one will be destined to attain awakening.” {8.12}</p>
<p>This concludes the eighth chapter of this extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter constitutes the detailed first chapter on the ritual involving the supreme sādhana method.</p>
<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni addressed the hosts of gods who were sitting among the entire assembly:</p>
<p>“Esteemed friends! Please listen to my discourse about the method for accomplishing the conduct, maṇḍala, and mantra of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. Hear this great vidyārāja—the supremely secret and sublime heart mantra that was taught by all the tathāgatas for the sake of protecting the practitioner—by the uttering of which all mantras are uttered. {9.1}</p>
<p>“This vidyārāja, O hosts of gods, is inviolable. With this vidyārāja even Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, can be summoned, enthralled, and made to comply. Why say more? There are, O bodhisattvas, other mantras, both worldly and transcendental, but this unique mantra of great valor and power is said to be the best of all mantras—it can destroy all obstacles. Among all one-syllable mantras, only this one is called the syllable.{9.2}</p>
<p>“This single syllable fulfills all purposes and accomplishes every task; it nullifies all the mantras of evildoers and removes all sins; it makes all the other mantras effective; it brings that which is virtuous. It surpasses all other worldly and transcendental mantras. It is the impeccable essence of all the tathāgatas that fulfills all wishes. Which mantra is this? It is kḷlhīṁ.{9.3}</p>
<p>“Friends, this most secret vidyārāja called One Syllable can be employed in all rites. No being  may transgress it; it cannot be assailed by any spirit; it constitutes the auspiciousness of all the buddhas; it makes all mantras effective; it is the master of the worlds; it is the lord of all the lords of wealth; it is the love for all those who hate; it awakens the compassion of all beings; and it is the remover of all obstacles. In short, whatever it is employed in, that very thing it will accomplish. It can perform tasks even when it is not fully mastered. {9.4}</p>
<p>“Whomever one touches while reciting this mantra will become enthralled. If one wears incanted clothes, one will obtain good fortune. If one bites an incanted tooth stick, one will get rid of a toothache. If one bites an incanted tooth stick from the white oleander tree, food will be found without one’s having to ask for it. {9.5}</p>
<p>“If one has eye pain, one should grind sea salt, incant it seven times, and apply it to the eye. This will remove the pain. If one has an earache, one should take a mushroom that has grown in elephant dung while it thundered, wrap it in a leaf of kedhuka, and cook it over a low fire until it is well cooked. Having then added a lukewarm solution of sea salt, one should incant the decoction seven times and pour it into the ear. The pain will be assuaged at that moment. {9.6}</p>
<p>“If, at the time of giving birth, a woman is having a difficult delivery and is overcome with pain, one should grind the root of Malabar nut with water that is free of living organisms and smear it over the navel area. She will give birth with ease. If a person with a splinter in his flesh drinks old ghee incanted one hundred and eight times, or smears it over the affected area, the splinter will come out. {9.7}</p>
<p>“In the case of indigestion with vomiting and dysentery, one should incant seven times some sochal salt, sea salt, or other type of salt, and eat it. One will be free from this disease the same day and will become well. In the case of the twofold dysentery or a sudden dysentery, one should mash the fruits of citron with water that is free of living organisms and has been incanted once or more. By this method one will be freed from the unpleasant symptoms. {9.8}</p>
<p>“In the case of a barren woman, or a woman who wants but is unable to conceive, one should cook the root of winter cherry with ghee, blend it with cow’s milk, and dilute it with more milk. One should incant it twenty-five times and give it to such a woman to drink during her period, after bathing. The householder-husband, staying away from the wives of others and avoiding inappropriate sexual conduct, should then approach her sexually, or she him. She will then conceive a son. {9.9}</p>
<p>“If she experiences bleeding within the next three to five years when she is with child; if she does not conceive a child for many years; if she is harmed by the mantra magic, medicines, or mudrās of others; if she suffers a miscarriage; if she falls ill; if there is any other disorder caused by others; or if she is poisoned by animate or inanimate, or natural or artificial means—if any of this was effected by the friendly or hostile use of any root or medicine mantras, one should chant the mantra twenty-seven times and then grind old ghee with the moon-like eye of a peacock feather, making it homogenous. When it is finely ground, one should mix it with sugar and eat an amount the size of myrobalan fruit every day over seven days. {9.10}</p>
<p>“The patient should be made to drink milk cooked with sugar, having incanted it again and again. If one has a headache, one should wipe the head with a crow’s pinion incanted seven times. One will become well. {9.11}</p>
<p>“For female disease such as hypermenorrhea, one should grind the root of nīlikā together with milk, add to it some root of the indigo plant, and incant this one hundred and eight times. One should then blend it with milk and give it to the patient to drink. Similarly, in the case of a fever, be it a quartan, one-day, two-day, three-day, chronic, constant, or recurrent one, one should have the patient drink milk with ghee, incanted one hundred and eight times. The patient will become well. {9.12}</p>
<p>“Similarly, if someone is seized by a ḍākinī or a graha, one should incant one’s own face one hundred and eight times and face the affected person; they will become well. Similarly, if someone is seized by any terrible and evil nonhuman being, such as a mātṛkā, a pūtanā that attacks children, a vetāla, or a graha that seizes children, one should incant one’s own hand one hundred and eight times and touch the affected person on the head. They will become well. {9.13}</p>
<p>“A single repetition of the mantra will protect oneself; a double repetition, one’s friends; a triple one, one’s house; a fourfold one, one’s village; a fivefold one, everybody within the greater village area; up until, with one thousand repetitions, one may protect an army. One may perform these and all the other similar minor acts, even if one has not fully mastered the mantra. {9.14}</p>
<p>“One who desires accomplishment should not engage in trivial activities. One should go alone to a secluded place at the source of a river that flows into the ocean or on the ocean shore, on the bank of the Gaṅgā, or on the bank of any big river. There, in a clean spot, one should build a hut. One should perform the threefold ablutions, wear the three garments, observe silence, and live on food obtained by begging or on the practitioner’s diet of milk, barley, and fruit. Living thus, one should recite the mantra three million times. Then, once the sign has been observed, one should commence the sādhana practice. {9.15}</p>
<p>“On that location, in the same place, one should install the superior painting and offer a big pūjā with lamps of gold and silver, or of copper and clay, filled with olibanum oil or ghee, with wicks made of high-quality fabric. One should prepare one hundred thousand such lamps and offer all of them before the painting. {9.16}</p>
<p>“With the lighted lamps evenly arranged in contiguous rows, light will radiate from the painting. The moment the light shines, the painting will be haloed with a blazing ring of light that pervades everywhere. In the sky above drums will sound and congratulatory cheers will be heard. {9.17}</p>
<p>“At that point, a vidyādhara, in a form that delights sentient beings, will emerge from the corner where the practitioner is depicted on the previously painted cloth. One should give him a welcome offering, circumambulate him, bow to all the buddhas, and seize him. As soon as one has seized him, one will fly up together with all the beings holding lamps and, perhaps, ascend to 100,001 palaces. Surrounded by vidyādharīs playing divine instruments, singing songs in sweet voices, and dancing, one will be consecrated by them to kingship as a vidyādhara-cakravartin. Together with the holders of the lamps, one will revel in freedom from old age and death, endure for a great eon, have the luster of the rising sun and divinely beautiful limbs, and be adorned with a diverse array of garments.{9.18}</p>
<p>“The vidyādharas, for their part, will become one’s servants. Together with them, one will travel around as the king of all of them, and they will attend upon one as servants. One will become a monarch of vidyādharas. One will live long, be unassailable by all siddhas, be supremely attractive to vidyādhara girls, and will master all substances. One will worship the buddhas and bodhisattvas and will be placed on the pinnacle of their victory banners. One will be able to ascend even to the world of Brahmā in an instant. One will not even need to consider Śakra, let alone other vidyādharas.  In the end, one will attain the state of awakening. Noble Mañjuśrī will become one’s spiritual friend.{9.19}</p>
<p>“There are, however, those practitioners whose sādhana practice is more intense. In such a case, one should go alone to a secluded place free from the distractions of attachment. One should retreat to a big forest and find a place where there is a lotus pond adjacent to a lonely mountain and fed by a stream. One should climb to the top of the mountain and, having chosen either the single-syllable vidyārāja taught in the Mañjuśrī’s manual of rites, one taught by the Tathāgata or another bodhisattva, or any other one prefers, one should live on lotus roots and milk products, recite the vidyāmantra three million six hundred thousand times. At the end of the recitation, one should install, following the same procedure as previously taught, the superior one of the previously taught types of painting and prepare the lotus flowers smeared with white sandalwood and saffron paste. Having lit a fire of cutch tree sticks, one should offer into the fire the already-prepared lotuses thirty-six thousand times. {9.20}</p>
<p>“Then, at the conclusion of the homa rite, rays of light will issue forth from the painting of Lord Śākyamuni. Having illumined the practitioner, they will dissolve into his head. As soon as one is touched by these rays, one will attain the five superknowledges. Having attained the levels of a bodhisattva, one will go about as one pleases in the form of a god. One will live thirty-six eons and will traverse thirty-six buddhafields, beholding all their might. One will memorize the teachings of the thirty-six buddhas and will delight in worshiping and serving them. In the end, dedicated to the attainment of awakening, one will be wholly taken care of by the spiritual friend, Noble Mañjuśrī, right until the ultimate state of awakening, the final nirvāṇa.” {9.21}</p>
<p>This concludes the ninth chapter of “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter constitutes the detailed second chapter on the ritual involving the supreme sādhana method.</p>
<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>At that time Lord Śākyamuni taught yet another supreme ritual practice:</p>
<p>“Having chosen another mantra from this king of manuals, one should go down to [the bank of] the great river Gaṅgā. Staying in a boat in the middle of the river, one should incant rice gruel mixed with milk three million times on the days of one’s choice. Subsequently, at the end of recitation, one will perceive all the nāgas. One should then start the main practice. For that, one should prepare, in the middle of the boat, a fire pit in the shape of a lotus. One should prepare a big offering of ironwood blossoms to the painting. The painting of the superior type should be positioned facing west, with oneself sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass facing east. One should incant each of the ironwood blossoms seven times and offer it into the blazing fire of cutch tree sticks. One should do this until one has offered thirty thousand such blossoms, each smeared with white sandalwood and saffron paste. One should use nothing else. One should wait for the nāgas to appear. They will be enticed by the power substances, but will not take them. {10.1}</p>
<p>“Then, at the conclusion of the homa ritual, one will fly up together with the boat. One will become a vidyādhara-cakravartin, and all the nāga kings will become one’s followers, acting as servants. One will live thirty intermediate eons and will be able to act as one pleases. One’s activities will be unimpeded. One will be able to perceive Noble Mañjuśrī face to face. He will touch one on the head, and as soon as he has done so, one will obtain the five superknowledges. One will be certain to attain buddhahood. {10.2}</p>
<p>“There is another supreme ritual practice. One should descend to the bank of the great river Gaṅgā and construct a boat from a single block of wood from the bilva tree. It ought to be well made and attractive. One should board it, bringing an oar of bilva wood. With this, one should propel the boat, employing a genuinely skilled assistant. One should have him row the boat, without leaving the great river Gaṅgā, in circles, across, or lengthwise. One should choose either the six-syllable root mantra, the eight-syllable mantra, the single-syllable one, or another, such as those of the wrathful deities, dūtas, or dūtīs, or yet another mantra. One should then install the painting of the superior type facing west, with the practitioner facing east. From this point onward one can conduct the ritual as one wishes. One should use either a dish of milk, barley, and fruit, or one of water, radishes, and fruit. One should observe silence, ritually bathe three times a day, and possess three changes of clothing. One should practice pure conduct, with a very pure mind. First, one should recite the mantra, in front of the painting, six million times, following the previously described procedure. Then, at the end of the recitation, the boat will be fit to sail across a big ocean. {10.3}</p>
<p>“For that reason, the practitioner should collect the things that he will need and put them in the boat in advance. He should not be afraid when sailing across the great ocean. The boat will not be obstructed. It cannot be forced to turn back, except through the practitioner’s own will. He will thus be able to enter the big ocean in an instant even if this ocean is a thousand leagues away, so what need is there even to mention short distances? {10.4}</p>
<p>“Having entered it, this home of all rivers, one should start one’s practice. Having lit a fire of cutch tree sticks in a previously constructed pit or a clay basin made by a potter, one should offer into the fire six million oblations of stamens of ironwood blossoms mixed with white sandalwood and camphor. These individual oblations could be either small or big. {10.5}</p>
<p>“While one is offering the oblations, the rākṣasas who dwell in Laṅkā and assume many forms will cry, ‘Ha, ha!’ The nāga kings who dwell in Bhogavatī, a city of the nāgas, will emerge from the water in their different forms, ranging from exceedingly fierce to very peaceful. These nāgas and rākṣasas will say, ‘Get up, sir, get up! Become our master!’ In this way, the asuras, the yakṣas, the gods, the mahoragas, the celestial siddhas, and all the humans will try to entice the practitioner. One should neither get up, nor be afraid. {10.6}</p>
<p>“At that time, the adept of vidyās should, while reciting the mantra, threaten them with the index finger of the left hand. They will then disperse, running hither and thither, and be gone. Then, at the conclusion of the homa ritual, they will seize the boat together with the practitioner and, in an instant, take it to the realm of Akaniṣṭha. One can thus go to and return from other world spheres. One will become equal in mental power to a bodhisattva, possessing the five superknowledges, great magical abilities, and great power. One will be able to see Noble Mañjuśrī at all times. All the nāgas, rākṣasas, gods, asuras, and every other being will come under one’s control, having been appointed to carry out one’s orders by all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, noble śrāvakas, and those who have accomplished the mantra. They will be lovingly disposed toward the practitioner and act in his interest, so that he cannot be harmed by any being.{10.7}</p>
<p>“There is another supreme ritual practice. One should commission the construction of a boat from a big log of bilva wood, or perhaps from the pieces of a single block of wood. One should construct a big wharf on an island in the middle of the Gaṅgā.  One should build a boat docked at that place. In that boat, there should be one hundred and twenty passengers—each holding a flower and a lamp—who have performed the protection rite and are wearing white clothes. One should have them place the flowers and the lamps in front of the superior of the different types of painting, installed according to the previously described procedure. One should then perform a large pūjā in front of the painting and offer into the cutch-wood fire thirty-six thousand oblations of powdered ironwood blossoms mixed with saffron, white sandalwood, and camphor. {10.8}</p>
<p>“Subsequently, at the conclusion of the homa ritual, the boat will ascend to the world of Brahmā in an instant. When one arrives there, one will be able to move around at will. One will perceive Noble Mañjuśrī face to face. As soon as one beholds him, one will attain the bodhisattva levels and the five superknowledges. One will live for a long time, enduring for one great eon. One will become the great monarch of the vidyādharas, who, holding lamps in their hands, will become one’s helpers. Together with them one will be able to wander as one pleases; one will be able to go wherever one wants to. One will delight in worshiping the blessed buddhas. In the end, one will be certain to attain buddhahood. {10.9}</p>
<p>“There is yet another supreme ritual practice.</p>
<p>One will accomplish the supreme ritual</p>
<p>On a riverbank or an ocean shore,</p>
<p>Or also on the snowy mountain—</p>
<p>The king of the Vindhya range. {10.10}</p>
<p>“One will accomplish the supreme ritual</p>
<p>In the Sahya mountain range,</p>
<p>In Arbuda, or on Gandhamādana Mountain—</p>
<p>This three-peaked king of mountains— {10.11}</p>
<p>“Or similarly, by the great ocean,</p>
<p>Or on a mountain rich in trees and flowers.</p>
<p>It is in these places that the mantras</p>
<p>Taught by the victorious ones can be accomplished. {10.12}</p>
<p>“In a secluded place in the wilderness,</p>
<p>Free from the vulgar pursuits of lust,</p>
<p>Will the kings of mantras be accomplished—</p>
<p>In particular, in inaccessible mountain caves. {10.13}</p>
<p>“The kings of mantras will be accomplished</p>
<p>In pleasant places of retreat,</p>
<p>The ones particularly recommended by the victorious ones,</p>
<p>Free from wicked beings. {10.14}</p>
<p>“Places where the king is righteous</p>
<p>And people follow pure conduct,</p>
<p>Where mothers and fathers are revered,</p>
<p>And which are not without the twice born—</p>
<p>In such places and no others</p>
<p>Will the deities grant an accomplishment. {10.15}</p>
<p>“On the pleasant bank of the Bhāgīrāthī,</p>
<p>Or the bank of the Yamunā, so beautiful,</p>
<p>Or the Indus, the Narmadā, the Oxus,</p>
<p>Or the clean bank of the Candrabhāgā, {10.16}</p>
<p>“And also the rivers Kāverī, Sarasvatī,</p>
<p>Or the Sitā, this great river of the gods—</p>
<p>All these have been declared by the sons of those who possess the ten powers</p>
<p>To be places of accomplishment. {10.17}</p>
<p>“Among the places recommended by the those with the ten powers</p>
<p>Are the mountain ranges of the north,</p>
<p>Including in Kaśmīra, Tibet,</p>
<p>Nepāla, and Kāviśa, {10.18}</p>
<p>“And also all the places in China</p>
<p>That bring various accomplishments,</p>
<p>And the mountains and streams</p>
<p>That are located in northern countries. {10.19}</p>
<p>“Countries where people consume wheat and barley</p>
<p>Have been declared to be meritorious.</p>
<p>Where the inhabitants are compassionate,</p>
<p>The accomplishments will certainly be attained. {10.20}</p>
<p>“The great mountain, Śrīparvata,</p>
<p>Renowned in the Deccan,</p>
<p>And the temple in the glorious country of Dhānyakaṭaka,</p>
<p>Where the relics of the Victorious One are kept here on earth— {10.21}</p>
<p>“There the mantras can be swiftly accomplished</p>
<p>For the sake of all ritual purposes.</p>
<p>In the great temple of the Vajra Seat,</p>
<p>Where the splendid wheel of Dharma has been turned, {10.22}</p>
<p>“The supreme sage attained tranquility;</p>
<p>There, also, can the accomplishment be seen.</p>
<p>In the great temple where the Sage descended from the gods’ realm;</p>
<p>In the country of Saṃkaśya, the place of great miracles; {10.23}</p>
<p>“In the great city called Kapilavastu; in the best of the forests, Lumbini,</p>
<p>Where the most eminent of people [was born]—</p>
<p>There the kings of mantras bring accomplishment,</p>
<p>In the places praised by the Victorious One. {10.24}</p>
<p>“So, too, on Vulture Peak Mountain,</p>
<p>Or the place called Śītavana;</p>
<p>In the great, pleasant city called Kusuma,</p>
<p>And always in Vārāṇasī; {10.25}</p>
<p>“In Mathurā, Kanyakubja,</p>
<p>Or the city called Ujjain;</p>
<p>By the stūpa of Vaiśālī,</p>
<p>Or in the place called Mithilā— {10.26}</p>
<p>“Whatever cities and towns there are,</p>
<p>Or other places with human population,</p>
<p>If they are praised as places of merit,</p>
<p>Accomplishments will be attained in them. {10.27}</p>
<p>“Living in these and other places—</p>
<p>Villages, hamlets, and market towns,</p>
<p>Fine cities, the best of capitals,</p>
<p>Cities located on rivers, rich in merit— {10.28}</p>
<p>“And subsisting there on alms, one should joyfully engage</p>
<p>In mantra recitation and homa ritual,</p>
<p>Always occupying a place</p>
<p>With an open space or empty area. {10.29}</p>
<p>“One should do the preliminary practice</p>
<p>Before commencing any mantra rites.</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner, always in the center,</p>
<p>Should recite the mantra with great yearning.{10.30}</p>
<p>“Always engaged in recitation,</p>
<p>The mantra adept should practice renunciation,</p>
<p>Comport himself in a disciplined way, be truthful,</p>
<p>And delight in doing good for all beings. {10.31}</p>
<p>“First engendering faith in the mantra practice</p>
<p>And keeping one’s observances, one should recite</p>
<p>In a clean place at a good location,</p>
<p>Free from barbarians and thieves— {10.32}</p>
<p>“A place where there is no harm</p>
<p>From any creeping animals,</p>
<p>A place abounding in fruits and flowers,</p>
<p>Praiseworthy, and supplied with pure water. {10.33}</p>
<p>“A mantra adept is praised [if he recites]</p>
<p>All the mantras in no other places than these.</p>
<p>The recommended sites are a temple,</p>
<p>A cemetery, or a lonely mountain. {10.34}</p>
<p>“A mantra adept also recites all mantras</p>
<p>By a solitary lingam, or in a wilderness.</p>
<p>One should perform the protection ritual</p>
<p>For oneself and one’s friends, and do the preparatory rites. {10.35}</p>
<p>“The reciter, always engaged in recitation,</p>
<p>Should always practice the supreme mantra</p>
<p>In a great forest with big trees,</p>
<p>Rich in blossoms and bearing fruits. {10.36}</p>
<p>“ . . .</p>
<p>On a mountaintop, in a valley,</p>
<p>Or in a nice place with clean water,</p>
<p>Such as the bank of a big river. {10.37}</p>
<p>“The mantra adept should practice the mantra</p>
<p>In places . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>In the eastern country by the Brahmaputra,</p>
<p>The great and beautiful river. {10.38}</p>
<p>“Also in the country of Kāmarūpa,</p>
<p>With its thriving and splendid cities,</p>
<p>Or where the best of rivers flows,</p>
<p>Full of merits, winding on the valley floor— {10.39}</p>
<p>“In such a place should the reciter</p>
<p>Do his devotion, remaining pure.</p>
<p>He should do the preliminary practice</p>
<p>Intended for all the rites. {10.40}</p>
<p>“And definitely at the mouth of the Gaṅgā,</p>
<p>Where the river empties into the ocean,</p>
<p>Should he also recite his mantra, remaining pure</p>
<p>And keeping the observances enjoined for whatever methods. {10.41}</p>
<p>“The great cemeteries, too,</p>
<p>Are where the reciter should always recite,</p>
<p>Or rivers with pure waters,</p>
<p>Free of worm-like creatures. {10.42}</p>
<p>“So, the reciter should always recite the mantra</p>
<p>In those places with a focused mind,</p>
<p>Because no merit shall be seen</p>
<p>By one engaged in the affairs of the world. {10.43}</p>
<p>“However, for the sake of mantra instructions,</p>
<p>One may remain in the world for some time;</p>
<p>Otherwise, one should go elsewhere,</p>
<p>Departing at the time of a lunar eclipse.{10.44}</p>
<p>“Having obtained the samaya, one may remain</p>
<p>In the world for a short time, not otherwise.</p>
<p>Later the adept of mantras should, without delay,</p>
<p>Go elsewhere, wherever he is able to. {10.45}</p>
<p>“He should always dwell in places where there are</p>
<p>The dazzling white reliquaries of the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>And also all the holy sites in this world</p>
<p>Where wrong doctrines are absent—{10.46}</p>
<p>“The mantra adept should always avoid</p>
<p>Other holy sites.</p>
<p>An expert in mantras should not dwell in them,</p>
<p>As they constitute the cause of bad rebirth. {10.47}</p>
<p>“Instead, he should dwell in those places on earth</p>
<p>That have been visited by the best of victors,</p>
<p>The rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas, the great bodhisattva beings,</p>
<p>The śrāvakas, or the sons of the victorious ones. {10.48}</p>
<p>“The mantra adept, reciting his mantra,</p>
<p>Should frequent all these places.</p>
<p>In such places he should always practice</p>
<p>With great effort as previously explained. {10.49}</p>
<p>“Knowing the right procedure, the mantra adept</p>
<p>Should recite the mantra ever more,</p>
<p>For through the recitation and the homa ritual</p>
<p>He will remove all the evil of embodied beings.</p>
<p>He should therefore recite the mantra</p>
<p>With all his diligence and a focused mind. {10.50}</p>
<p>“If one does not find, among those places that were taught for all rites, places for the practice of the rites that bring supreme accomplishment, one should perform the preliminary practices in any clean place anywhere. With faith and resolve, one should commence the supreme rites employing the sādhana method.{10.51}</p>
<p>“To start, one should install the painting of the superior type facing west, with oneself facing east. One should take some clay, either from a fine anthill or from the bank of the Gaṅgā, and, optionally, [the root of] khaskhas grass, white sandalwood, and saffron. One should mix this very well with camphor and fashion from this an effigy of a peacock. One should place it in front of the painting and fashion with kuśa grass that has grown in a clean place, with the tips of the grass blades untrimmed, the shape of a ring. Holding this ring with one’s right hand in front of the painting, and the peacock with one’s left, one should, on the night of the full moon, offer to the painting a large pūjā, burning an incense of camphor. One should recite the mantra until daybreak. {10.52}</p>
<p>“Then, at sunrise, this clay peacock will become the great king of peacocks, and the ring of grass will blaze with light. Oneself will become possessed of a divine body, adorned with divine garlands, clothes, and ornaments. One will be graced with a desirable form that resembles the rising sun. One should bow to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, circumambulate the painting clockwise, take the painting into one’s hands,  and sit upon the peacock as one’s mount. In an instant one will ascend to the realm of Brahmā. One will become the great emperor of vidyādharas, surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of millions of them. One will live for sixty eons of Manu. One will be able to go wherever one wants, and one’s movement will not be impeded. One will be endowed with divine good fortune and be able to see Noble Mañjuśrī face to face. Mañjuśrī will become one’s spiritual friend and, in the end, one will attain buddhahood. {10.53}</p>
<p>“Similarly, one should procure a mendicant’s staff, a water pitcher, a sacred cord, red arsenic and bovine orpiment, a sword, an arrow, a javelin, an axe, and [other] different kinds of weapons and also, made of clay, humans and animals, different types of birds for riding, lions, tigers, hyenas, and so forth, fashioning them from clay from an anthill or clay from a riverbank richly scented with pleasant scents. Likewise, one should procure conveyances provided with a chair or a bed, white parasols, various types of head ornaments, all types of jewels, and all the different requisites of one who has gone forth, including a rosary of rudrākṣa beads, sandals, wooden clogs, an alms bowl, an ascetic’s robes and staff, a needle, and a knife and any other implements made of ‘flower-metal,’ starting with a bowl. One should fashion them from flower-metal, clay from an anthill, or clay from the riverbank, and smear or sprinkle all of them with the five products of a cow. One should incant them one hundred and eight times with the purificatory mantra, one-syllable mantra, or any other mantra taught in this king of manuals, with the exception of the mantras employed in subsidiary practices. Having performed, as appropriate, the desired protection ritual for oneself and one’s friends, one who is well acquainted with the knowledge of the mantra system  should secretly install, in any of the previously described places, the painting of the superior type facing west, with oneself facing east, and offer to it a large pūjā. Burning incense of camphor, one should grasp any one of the previously mentioned individual weapons and implements, fashioned as specified, and recite over it the mantra on a bright night of the full moon until sunrise. {10.54}</p>
<p>“Immediately, the painting will appear enveloped in a great halo of light. If it was a mode of conveyance that was grasped by the practitioner, he will be able, after boarding it, to go wherever he pleases. If, on the other hand, it was an ornament or a weapon item, he will become, when holding it, a venerable vidyādhara-cakravartin. He will be able to go wherever he pleases, possessed of divine form, effulgent as the rising sun, enveloped in a halo of great light, with the body as bright as lightning. He will be the master of all vidyādharas, will live for one great eon, have a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyādharas, and live in a divine palace made of precious jewels and gems.{10.55}</p>
<p>[The ability] that was perceived in the previously crafted conveyance, whatever [that being] was good at, will now become its great power. This being will become one’s conveyance for riding and a companion. Thwarting the minute powers of others’ mantras and employing the powers of one’s own, it will become compassionate at heart, desiring to benefit others, and always devoted [to the practitioner]. And whatever items of weaponry, ornaments, jewels, and so forth one took up, starting with the beings who serve as seat and bed conveyances, they will always follow the practitioner to give him good protection, cover, and shelter. {10.56}</p>
<p>“One will obtain great power, energy, and a superb physical body. One will behold Noble Mañjuśrī face to face and be applauded  by him. When touched by him on the head, one will receive the boon of spiritual friendship until one has reached the essence of awakening. One will definitely obtain the ten powers. One will be venerated by all beings and will never be assailed or defeated by spirits. One will not be separated from the lineage of the final goal and will attain the bodhisattva levels. One will follow the obligations of a bodhisattva consistent with the ten powers. In short, all the supreme rites should be performed in these supreme places, and one who delights in the supreme worship in front of the superior painting should only perform the supreme rites.{10.57}</p>
<p>“One should become a sky-traveling vidyādhara—a bodhisattva endowed with the five superknowledges, established on the bodhisattva levels, and able to traverse the world spheres in this very body—in order to swell the lineage of the buddhas possessed of the ten powers, to be able to see Noble Mañjuśrī face to face, to give Dharma discourses that will bear fruit, to encourage others to listen to Dharma teachings, to prevent the lineage of the buddhas from dying out, to gradually attain omniscience, to reach the tenth bodhisattva level called The Cloud of Dharma, to dry up and pacify the afflictions with the rain of ambrosia, to continually confer benefits on the people of the world, to guard the Dharma eye of the Tathāgata, to make the doctrine of the Tathāgata bear fruit, to manifest the power of the sādhana methods that involve the mantra practice, and to propagate the teaching of the greatness of all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and noble śrāvakas. For all this, one needs to accomplish the complete teachings in this king of manuals. {10.58}</p>
<p>“This ritual of the king of paintings should be accomplished following the procedure taught in all the tantras and manuals of worldly and supramundane mantras that are to be recited by the practitioner in front of the superior type of painting.  Briefly speaking, it can be accomplished through the rites taught in this and also other manuals. These mantras will quickly bring on the accomplishment. Whatever I have taught here will definitely bring accomplishment.” {10.59}</p>
<p>This concludes the tenth chapter of “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter constitutes the detailed chapter on the procedure involving the superior painting.</p>
<p>Chapter 11</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni looked again at the realm of the Pure Abode, and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, in your ritual, a painting procedure of the medium type, a practice procedure serving as the means for accomplishing middling rites. I will teach it in brief, so please listen carefully and reflect upon it well. I will teach it now.” {11.1}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, for his part, said this to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“May the Blessed One, the teacher, full of compassion for the world and delighting in benefiting all beings, speak! Please speak, if you think that the time is right, out of compassion for us and regard for future generations.” {11.2}</p>
<p>Having been thus addressed by Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the Blessed One said this:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī. All the rites involved in the practice of the mantra conduct will bear fruit and not be futile for those who, first of all, are firmly established in discipline, ritual observances, purificatory acts, ritual obligations, mantra recitations, homa ritual, and the meditation methods. Then, the application of all the mantras will swiftly lead to success. Why is this so? I will explain that. Listen, O divine youth! {11.3}</p>
<p>“To start, one should assume the disciplined conduct and observances pertaining to the practice of vidyās. First, one should take the samaya pledge according to the instructions of the maṇḍala master as clearly taught in your king of manuals. One should acquire a learned master who has received the ‘master empowerment’ (ācāryābhiṣeka) and has the acumen of a spiritual instructor. Such a master should possess the Dharma that is virtuous and clear and be truthful, diligent, grateful, steadfast, good natured, not too old and not too young, free from desire with regard to all gain and favors, and celibate. He should be compassionate, but not merely on account of desire or based on sensual pleasure or emotional attachment. He should not speak untruth out of strong delusion and greed, let alone due to trivial reasons. He should keep his promises and be equanimous toward all beings, have compassion for them, and practice generosity. He should have completed the preparatory rites and the preliminary practice that involves the recitation of your secret mantra and have gained [therefrom the requisite] knowledge. He should have entered your maṇḍala according to the right order of succession. He must understand the ways of the world and also know the ritual procedure. He should be kind, industrious, and wise. He must practice goodness and be fearless, free from hesitation or vacillation, stable, and diligent. He should not be afflicted by any disease that would render him inactive, and he should be disciplined. He should come from a great and illustrious family. These are the qualities that the maṇḍala master should be endowed with. {11.4}</p>
<p>“The practitioner, for his part, should be either the same as him or lacking in some attributes. After worshiping such a maṇḍala master, he should supplicate him as follows:</p>
<p>“ ‘I would like to enter the samaya with you, master, who are identical with the great bodhisattva, the divine youth Mañjuśrī. Out of the master’s kindness, please instruct me with a benevolent and kind mind.’ {11.5}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master then,  following the same procedure as previously explained, should examine the disciples as before and usher them in. He should give the empowerment as before and give them the mantra. He should then explain the stages of samaya and the secret tantra, mudrā, and rites. After examining them for a long time and determining their character, he teaches them the rites for all tantras, mantras, and so forth. He should not teach this to anyone else. This is the accepted procedure. {11.6}</p>
<p>“The disciple, for his part, should gratify the maṇḍala master with anything that may be pleasing to him, and offer himself and the enjoyments. {11.7}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala master should then regard the disciple as his son, and treat him as such. Like a mother, he should offer him comforts and enjoyments. {11.8}</p>
<p>“The disciple then, having obtained a particular mantra, should retire to a secluded area, to a place as previously described in more detail, and, in short, employ this mantra for the summoning, dismissing, and offering to the deities a bali consisting of lamps, perfume, and incense, following the elaborate procedure that has been taught as part of the maṇḍala instructions. He should thus summon the deity and present it with a welcome offering and a seat at the three junctions of the day. He should perform ritual ablutions three times a day, wear the three-piece apparel of an ascetic, and recite the mantra every day. Regarding the junctions of the day, the first junction is said to be from the end of the night until the sun is four angular cubits above the horizon. The second junction is said to be at midday, for as long as the center of the sun disk traverses in the sky the distance of four cubits. The third junction is said to be at sunset, for as long as it takes the sun to move the full distance of four cubits. {11.9}</p>
<p>“One should approach a master who is learned and skilled</p>
<p>And has taken up the vow of disciplined [conduct],</p>
<p>One born in a great and illustrious family,</p>
<p>Steadfast and diligent in every respect. {11.10}</p>
<p>“He must be actively engaged in the art of mantras</p>
<p>And be skilled and judicious in all tasks.</p>
<p>He should be subtle, have expert knowledge of mantras,</p>
<p>And always uphold the domain of Dharma. {11.11}</p>
<p>“He should have great perseverance and ardor</p>
<p>And be unconcerned about worldly affairs.</p>
<p>He must have faith in the teachings of the Sage</p>
<p>And shun the teachings of worldly masters.{11.12}</p>
<p>“He must have performed the required mantra recitations,</p>
<p>Have discernment, and have done the preliminary practice.</p>
<p>He should understand the mantra of Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>And have complete confidence in it. {11.13}</p>
<p>“He should also know the worldly magical rites</p>
<p>That employ mantras taught by the Buddha.</p>
<p>He should have performed the protection ritual,</p>
<p>Have unwavering strength, and always delight in pure conduct. {11.14}</p>
<p>“He must follow, in all respects,</p>
<p>The path shown by the Buddha.</p>
<p>He should be engaged in the recitation of the mantra taught here,</p>
<p>Described by the Victorious One as perfect. {11.15}</p>
<p>“Seeing that the fruits of one’s actions</p>
<p>Come without fail, even in the afterlife,</p>
<p>He would be wary of any evil,</p>
<p>Even as small as a tiny particle.</p>
<p>He should be pure, adroit, not lazy,</p>
<p>Intelligent, and pleasant to behold. {11.16}</p>
<p>“Whatever mantras have been taught by those with the ten powers</p>
<p>And by the sons of the same, the victorious ones,</p>
<p>And whatever worldly mantras there are,</p>
<p>And also those in the Vajra and Lotus families,</p>
<p>He should always exert himself in their study,</p>
<p>Absorbing the meaning from the written treatises. {11.17}</p>
<p>“He should not be diseased or disabled,</p>
<p>Neither too old nor too young.</p>
<p>He should have accomplished the mantra and be protected by it.</p>
<p>He should operate efficiently in every respect. {11.18}</p>
<p>“He must not procrastinate, be free of haughtiness,</p>
<p>And specifically understand bodily expressions.</p>
<p>Celibate and with great insight,</p>
<p>He should be solitary and not mingle. {11.19}</p>
<p>“He, the hero, must have obtained an initiation</p>
<p>Into this tantra, taught by Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>He should have reached the end of his recitations</p>
<p>And have gained the understanding. {11.20}</p>
<p>“He should have great dignity, understand the ways of the world,</p>
<p>And reflect upon the reality of the different states of rebirth.</p>
<p>He should apply himself diligently to the practice of virtue,</p>
<p>Be generous, and delight in benefiting beings. {11.21}</p>
<p>“A master distinguished in this way</p>
<p>Should always be supplicated,</p>
<p>As the maṇḍala containing mantras written by him</p>
<p>Will lead to accomplishment. {11.22}</p>
<p>“An empowerment bestowed by him</p>
<p>Will bear great fruits.</p>
<p>Such a master should always be venerated as a sage</p>
<p>By the disciples who desire accomplishment. {11.23}</p>
<p>“His instructions must not be disobeyed</p>
<p>But should be followed by the disciples with diligence.</p>
<p>He should be given objects of enjoyment,</p>
<p>Whatever are available, according to one’s means— {11.24}</p>
<p>“A gift big or small,</p>
<p>Or any gift that will please the master.</p>
<p>Just as the father’s body and mind</p>
<p>Constitute the cause for the existence of one’s own body,{11.25}</p>
<p>“In the same way will the disciple who knows the Dharma</p>
<p>Obtain renown, accomplishments,</p>
<p>Long life, and good health,</p>
<p>If only he offers his wealth to the master. {11.26}</p>
<p>“A disciple who reveres his master</p>
<p>Will make excellent progress.</p>
<p>His mantras will bring accomplishments</p>
<p>Once the path of ritual procedures has been explained. {11.27}</p>
<p>“All the buddhas rejoice,</p>
<p>And so do the foremost sons of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>When the teachers are served, adored,</p>
<p>And worshiped respectfully.{11.28}</p>
<p>“All the gods are pleased</p>
<p>With any kind act done to a teacher.</p>
<p>All this pertains to teachers</p>
<p>Who impart the knowledge of mantras. {11.29}</p>
<p>“If he has not done this already,</p>
<p>The practitioner should first enter into the samaya bond,</p>
<p>Regardless of whether he is a person of equal</p>
<p>Or superior position to the teacher. {11.30}</p>
<p>“Neither an ignorant nor a brilliant disciple</p>
<p>Should ever disrespect the master.</p>
<p>He should instead apply himself to the tantra</p>
<p>In which he has been instructed.</p>
<p>He should engage, for the sake of accomplishment,</p>
<p>In the practice of the mantra that he was instructed in. {11.31}</p>
<p>“A previously trained disciple</p>
<p>Should harbor no jealousy toward the master,</p>
<p>But instead should have an eye</p>
<p>That is the embodiment of growing love. {11.32}</p>
<p>“The master is himself the cause</p>
<p>For the development of the disciple;</p>
<p>A bond of love should stretch</p>
<p>Between their two minds. {11.33}</p>
<p>“While maintaining a loving mind</p>
<p>He should offer the mantra to the disciple;</p>
<p>Whenever the disciple sees the master,</p>
<p>Or the master sees the disciple, {11.34}</p>
<p>“They should always be joyful,</p>
<p>Remain practicing together,</p>
<p>And at all times focused</p>
<p>On the path of mantric conduct. {11.35}</p>
<p>“Both of them, the father and the son,</p>
<p>Knowing the mantra, will reap the results.</p>
<p>Both the disciple and the teacher</p>
<p>Will find stability and joy. {11.36}</p>
<p>“The son—the dear Dharma child—</p>
<p>Should always be diligently protected.</p>
<p>The uninterrupted condition of the buddhas</p>
<p>Is present also in them.{11.37}</p>
<p>“If the buddhas are absent and beings are without a protector,</p>
<p>The mantras should be given to them just as they are taught.</p>
<p>They should be given in particular to those beings</p>
<p>Who are destitute or powerless.</p>
<p>Mantra practice is excellent</p>
<p>For all beings without exception. {11.38}</p>
<p>“This mantra practice can be done at all times</p>
<p>By those of the lowest, highest, and medium capacities,</p>
<p>And can be used to bring benefit</p>
<p>To all beings on any occasion.{11.39}</p>
<p>“This mantra conduct should be given to those who seek it</p>
<p>After determining their state and origin.</p>
<p>The disciple, for his part,</p>
<p>Should train in whatever mantra he desires.{11.40}</p>
<p>“One who desires accomplishment should follow</p>
<p>The path taught [here], and no other.</p>
<p>One should travel on this path,</p>
<p>Superior to other paths. {11.41}</p>
<p>“One should bow to the master with one’s head</p>
<p>As if to one’s father, and then depart, wherever one pleases.</p>
<p>One should go to a secluded place</p>
<p>And recite the mantra, fully focused. {11.42}</p>
<p>“Sustained by food obtained through alms,</p>
<p>Observing silence except for the three recitation sessions a day,</p>
<p>One should follow the path,</p>
<p>Just as it was previously taught. {11.43}</p>
<p>“Then, following this conduct,</p>
<p>One should frequent various places of abode,</p>
<p>Such as great forests, mountaintops,</p>
<p>And also clean riverbanks, {11.44}</p>
<p>“Secluded cow pens and forts</p>
<p>That are devoid of people,</p>
<p>Empty temples, trees,</p>
<p>Solitary lingams, mountain peaks, {11.45}</p>
<p>“Pleasant shores of the great ocean,</p>
<p>Sandy islands,</p>
<p>Or various other places as previously described,</p>
<p>Pleasing to the mind. {11.46}</p>
<p>“One should recite the mantra in these and other places</p>
<p>With a well-focused mind,</p>
<p>In the company of friends endowed with auspicious marks</p>
<p>And trained in philosophy and conduct for the sake of mantra practice. {11.47}</p>
<p>“They ought to know the nature of gestures</p>
<p>And be the same as or similar to</p>
<p>Brave men victorious in battles,</p>
<p>Who are honest and patient, {11.48}</p>
<p>“Who have faith in the mantra practice</p>
<p>And the related doctrine taught by the Victorious One,</p>
<p>Who are endowed with the excellent auspicious marks,</p>
<p>And who are patient and forbearing. {11.49}</p>
<p>“A practitioner who has such companions</p>
<p>Will accomplish all activities without toil.</p>
<p>He should rise from his bed early</p>
<p>And wash himself in clean water, {11.50}</p>
<p>“The water from a stream or a big pond</p>
<p>That is free of living organisms.</p>
<p>Such a mantra adept should rub his body</p>
<p>With powdered clay or cow dung {11.51}</p>
<p>“And then, having purified with the mantra</p>
<p>Some clean water free of any dirt,</p>
<p>Should perform ritual ablutions while reciting the mantra.</p>
<p>He should not miss the right time for these acts. {11.52}</p>
<p>“Accordingly, after rising up [in the morning],</p>
<p>He should stand on the bank and cleanse his hands with clay—</p>
<p>Seven, seven, and again seven times—</p>
<p>Twenty-one times in all. {11.53}</p>
<p>“He should then sit down there,</p>
<p>And clean his teeth with a tooth stick.</p>
<p>Having spat out the washed-off matter,</p>
<p>He should praise the Protector. {11.54}</p>
<p>“Having praised the protector of the world,</p>
<p>He should make offerings pleasing to the mind,</p>
<p>Praising him, again and again,</p>
<p>With complimentary hymns of praise. {11.55}</p>
<p>“Also, while reciting, he should offer to the Teacher</p>
<p>A welcome offering of fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>Bow with his head to the buddhas</p>
<p>And then to their disciples. {11.56}</p>
<p>“He should confess his wrongdoings</p>
<p>In front of these protectors of the world,</p>
<p>And place food and refreshments</p>
<p>In front of the painting of middling type. {11.57}</p>
<p>“He should prepare a seat of kuśa grass</p>
<p>And sit there with a focused mind.</p>
<p>He should recite the mantra with keenness,</p>
<p>Using a rosary of rudrākṣa beads.{11.58}</p>
<p>“He should only recite the mantra that he was given,</p>
<p>And not any other mantra,</p>
<p>In a voice neither too low,</p>
<p>Nor, indeed, too loud. {11.59}</p>
<p>“In the rites of the medium type,</p>
<p>The vow holder should always recite the mantra the ‘medium’ way.</p>
<p>He should resolutely avoid speaking loudly,</p>
<p>Nor should the words be too low. {11.60}</p>
<p>“In the rites of the medium type, the ‘medium’ speech</p>
<p>Was described by the Victorious One as the best,</p>
<p>So one should recite not too loudly</p>
<p>And not too low, but always in between;</p>
<p>All the buddhas of the past</p>
<p>Employed their voice in the best possible way.{11.61}</p>
<p>“One should not recite the mantra near to other people,</p>
<p>Or within their range of hearing,</p>
<p>But in a hidden place known only to oneself,</p>
<p>Reciting in a voice of medium volume. {11.62}</p>
<p>“If one engages in recitation in this way,</p>
<p>The meaning of any mantra will be clearly heard.</p>
<p>One should keep reciting this mantra</p>
<p>If one desires accomplishment of the medium type. {11.63}</p>
<p>“Consequently, the reciter should chant the mantra</p>
<p>In a secluded place where no one gathers,</p>
<p>A place devoid of people,</p>
<p>But where the essential meaning of the mantra can be clearly heard.{11.64}</p>
<p>“He should recite during the second half</p>
<p>Of the second half of the fourth division of the night,</p>
<p>When the copper-red disk of the sun</p>
<p>Is four angular cubits above the horizon, {11.65}</p>
<p>“For that is how the buddhas, the best of men,</p>
<p>Have designated the ‘first junction.’</p>
<p>The ‘yoke length’ is the length of four cubits,</p>
<p>Proclaimed as the ‘medium’ [length]. {11.66}</p>
<p>“One should stop the recitation</p>
<p>After the sun has risen up into the sky.</p>
<p>Having stopped reciting the mantra and dismissed [the deity],</p>
<p>The vow holder should make an offering to send [it] away. {11.67}</p>
<p>“For the rest of the time henceforth,</p>
<p>One should devote oneself to this expert instruction of the Sage:</p>
<p>One should venerate the teachings, and so forth, of genuine Dharma,</p>
<p>As found in the Prajñāpāramitā and other literature.{11.68}</p>
<p>“Also the books, such as the one called Daśabhūmika,</p>
<p>Should always be venerated and read aloud.</p>
<p>When the prescribed time has arrived,</p>
<p>One should bow to the buddhas, the best of men, {11.69}</p>
<p>“And to one’s mantra, the lord of mantras,</p>
<p>And then depart for the sake of sustenance.</p>
<p>Observing thus the prescribed regimen,</p>
<p>Eating at the appointed time, and controlling one’s senses, {11.70}</p>
<p>“A Dharma practitioner should always exert himself</p>
<p>In the pure training as taught by the Buddha.</p>
<p>Observing silence, one should go to another village,</p>
<p>Always delighting in pure conduct. {11.71}</p>
<p>“The mantra reciter should seek alms</p>
<p>Only in houses where Dharma is followed,</p>
<p>Where the water is filtered and free of living organisms</p>
<p>And the food is known to be pure.{11.72}</p>
<p>“A house where the housewife has correct views</p>
<p>And where there is faith in the Buddha’s teachings—</p>
<p>It is in such a household that a mendicant</p>
<p>Should always seek and receive alms. {11.73}</p>
<p>“Just like a well-equipped warrior</p>
<p>Would enter the heat of a battle</p>
<p>And destroy his opponents without fail,</p>
<p>Without himself being harmed by the enemy, {11.74}</p>
<p>“So should a mantra practitioner,</p>
<p>Who lives on alms, always enter a village.</p>
<p>When seeing pleasing forms,</p>
<p>Or hearing pleasant sounds, {11.75}</p>
<p>“One should, in order to appease the passions,</p>
<p>Contemplate that which is pleasant as unpleasant.</p>
<p>Seeing a female body</p>
<p>Adorned with the gracefulness of youth, {11.76}</p>
<p>“One should contemplate it being impure and smelly,</p>
<p>Disgusting with its pus, urine, and so forth,</p>
<p>Deposited in a cemetery and slimed over by worms—</p>
<p>A body that is impermanent and a source of suffering. {11.77}</p>
<p>“The childish, ignorant of mantra,</p>
<p>Cycle through the five destinies;</p>
<p>Strung upon the thread of karma,</p>
<p>They wallow in misery for a long time. {11.78}</p>
<p>“Such fools, steeped in ignorance</p>
<p>And blind from birth, create for themselves causes of suffering.</p>
<p>Beings with warped minds sink in dejection</p>
<p>Because of things they are attached to. {11.79}</p>
<p>“Dressed in the costumes of different types of karma,</p>
<p>Excited in many different ways,</p>
<p>For a long time they are mounted upon swings</p>
<p>And pushed back and forth. {11.80}</p>
<p>“Engaged in their dance,</p>
<p>They are impelled to follow its steps.</p>
<p>Addicted to what is impure,</p>
<p>Beings remain despondent for long periods of time. {11.81}</p>
<p>“Being born in the waters of the ocean of existence,</p>
<p>There is no end to their births,</p>
<p>Which are awash with the water of suffering,</p>
<p>Like a well bucket is awash with the water from the well. {11.82}</p>
<p>“For women have been declared by the buddhas</p>
<p>To be nothing but the root of suffering.</p>
<p>So also said the śrāvakas, the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>The pratyeka­buddhas, and the sages. {11.83}</p>
<p>“Their minds led astray by women,</p>
<p>Beings drown in the ocean of cyclic existence</p>
<p>That cannot be disturbed</p>
<p>And is impossible to dry up. {11.84}</p>
<p>“They then wander through the six realms:</p>
<p>The hells and animal realms,</p>
<p>The realms of hungry ghosts and of the asuras,</p>
<p>And the realms of gods and of men. {11.85}</p>
<p>“Men wander throughout all these destinies,</p>
<p>Powerless and deluded on account of women,</p>
<p>Sinking in the great mire—</p>
<p>This prison of the ocean of saṃsāra. {11.86}</p>
<p>“Men fooled by craving for women</p>
<p>Are like jackals fooled by rotten flesh.</p>
<p>Beings suffer acute pain</p>
<p>Because of things they are addicted to. {11.87}</p>
<p>“If they take up the Buddha’s teaching,</p>
<p>Even those who previously corrupted the virtuous Dharma</p>
<p>Will stop all suffering</p>
<p>And be no more in the ocean of saṃsāra.{11.88}</p>
<p>“Those who are keen on and enjoy mantra recitation</p>
<p>Know great renown, are free of craving,</p>
<p>Are majestic, are a friend to the downtrodden,</p>
<p>And are free from all suffering. {11.89}</p>
<p>“Self-controlled and knowing the great truth,</p>
<p>They worship the master and the deities.</p>
<p>They are devoted to their mother and father</p>
<p>And do not suffer on the account of women.{11.90}</p>
<p>“Those who apply the teachings on the absolute truth</p>
<p>Perceive that which is impermanent to be empty and fraught with suffering.</p>
<p>Such mantra reciters regard the female body</p>
<p>The same as goiter.{11.91}</p>
<p>“Naive sensualists, though, who are of little intelligence,</p>
<p>Are unable to escape saṃsāra.</p>
<p>One who is consistently attached to women</p>
<p>Will not gain accomplishment. {11.92}</p>
<p>“Such a person’s conduct will be undistinguished;</p>
<p>It will not even be mediocre.</p>
<p>A reciter without discipline</p>
<p>Will not gain even the smallest accomplishment.{11.93}</p>
<p>“The lord of sages did not prescribe mantra practice</p>
<p>For the ill disciplined,</p>
<p>As it would not lead to the city,</p>
<p>Land, or even the direction of nirvāṇa. {11.94}</p>
<p>“For a debased fool such as this,</p>
<p>How could his mantra succeed?</p>
<p>For a person fickle in his discipline,</p>
<p>What pleasant state could be found? {11.95}</p>
<p>“Heaven is not for him,</p>
<p>Nor a happy departure from this world,</p>
<p>Let alone an accomplishment</p>
<p>Of mantras taught by the Victorious One. {11.96}</p>
<p>“When the crown of a palmyra tree</p>
<p>Has been cut off,</p>
<p>How will fresh green shoots arise</p>
<p>When the tree has no greenery? {11.97}</p>
<p>“So have been described the prospects of</p>
<p>Accomplishing the mantra for those who are foolish in this life—</p>
<p>The ill-disciplined evildoers</p>
<p>Who develop attachment to women again and again.</p>
<p>How could the king of mantras bring success</p>
<p>When one is associating with a nonvirtuous teacher? {11.98}</p>
<p>“A mantra reciter should therefore always be self-controlled</p>
<p>And never stray into vice.</p>
<p>Those who avoid contact with women</p>
<p>Will gain accomplishment. {11.99}</p>
<p>“No accomplishment is described for the others—</p>
<p>The childish ones smitten by women.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the wise ones who dislike schisms,</p>
<p>Who are pure and associate with skillful friends,{11.100}</p>
<p>“The steadfast heroes of the noble family,</p>
<p>Who are kind hearted and pleasant to behold,</p>
<p>Who understand the distinction between right and wrong,</p>
<p>Will gain accomplishment without difficulty. {11.101}</p>
<p>“A mantra adept, conducting himself as described,</p>
<p>Should enter a village in order to seek alms.</p>
<p>He should go to a place as previously described</p>
<p>That is pleasing to him. {11.102}</p>
<p>“Having gone there,</p>
<p>He should eat proper . . .</p>
<p>Once he has settled in a clean place,</p>
<p>Living on alms and keeping his thoughts pure,{11.103}</p>
<p>“He should wipe his feet</p>
<p>And go out of his dwelling once again.</p>
<p>Using water free of living organisms,</p>
<p>He should place his right hand on his right calf {11.104}</p>
<p>“And his left hand on his left calf,</p>
<p>And rub them.</p>
<p>To prepare his right hand,</p>
<p>He should cleanse it by wiping it{11.105}</p>
<p>“Seven times with pure and clean clay</p>
<p>That has been prepared before.</p>
<p>Then he should place,</p>
<p>In a clean and stainless pot,{11.106}</p>
<p>“Some fresh cow dung excreted from a brown cow</p>
<p>And purified by the mantra.</p>
<p>He should add to it water that is free of living organisms</p>
<p>And draw with this mixture the maṇḍala of the Teacher.{11.107}</p>
<p>“Thus, one should first draw the maṇḍala of the best of sages,</p>
<p>Which should be, preferably, one cubit in diameter;</p>
<p>Then second, the maṇḍala of the lord of one’s own mantra;</p>
<p>And third, of one’s family deity. {11.108}</p>
<p>“The mantra practitioner should always draw the maṇḍala</p>
<p>Of that deity whose mantra he is reciting.</p>
<p>The fourth maṇḍala is said to be</p>
<p>For the enjoyment of all sentient beings.{11.109}</p>
<p>“On the right, one should always draw</p>
<p>The maṇḍala of the lord of the world,</p>
<p>Which is for all the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>And should be square in shape. {11.110}</p>
<p>“Second is the maṇḍala for pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>And the third for the sons of those endowed with the ten powers.</p>
<p>These seven maṇḍalas</p>
<p>Should all have four corners. {11.111}</p>
<p>“One should draw them either one cubit,</p>
<p>Or half a cubit in diameter, every single day,</p>
<p>In a secret place. Then, reciting every day,</p>
<p>One will be able to purify one’s sins. {11.112}</p>
<p>“When rising after the ritual,</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner should wash his hands carefully.</p>
<p>He should perform ritual ablutions in clean and pure water,</p>
<p>Free of living organisms. {11.113}</p>
<p>“The water should be taken, carefully,</p>
<p>From a spotlessly clean and pure dish,</p>
<p>From a big lake, a stream,</p>
<p>A pond, a spring, or a river. {11.114}</p>
<p>“The water must come from a clean place</p>
<p>And be drawn by a pure being.</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner should touch it</p>
<p>Always two or three times. {11.115}</p>
<p>“He should then wash his mouth,</p>
<p>And likewise both his ear lobes,</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>His eyes, the cavities of his nose, and his arms. {11.116}</p>
<p>“He should sprinkle the pure water</p>
<p>On his head and his navel</p>
<p>Five or seven times,</p>
<p>Doing everything according to procedure. {11.117}</p>
<p>“Following a ritually pure regimen,</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner, himself purified,</p>
<p>Should take his alms bowl</p>
<p>And go to a natural receptacle of water {11.118}</p>
<p>“Where a stream of water is dammed,</p>
<p>Or at the water’s spring.</p>
<p>He should always wash the alms</p>
<p>In the current of a flowing river. {11.119}</p>
<p>“After that, he should get up</p>
<p>And go back to his monastery or dwelling.</p>
<p>Whichever dwelling he had stayed at,</p>
<p>There he should go. {11.120}</p>
<p>“Having reached that place,</p>
<p>The reciter should put down his alms bowl.</p>
<p>He should then quickly perform the ritual ablutions,</p>
<p>And take hold of his bowl once again— {11.121}</p>
<p>“A bowl that may be made of clay,</p>
<p>Leaves, silver, gold,</p>
<p>Copper, or cassia bark—</p>
<p>And offer food to his teacher. {11.122}</p>
<p>“Offering the food to one’s teacher,</p>
<p>One should utter either one’s own mantra or the king of mantras.</p>
<p>Welcoming a lone visitor, one should also offer to him</p>
<p>Or to the poor, according to one’s means.{11.123}</p>
<p>“Whenever one offers food,</p>
<p>One does not need to give an excessive amount.</p>
<p>A mantra adept should not do what is damaging to himself,</p>
<p>But always act sensibly. {11.124}</p>
<p>“He should set aside what will fill his stomach;</p>
<p>The rest should always be offered away.</p>
<p>One who is afflicted by hunger and thirst</p>
<p>Will not be able to accomplish his mantra practice. {11.125}</p>
<p>“On the other hand, one who does not eat too much</p>
<p>Or too little will be able to attend to his mantra practice.</p>
<p>The lord of the victorious ones therefore said</p>
<p>About all beings that possess a body,{11.126}</p>
<p>“And who find sustenance in food—</p>
<p>Food that gives life to humans,</p>
<p>Gods, asuras, gandharvas,</p>
<p>Nāgas, yakṣas, or kinnaras, {11.127}</p>
<p>“Rākṣasas, pretas, piśācas,</p>
<p>Bhūtas, utsārakas, and grahas—</p>
<p>That there is not a single one of them</p>
<p>That would not depend on the content of his food bowl. {11.128}</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata has proclaimed</p>
<p>That some beings live on material foods</p>
<p>That are taken by mouth,</p>
<p>While others depend on subtle foods. {11.129}</p>
<p>“Deities who inhabit the form realm</p>
<p>Live on the food of dhyāna;</p>
<p>Gods in the formless realm</p>
<p>Are nourished by the fruits of samādhi. {11.130}</p>
<p>“Beings in the intermediate state</p>
<p>Are said to depend on food too.</p>
<p>Beings in the desire realm</p>
<p>Are nourished by a wide variety of foods.</p>
<p>Gods of the desire realm, asuras, and humans</p>
<p>Live on foods that are taken by mouth.{11.131}</p>
<p>“It has been taught therefore by the victorious lords</p>
<p>That based upon karmic causes,</p>
<p>Sentient beings are sustained by food;</p>
<p>This is well known to all. {11.132}</p>
<p>“For someone who always engages in mantra recitation</p>
<p>The act of eating is a matter of necessity.</p>
<p>One who relies on food</p>
<p>Will be able to practice the mantras. {11.133}</p>
<p>“If one’s conduct is completely pure,</p>
<p>And one is competent and lives a celibate life,</p>
<p>Such a mantra adept, relying on food,</p>
<p>Will attain accomplishment without difficulty. {11.134}</p>
<p>“He is then like a carter of a cart</p>
<p>Who has oiled the axles well,</p>
<p>Because he can [travel] for a long time</p>
<p>And is able to convey heavy loads. {11.135}</p>
<p>“So, too, a mantra adept with knowledge of mantras</p>
<p>Should use food for sustenance.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should always take nourishment</p>
<p>For the upkeep and sustenance of his body, {11.136}</p>
<p>“As this is necessary for the accomplishment of mantras</p>
<p>And also constitutes a cause for the two provisions for awakening.</p>
<p>Consequently, one should recite the mantras,</p>
<p>As this benefits beings in this world of mortals.{11.137}</p>
<p>“For this reason the supreme sage,</p>
<p>The previous buddha known as Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>One of great splendor, taught</p>
<p>At that time, on that occasion, upon the earth. {11.138}</p>
<p>“He taught the following mantra</p>
<p>For the well-being of living beings—</p>
<p>All those afflicted by suffering,</p>
<p>Miserable, stricken with poverty, {11.139}</p>
<p>“Weary, resigned, and oppressed;</p>
<p>For their sake he spoke this mantra.</p>
<p>He taught it for the welfare of beings</p>
<p>Who keep circling in saṃsāra.</p>
<p>He taught this best of all mantras</p>
<p>So that beings may find nourishment.{11.140}</p>
<p>“He said, ‘May all the śrāvakas and all the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Who reside in awakening, listen.</p>
<p>Please receive from me the words of this mantra,</p>
<p>The mantra that removes all ailments. {11.141}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those of you who are oppressed by the scourge of hunger,</p>
<p>And those who are thirsty,</p>
<p>Hear [this mantra] to have all your suffering pacified;</p>
<p>Those desiring prosperity, listen well!’{11.142}</p>
<p>“At these words of the supreme sage,</p>
<p>Kāśyapa of great splendor,</p>
<p>All the śrāvakas, their hearts full of joy,</p>
<p>Supplicated the Sage thus: {11.143}</p>
<p>“ ‘Please tell us this mantra, O great sage,</p>
<p>O Dharma king who knows Dharma!</p>
<p>You care for living beings in the utmost.</p>
<p>The time has now arrived.’ {11.144}</p>
<p>“Having been thus addressed, the best of sages</p>
<p>Taught the mantra in full.</p>
<p>With the sound of his voice, sweet as a cuckoo bird’s</p>
<p>And as powerful as a drum or a thunderclap,{11.145}</p>
<p>“This great, valiant man with the voice of Brahmā,</p>
<p>The Victorious One, the foremost of brahmins, said,</p>
<p>‘Please listen, O hosts of beings</p>
<p>Who have assembled here. {11.146}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will now say, for the sake of all beings,</p>
<p>Whether they are legless, many legged,</p>
<p>Two legged, or four legged,</p>
<p>The mantra that brings happiness. {11.147}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will say it for the sake of past and future beings,</p>
<p>And also beings of the present time who have assembled here.</p>
<p>I will speak briefly, so please listen</p>
<p>If you desire prosperity. {11.148}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers. The mantra is:</p>
<p>“ ‘Oṁ, bring everyone to your celestial palace in the sky, quick, quick! Remember your samaya pledge! O summoner, do not tarry, do not tarry! Give me good fortune’</p>
<p>“Having said this, Lord Kāśyapa remained silent. {11.149}</p>
<p>“As soon as Lord Kāśyapa, the perfectly awakened one, spoke the words of this mantra in full, the entire sky appeared filled with a cloud consisting of choicest foodstuffs. The entire great trichiliocosm appeared to have its sky canopied with a cloud consisting of food. Whatever food the beings  desired to satisfy their individual needs, whatever food they wished for, that had manifested for them. Whatever food preparations the beings desired to appease the pains of hunger, whatever drinks the thirsty ones wanted to drink, a stream of water along with the eight articles of offering, [all this] fell down exactly wherever it was wished for. {11.150}</p>
<p>“All the beings, for their part, had on that occasion, at that particular time, the suffering of their hunger completely pacified and all their thirst completely removed. The entire assembly became greatly amazed and elated and rejoiced at the Blessed One’s words. Joyfully they bowed their heads to his feet and disappeared at that very moment. Lord Kāśyapa, for his part, said, ‘Lord Śākyamuni and I sojourned on earth as tathāgatas. At that time this mantra was taught in this king of manuals and celebrated.’{11.151}</p>
<p>“This mantra ought to be accomplished for the benefit of all beings, in particular the mantra reciters, to remove their hunger and thirst, just as it was previously accomplished by the reciter [Kāśyapa]. If one does not feel up to wandering around for the sake of alms, one should climb to a mountaintop and recite that mantra six hundred thousand times, living on the three pure food products or milk dishes. {11.152}</p>
<p>“There, on the mountaintop, one should install the medium painting of Noble Mañjuśrī and, as before, offer a big pūjā [followed] by a big bali offering of food. Employing the mantra taught by Kāśyapa and other perfectly awakened buddhas, one should make a fire of cutch tree sticks and offer into it, [while reciting the mantra], one thousand and eight sticks of either the cluster fig or bilva tree, nine inches long, [moist with sap], and smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. {11.153}</p>
<p>“Then, at the midnight hour, a great whirlwind will arrive in the form of a black cloud.  One should not be afraid, nor should one get up or approach it. Just as before, one should effect protection for oneself and the protective binding of the maṇḍala for one’s companions by means of the eight-syllable heart mantra of Noble Mañjuśrī. The black whirlwind will subsequently disappear, and in front of the practitioner will appear women adorned with all types of jewelry. One of them, with a halo of light illuminating the space around her, will say, ‘Rise up, O great being! You have reached accomplishment.’{11.154}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should then give her a welcome offering of water with floating jasmine flowers. At that very moment she will disappear. On that very day, she will give to the practitioner and twenty-five of his companions, or whomever the practitioner fancies, foodstuffs and any useful objects that they may want. At that point the practitioner should give a farewell offering and circumambulate the painting clockwise three times. He should then take the painting, bow to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas three times, and go to a place of his choice that is conducive to sādhana practice as previously described, such as a big forest, a mountaintop, or any uninhabited place. There, he should build a hut and live there alone or with companions. While living there, he should do the rites that involve sky travel, and so forth. {11.155}</p>
<p>“As before, the practitioner should sit on a bundle of kuśa grass, place the medium painting before himself, and, as before, light a fire of cutch tree sticks. He should offer one thousand and eight oblations of white flowers smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, three times a day for twenty-one days. {11.156}</p>
<p>“Then, at the end of the homa ritual, at the midnight hour, one will see Noble Mañjuśrī in person. He will grant a desired boon, such as the ability to fly,  become invisible, an attainment of a bodhisattva level, the state of a pratyeka­buddha or a śrāvaka, the five superknowledges, long life, a great kingdom with its many pleasures, the affection of a king, or the ability to commune with Noble Mañjuśrī himself. In short, he will grant whatever one may wish for. Or whatever one may ask for, that he will give. One may obtain all the power substances or be able to magically summon great beings. In short, he will do anything the way it is described to him. He may also purify one’s former transgressions. This was taught by Lord Śākyamuni. {11.157}</p>
<p>“Another practice procedure that constitutes the means of accomplishing medium rites will now be taught. To start, one should select a place in a clean area or a sandy bank of a river, distinguished by the necessary qualities, and do everything as before. One should position the painting to face west, with oneself facing east. Sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass, one should repeat in full the same procedure as before. One should recite the mantra at the three junctions of the day six hundred thousand times. At the end of the recitation, one should offer into the fire, prepared exactly as before, one hundred thousand blossoms of the bayur tree mixed with white sandalwood or saffron. {11.158}</p>
<p>“If the painting trembles violently at the conclusion of the homa ritual, it is a sign that one will become a minister. If the painting becomes luminous with light and rays of light issue forth from it, one will obtain a kingship. If the painting is completely enveloped in a halo of light, one will obtain the kingship over the realm of the four great kings. If the painting speaks, one will obtain the position of Śakra—dominion over the realm of the Thirty-Three. If the painting delivers Dharma instructions, one will attain lordship of the [first] three bodhisattva levels. If one touches one’s head and arms with the painting, one will obtain the five superknowledges, the seventh bodhisattva level, and the ten powers. One will certainly obtain them one after the other. {11.159}</p>
<p>“When one has accomplished the mantra taught by Lord Kāśyapa and achieved the goal of removing hunger and thirst, one should practice the teachings on the method for accomplishing the goal of mantra activity, strictly following the procedure and using the specified implements. Otherwise one will not succeed. {11.160}</p>
<p>“In brief, one should follow the mantra practice step by step in this way, and one will certainly succeed. One will definitely obtain all the power substances, special implements, and medicines, as well as jewels and gems as previously described. {11.161}</p>
<p>“A mantra reciter skilled in the art of mantra,</p>
<p>Who is familiar with the ritual procedure,</p>
<p>Staying in a place as described above,</p>
<p>Should eat pure and ‘white’ foods.{11.162}</p>
<p>“Having eaten, happy at heart,</p>
<p>With his sense organs always well nourished,</p>
<p>He should take his bowl with the remaining food</p>
<p>And go to a river with clean water. {11.163}</p>
<p>“The vow holder should throw the food in an isolated place</p>
<p>And leave it for animals.</p>
<p>Having given it to them,</p>
<p>He should wash his bowl thoroughly. {11.164}</p>
<p>“The bowl should be made of clay</p>
<p>And carefully fired.</p>
<p>After using it, one should remove from the bowl</p>
<p>All traces of grease or meat{11.165}</p>
<p>“And ensure there is no residual smell—</p>
<p>The supreme sage said this about the bowl when it is not used.</p>
<p>One should never eat from the bowl</p>
<p>That one uses for doing alms rounds. {11.166}</p>
<p>“One should never eat solid foods from it,</p>
<p>Nor fruits, or liquids.</p>
<p>One should not eat from a lotus leaf</p>
<p>Or leaves produced by water lilies. {11.167}</p>
<p>“One should avoid leaves of fragrant plants—</p>
<p>A mantra practitioner should not use them,</p>
<p>Nor the leaves of water lilies</p>
<p>Or those that grow on the waved-leaf fig or cluster fig tree. {11.168}</p>
<p>“Nor should one use banyan leaves,</p>
<p>Or those from karṇa, śāka, or gulmin trees,</p>
<p>And neither the leaves that grow on mango trees</p>
<p>Nor leaves from the dhak tree. {11.169}</p>
<p>“Nor should one use leaves from the sal tree, flea tree,</p>
<p>Or those that grow on bodhi trees—</p>
<p>This is because the blessed Buddha Śākyamuni</p>
<p>Used to sit on them. {11.170}</p>
<p>“One should carefully avoid these trees,</p>
<p>And never fell them for timber.</p>
<p>One should not pluck leaves</p>
<p>From ironwood trees. {11.171}</p>
<p>“One should never eat from any of them,</p>
<p>As they are all avoided by the wise.</p>
<p>Sages who dwell in huts of leaves</p>
<p>Must never step over [such leaves]. {11.172}</p>
<p>“A mantra practitioner would break his samaya</p>
<p>Should he eat from the leaves of these trees.</p>
<p>He should also not eat</p>
<p>From the leaves of other trees.{11.173}</p>
<p>“One can always take food from dishes</p>
<p>As recommended, made of clay, copper,</p>
<p>Silver, gold-based materials,</p>
<p>And also quartz or stone. {11.174}</p>
<p>“One should not eat from the backside of a leaf,</p>
<p>Nor from the surface of the hand.</p>
<p>Those leaves that may serve as an offering</p>
<p>For the sons of the possessors of the ten powers, the enemies of Māra,{11.175}</p>
<p>“Or those that may be offered to the rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>Or, indeed, to the śrāvaka followers</p>
<p>Should be avoided by a mantra reciter,</p>
<p>And never trampled underfoot. {11.176}</p>
<p>“As for the different bakery items,</p>
<p>And food and drink in general,</p>
<p>A mantra practitioner should not appropriate</p>
<p>Anything that has been duly offered. {11.177}</p>
<p>“A reciter should always avoid</p>
<p>What has been given to the victorious ones,</p>
<p>To their followers, the śrāvakas,</p>
<p>And to the Three Jewels. {11.178}</p>
<p>“For those ordinary beings for whom this is even slightly the case,</p>
<p>The mantras will accomplish nothing;</p>
<p>What need then to speak of high qualities,</p>
<p>Or those who desire every fortune? {11.179}</p>
<p>“The mantras of those who eat food offered as bali</p>
<p>Will not be successful,</p>
<p>Whether in the rites of enriching or pacifying,</p>
<p>Or having any hopes fulfilled. {11.180}</p>
<p>“The mantras, on the other hand, of pure, skilled, disciplined,</p>
<p>And tenderhearted followers of the Dharma</p>
<p>Will be successful in every respect,</p>
<p>If they take joy in their pure conduct. {11.181}</p>
<p>“A reciter should not eat food</p>
<p>Already given by him to anyone else,</p>
<p>Nor should he eat the food</p>
<p>Given by others to someone else.{11.182}</p>
<p>“One should eat little, and only that</p>
<p>Which has been given to oneself.</p>
<p>A mantra adept who lives in this way</p>
<p>Already has an accomplishment in his hand. {11.183}</p>
<p>“The mantrin,  the keeper of vows,</p>
<p>Should receive food following this procedure</p>
<p>And should practice all the mantras</p>
<p>Commended by the sages. {11.184}</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I will now explain in brief</p>
<p>The rules pertaining to rites</p>
<p>For using all types of food,</p>
<p>And I will also teach a mantra that purifies everything.{11.185}</p>
<p>“When a reciter has done his ritual ablutions,</p>
<p>He should always recite the following mantra.</p>
<p>Having recited it seven times,</p>
<p>This mantra practitioner will have purified his body. {11.186}</p>
<p>“Hear it and learn its full meaning,</p>
<p>O assembly of spirits and deities!</p>
<p>Having rubbed his entire body,</p>
<p>A sage should recite the following mantra. {11.187}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is as follows:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you who remove all faults, destroy, destroy all those who engage in evil! Remember your samaya! Hūṁ jaḥ, svāhā!{11.188}</p>
<p>“Whatever rice dishes one has obtained through alms, or any other food that one is going to eat, one should eat it after incanting it with the above mantra. Having eaten and ritually rinsed one’s mouth, one should wash the whole body as before, in the direction toward the head, and then take rest. Having rested for three quarters of an hour, or half of a half of one night-watch, one should respectfully salute the painting and recite genuine Dharma texts taught by all the buddhas.{11.189}</p>
<p>“The texts to be recited are the noble Prajñāpāramitā, Candra­pradīpa­samādhi,Daśabhūmika,Suvarṇa­prabhāsottama, Mahā­māyūrī, or Ratna­ketu­dhāraṇī. One should recite them in turns, until the sun has risen one angular cubit above the horizon. Then, when one has finished reading and bowed down to one’s ability, one should put the books aside and cover them with a clean cloth. Having bowed to this work of Dharma, one should descend to a riverbank or a big pond in order to bathe. There, one should take some clay that is free of living organisms, incant it seven times  with the following mantra, and throw it into the water. What mantra? {11.190}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers. The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, paralyze all evildoers, hūṁ! You who hold a blue lotus and possess the graceful form of a divine youth, bind them, bind! Remember your samaya! Phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!{11.191}</p>
<p>“One should use this mantra to effect protection [for oneself], bind the directions, form a protective circle for one’s companions, bind the fire pit, and summon all the wicked and utterly wicked beings. With this mantra one can also arrest semen. One should roam everywhere with a cord tied around one’s waist and incanted seven times. One should recite this mantra one hundred thousand times in order to destroy or appease the evil obstacle makers, reciting both during recitation sessions and the time of ritual bathing. In this way one will be able to accomplish all activities. When performing any ritual, one should put on the great fivefold seal [of Mañjuśrī]. One will be able to accomplish everything; it cannot be otherwise.{11.192}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should take some powder consisting of dried clay and cow dung and do the ritual ablutions as he pleases. He should bathe in water that is free of living organisms. In all the rites, one should always use only water that is free of living organisms. Having bathed, one should smear oneself with a paste of clay and cow dung, or other fragrant unguents that are especially helpful. One must not release into the water any phlegm, urine, or feces. One should not splash in the water or engage in play. One should compassionately reflect on oneself and others and on the absence of self, emptiness, and the pain of experiencing pervasive suffering, which is like the pain experienced by someone separated from their mother. A mantra adept should thus imagine himself to be a being without a practice to follow, one subject to ruin, fall, decay, and destruction, all of which are attended by suffering. He should think of himself as sinking deep into the ocean of saṃsāra,  without a place to rest, protection, or refuge, and miserable. He should thus meditate, focusing his mind one-pointedly, while standing right there surrounded by water, submerged up to his neck or his waist. {11.193}</p>
<p>“First one should visualize a huge lotus stalk supporting a big lotus flower. It is adorned with big petals and made of beautiful-looking jewels. Its pericarp is of beryl, its petals of emerald, and its stamens of crystal. It has one thousand petals and is in full bloom. It is adorned with flowers made of crystal and ruby. On this lotus there is a lotus throne made of precious stone, adorned with many gems, and shaded by a pair of cloth canopies. On the throne, one should visualize Lord Buddha expounding the Dharma. He is of pure golden color, surrounded by bright light, and adorned with a halo one fathom wide. He is large in size, appearing as if painted in the sky, and sitting in a cross-legged posture. {11.194}</p>
<p>“To his right, on a lotus seat, one should visualize Noble Mañjuśrī, adorned with all the superb ornaments. He is not sitting but standing, and holding, in his extended hand, a yak-tail whisk to fan the Blessed One. He is of light red hue or the color of ground saffron. To the left of the Blessed One, there is the noble Avalokiteśvara, the color of a full autumn moon, with a yak-tail whisk in his hand. Similarly, the eight bodhisattvas—the noble Maitreya, Samantabhadra, Kṣitigarbha, Gaganagañja, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Apāyajaha, the noble Vajrapāṇi, and Sudhana—should be visualized. These are the ten bodhisattvas. {11.195}</p>
<p>“To the right, one should visualize the eight pratyeka­buddhas—Candana, Gandhamādana, Ketu, Suketu, Sitaketu, Riṣṭa, Upāriṣṭa, and Nemi.  In the same place there are also the eight great śrāvakas—the noble Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Śāriputra, Gavāmpati, Piṇḍola­bhara­dvāja, Pilindavatsa, the noble Rāhula, Mahākāśyapa, and the noble Ānanda. {11.196}</p>
<p>“Next to these eight great śrāvakas, one should visualize an infinite assembly of monks; next to the pratyeka­buddhas, an infinite numbers of other pratyeka­buddhas; and in the eight places of the eight great bodhisattvas, infinite assemblies of other bodhisattvas. In this auspicious way should one visualize the canopy of the sky filled with this great assembly. {11.197}</p>
<p>“Still standing in water reaching up to one’s navel, one should perform a big pūjā, offering flowers of many types, earthly and celestial, including māndarava and great māndarava, lotuses and great lotuses, or, according to season, blue lotuses—different flowers of great size, baskets with flowers, and flowers piled as high as a mountain. Also, one should perform a pūjā, pleasing to the mind, for all the śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, and bodhisattvas, offering fragrant powders, parasols, flags, and banners—both earthly and celestial, in great numbers—including thousands of millions of billions of bright lamps. One should offer, in the same manner, requisites and articles used for a bali offering, such as incense and food. {11.198}</p>
<p>“One should then visualize oneself and everything illumined by the light issuing forth from the tuft of hair between Lord Śākyamuni’s eyebrows. Immediately entering samādhi while reciting the mantra, one will obtain fruits of the accumulated great merit and will certainly become destined for awakening. {11.199}</p>
<p>“This and similar meditations</p>
<p>Were taught by the best of men</p>
<p>For the sake of all beings’ welfare</p>
<p>And for the benefit of mantra practitioners. {11.200}</p>
<p>“The supreme seventh sage</p>
<p>Taught at that time the most important meditation,</p>
<p>For the benefit of all mantra practitioners</p>
<p>And for all sentient beings. {11.201}</p>
<p>“He taught the features and appearance</p>
<p>Of the first, the second,</p>
<p>And the third maṇḍalas,</p>
<p>And after that, he taught the mantra.{11.202}</p>
<p>“The best of men declared that</p>
<p>With the first type of painting, the accomplishment will be supreme;</p>
<p>With the second, it will be inferior to that;</p>
<p>And with the smallest, the accomplishment will be very small. {11.203}</p>
<p>“Just as with the form of the painting, so too</p>
<p>Can the meditation be supreme, medium, or smallest.</p>
<p>In short, though, this meditation</p>
<p>Will remove all of one’s faults.{11.204}</p>
<p>“There is nothing else to rely on</p>
<p>Than the mode of meditation the wise one uses;</p>
<p>His mantras will be successful,</p>
<p>And he will be stable in his meditation. {11.205}</p>
<p>“When the reciter has finished his chosen meditation</p>
<p>That has been taught according to its procedure,</p>
<p>He should request the mantra deity to depart,</p>
<p>Using whatever offering he finds pleasing. {11.206}</p>
<p>“He should then come out of the water stream</p>
<p>And go, as he pleases,</p>
<p>To a place as described before,</p>
<p>Applying self-control according to rules. {11.207}</p>
<p>“A mantra practitioner should recite the mantra</p>
<p>As prescribed for the previous rite.</p>
<p>He should then request the mantra deity,</p>
<p>And whatever deities had been summoned, to depart.{11.208}</p>
<p>“Next, the skilled practitioner should perform</p>
<p>The protection rite for himself and his friends,</p>
<p>While knowing the true nature of the ritual</p>
<p>And taking pleasure in following its procedure. {11.209}</p>
<p>“One should praise the best of beings</p>
<p>By offering various eulogies,</p>
<p>And thus supplicating one’s mantra deity, the lord of mantras,</p>
<p>The śrāvakas, the rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas, {11.210}</p>
<p>“And the bodhisattvas, these great beings</p>
<p>Who are forbearingly kind toward the three realms.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should then</p>
<p>Get up from his seat once again {11.211}</p>
<p>“And, having gone some distance from his dwelling,</p>
<p>Should expel his breath completely,</p>
<p>Discharge mucous and spittle,</p>
<p>And void his bladder.{11.212}</p>
<p>“During the daytime one should face north,</p>
<p>And at nighttime, south.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should never</p>
<p>Wish for material benefits. {11.213}</p>
<p>“He should not recite, for this purpose, the mantra,</p>
<p>Nor should he talk about his family and its activities.</p>
<p>A practitioner of impeccable conduct,</p>
<p>Adorned with auspicious marks, should sit on the ground. {11.214}</p>
<p>“He should perform ablutions in pure water</p>
<p>That reaches up to the hem of his robe,</p>
<p>And thoroughly wash his feet,</p>
<p>Wiping them seven times with clay.{11.215}</p>
<p>“After urinating, he should use seven handfuls,</p>
<p>After passing stool, use thirty handfuls,</p>
<p>And clean his hands afterward.</p>
<p>When clearing phlegm or snot,</p>
<p>He should take two handfuls of clay.{11.216}</p>
<p>“One should perform one’s toilet carefully,</p>
<p>In a place far from one’s dwelling.</p>
<p>One should go to where no sound is heard,</p>
<p>And where all paths disappear.{11.217}</p>
<p>“There, at one’s pleasure,</p>
<p>Outside the southern boundary,</p>
<p>In a pit submerged in saline water</p>
<p>And covered over with sand, {11.218}</p>
<p>“But not on a riverbank—</p>
<p>One should avoid polluting them with feces—</p>
<p>In a covered and secret place where one feels at ease,</p>
<p>In a wilderness devoid of people, {11.219}</p>
<p>“Can a mantra practitioner go to the toilet</p>
<p>To void his body of impurities.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should know the right time</p>
<p>And not hold in feces for too long. {11.220}</p>
<p>“One should therefore go, whenever one feels like it,</p>
<p>To a clean and deserted spot as prescribed</p>
<p>And build there a toilet-cabin</p>
<p>The way one wants. {11.221}</p>
<p>“One should always relieve oneself</p>
<p>In silence, without any company,</p>
<p>In a secret and hidden hut,</p>
<p>Or a place concealed by the terrain. {11.222}</p>
<p>“When urine and stool have been evacuated,</p>
<p>A vow holder should always clean himself</p>
<p>Using soft and well-kneaded clay,</p>
<p>Free of living organisms. {11.223}</p>
<p>“One should divide the clay into three lumps and always use one</p>
<p>To clean one’s anus and the remaining two to clean each hand.</p>
<p>A mantra practitioner should always collect the clay</p>
<p>From the ground as described before {11.224}</p>
<p>“And thoroughly wash his feet,</p>
<p>First the right, then the left.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should ensure</p>
<p>That the feet do not touch each other.{11.225}</p>
<p>“The personal hygiene of mantra reciters</p>
<p>Has been taught at length before.</p>
<p>The pure beings have formerly taught</p>
<p>The purificatory toilet involving perfume and unguents.</p>
<p>This purification procedure will now be summarized</p>
<p>For the sake of those who follow the rules of mantra. {11.226}</p>
<p>“The lord of sages has said</p>
<p>That one should always stay pure</p>
<p>Through a toilet involving perfume and unguents,</p>
<p>As has been indicated in this entire tantra. {11.227}</p>
<p>“One should perform ablutions while reciting the mantra,</p>
<p>Delighting, like a devotee, in the rites that are successful,</p>
<p>Following the method as previously taught,</p>
<p>With one’s mind inwardly pure. {11.228}</p>
<p>“In all the tantras the purity</p>
<p>Of mantra practitioners is taught to be fivefold.</p>
<p>Purity of the body, purity of speech,</p>
<p>And purity of mind are taught as three;</p>
<p>Fourth is the purity of truth,</p>
<p>And fifth is the purity of water.{11.229}</p>
<p>“One needs to abide by the law of truth, control one’s anger,</p>
<p>Understand the teachings of the tantras, know the śāstras,</p>
<p>Be proficient in understanding the significance of the subtle nature,</p>
<p>Understand the mantras, and know the rituals. {11.230}</p>
<p>“For those with both inner and outer skills,</p>
<p>Accomplishment will not be difficult to find.</p>
<p>One should not utter false and disrespectful words</p>
<p>That are devoid of the quality of truth; {11.231}</p>
<p>“Words that are cruel, cruel in the extreme,</p>
<p>Or devoid of any truth;</p>
<p>Words that sow mutual hatred and anger;</p>
<p>Harsh words that attack someone’s weaknesses; {11.232}</p>
<p>“Words devoid of truth or justice</p>
<p>That hurt other beings;</p>
<p>Or slanderous words born out of an afflicted mind</p>
<p>That have no virtue in them at all. {11.233}</p>
<p>“So, too, one should always avoid intrinsically harmful words</p>
<p>That spring from wrong morality and do not accord with the Dharma.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should likewise always avoid</p>
<p>The vulgar pursuits of common people. {11.234}</p>
<p>“All the buddhas, bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>And other wise beings condemn</p>
<p>The misguided ire of</p>
<p>Those who fear the next world.{11.235}</p>
<p>“Certainly, too, the rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>And the śrāvakas, time and again,</p>
<p>Condemn false speech for those people</p>
<p>Who desire accomplishment in this world. {11.236}</p>
<p>“One who speaks false words</p>
<p>Will go to a most terrible hell,</p>
<p>Then to the animal realm,</p>
<p>And after that to Yama’s world of hungry ghosts. {11.237}</p>
<p>“One who makes one’s living by telling lies</p>
<p>Will have to stay there continually.</p>
<p>Such a feeble-minded being will go to the terrible</p>
<p>Kālasūtra or Pratāpana hell, {11.238}</p>
<p>“Or Sañjīva, Asipattra,</p>
<p>Or perhaps Śālmalīvana,</p>
<p>Where a person who speaks untruth</p>
<p>Will remain for many eons. {11.239}</p>
<p>“How could the mantras of a liar</p>
<p>Ever bring accomplishment?</p>
<p>One who deceives beings with false words</p>
<p>Only brings them distress.</p>
<p>One whose actions are so deluded</p>
<p>Is therefore not going to see mantra accomplishment. {11.240}</p>
<p>“There will be no accomplishment for the followers of mantra</p>
<p>Who utter words in the manner just described.</p>
<p>How could they win accomplishment,</p>
<p>Even after many eons—tens of millions? {11.241}</p>
<p>“One who rejects, on this earth,</p>
<p>The teaching of the buddhas</p>
<p>Will fall into the terrible</p>
<p>And very frightening Avīci hell. {11.242}</p>
<p>“In the Sañjīva, Kālasūtra,</p>
<p>Or Pratāpana hell</p>
<p>One will remain for one great eon,</p>
<p>If one shuns these genuine instructions of mine. {11.243}</p>
<p>“Foolish people will be cooked</p>
<p>In a frighteningly dark hell,</p>
<p>If, blind and veiled by darkness,</p>
<p>They disdain the genuine teachings. {11.244}</p>
<p>“Because of their ignorance and childish nature,</p>
<p>They are deluded by their false pride.</p>
<p>Slighting the vidyārāja,</p>
<p>They will fall into a terrible hell. {11.245}</p>
<p>“One should therefore refrain from committing evil,</p>
<p>Or any contemptible falsehood.</p>
<p>Genuine Dharma must not be despised,</p>
<p>And wrong views must be rejected. {11.246}</p>
<p>“Consequently, one should always have faith</p>
<p>And always follow the mantra procedure.</p>
<p>One who knows the mantra should speak the truth,</p>
<p>Always for the good of sentient beings.</p>
<p>If such a one resorts to the mantra,</p>
<p>He will certainly obtain accomplishment.{11.247}</p>
<p>“The (ritual) performance makes for the (ritual) activity;</p>
<p>Such activity would not happen without the performance.</p>
<p>One thus performs various activities (and creates various karmas)</p>
<p>Of the sublime, medium, and lower types.</p>
<p>One who thus engages in ritual activity</p>
<p>Will always obtain accomplishment.{11.248}</p>
<p>“In terms of purpose, the only purpose of ritual performance</p>
<p>Is always for the sake of aim-oriented activity.</p>
<p>Ritual performance without a motive is a kriyā (mere performance),</p>
<p>Whereas ritual performance with a motive is a karman (retributive activity).</p>
<p>As activity that relies on ritual bears results,</p>
<p>One should always perform rituals.{11.249}</p>
<p>“First the required procedure, then the activity, and then the result—</p>
<p>This is always the order in which these three occur.</p>
<p>That which bears no result (that is, the procedure on its own) becomes that which</p>
<p>Produces the result (the activity), thus always ending with the result.{11.250}</p>
<p>“With results or without them—</p>
<p>These are the only possible outcomes.</p>
<p>A mantra is accomplished through union;</p>
<p>This union is what brings the accomplishment of mantra.</p>
<p>The absence of union is separation,</p>
<p>And separation, unlike union, is not effective.{11.251}</p>
<p>“Accomplishment—the accomplishing of what is to be accomplished—</p>
<p>Will not be won in that case.</p>
<p>The power substances—the causes of accomplishment—</p>
<p>Will be blocked in every respect.{11.252}</p>
<p>“For those, however, who have accomplished their mantra,</p>
<p>Even the mantras they have not previously accomplished bring results.</p>
<p>The activity primarily intended by the performer</p>
<p>Is the result of the procedure enacted for the purpose of this activity. {11.253}</p>
<p>“In all activities one should not perform that which is ineffectual.</p>
<p>Since the [effective] activity has its causes,</p>
<p>Which are the mantra, the tantra, and the intention,</p>
<p>One should always commence an activity employing [these causes]. {11.254}</p>
<p>“One should perform activities that are viable (ārabhya);</p>
<p>One should not undertake activities that are ineffectual.</p>
<p>Mantras that are not part of a ritual performance</p>
<p>Will not bring accomplishment to anyone. {11.255}</p>
<p>“The samaya, formerly taught by the supreme sages—</p>
<p>The teachers of the true Dharma—</p>
<p>Has been explained by the victorious ones</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Mantra Vehicle.{11.256}</p>
<p>“The practitioner who knows the complete doctrine of the mantra</p>
<p>Has been shown, in this matchless king of manuals,</p>
<p>The path that results in awakening—</p>
<p>The path whose nature (rūpa) is mantra. {11.257}</p>
<p>“All mantras for which the lineage connection</p>
<p>Is always present will be successful.</p>

<p>Within a short period of time. {11.258}</p>
<p>“For the sake of pacifying every being,</p>
<p>The perfect buddhas taught</p>
<p>The path that consists of mantra,</p>
<p>Which leads to the city of nirvāṇa.{11.259}</p>
<p>“Thus, the path to awakening</p>
<p>Always fulfills the purpose of all activities.</p>
<p>Buddhahood is its place of origin</p>
<p>And its ultimate and final aim. {11.260}</p>
<p>“If effected through mantra recitation,</p>
<p>This path will be accomplished without effort,</p>
<p>And its results will be obtained</p>
<p>Along with the knowledge of various karmic predispositions.{11.261}</p>
<p>“In brief, this attainment will come</p>
<p>To those with discipline, meditation, and [the three] liberations,</p>
<p>And it will fulfill for them all aims—</p>
<p>This has been taught by the chief among the victors. {11.262}</p>
<p>“One will obtain an increase in riches,</p>
<p>Reside in the ultimate realm,</p>
<p>Or be the leader, in any event, of the yakṣas</p>
<p>And the sovereign of gods and men.{11.263}</p>
<p>“One who [knows] all mantras</p>
<p>Will obtain supremacy</p>
<p>Over men, gods, and asuras,</p>
<p>And will make his rites bear fruit.{11.264}</p>
<p>“One should always practice pure conduct</p>
<p>And take joy in discipline and meditation.</p>
<p>A mantra practitioner should recite the mantra</p>
<p>That has been taught in all the tantras. {11.265}</p>
<p>“The mantra practitioner may perform the various types of rites,</p>
<p>Such as those of the highest or middling type.</p>
<p>If, however, he desires riches,</p>
<p>He should perform those of the lowest type.{11.266}</p>
<p>“The lowest rites will bring an increase of pleasures;</p>
<p>The middling will bring a superior body.</p>
<p>The reciter will, however, attain the highest state</p>
<p>Only through the supreme rites. {11.267}</p>
<p>“At the end of recitation, the practitioner should rest,</p>
<p>For as long as necessary;</p>
<p>He should do his formal practice</p>
<p>When the time for it has arrived. {11.268}</p>
<p>“Even though all his rites have succeeded, the mantra practitioner</p>
<p>Should keep reciting in order to exhaust all the evil of human beings.</p>
<p>What is normally done through successive rites,</p>
<p>He can accomplish through a single rite performed according to procedure. {11.269}</p>
<p>“His accomplishment will become stable</p>
<p>When he has acquired all that is possible for human beings to acquire.</p>
<p>Such a mantra reciter should nevertheless continue to recite the mantra</p>
<p>In order to exhaust evil, and then, to remove the karma of beings.{11.270}</p>
<p>“May the mantras revered by the world</p>
<p>That are supreme, middling, or inferior be successful!</p>
<p>When recited they will exhaust all karma</p>
<p>That has been accumulated throughout the succession of births.{11.271}</p>
<p>“The evil of all the embodied beings will then be destroyed.</p>
<p>One will obtain various body ornaments,</p>
<p>Pleasing to the mind and possessed of all good qualities.</p>
<p>One will obtain a place in the Yakṣa,  with the permanent position of a king.</p>
<p>Those who recite the mantra of the tathāgatas</p>
<p>Will obtain every accomplishment.” {11.272}</p>
<p>This concludes the eleventh chapter of “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter constitutes the detailed fourth chapter on places suitable for the performance of the ritual; on mantra recitation, ritual observances, homa, meditation, purificatory rites, and conduct; and the performance of all the rites according to procedure.</p>
<p>Chapter 12</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni again looked at the entire Pure Abode, and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, to [the instructions] for the followers of your vidyā mantra who strive to benefit all beings—what mantras they should be made to recite, by whom these mantras are to be recited, and the attendant rosary rites that are methods for accomplishing all the common mantras of all tantras. Listen carefully and reflect on this well. I will teach this [now].” {12.1}</p>
<p>At these words, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, said this to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Good! May the Blessed One show us the favor of teaching this for the sake of all those who entered the samaya of mantra practice, as well as every other being.” {12.2}</p>
<p>After Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, spoke thus, the Blessed One said this to him:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, as I will teach at length and in detail how beings can accomplish all their aims by applying all the mantra conduct. And how [do they do this]? First there is [the following] mantra. Homage to all the buddhas whose forms are marvelous and inconceivable. It is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, act, act! Accomplish all aims, accomplish! O (female) sky dweller who dumbfounds all the wicked ones, effect the purification! Svāhā!{12.3}</p>
<p>“One should employ this mantra in the rites of crafting all types of rosaries, those that involve cleaning, drilling, threading, separating, and so forth.{12.4}</p>
<p>“First, when making a rosary,</p>
<p>One should incant the tree</p>
<p>Thirty-seven times.</p>
<p>A vow holder should then perform the protection rite. {12.5}</p>
<p>“One should then sleep one night</p>
<p>And in one’s sleep one will see</p>
<p>A nonhuman being, either beautiful</p>
<p>Or ugly, and baring its teeth.</p>
<p>This friendly being will say,</p>
<p>‘Bring me, as is proper, something of value.’{12.6}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should then rise early</p>
<p>And go to the tree that has been indicated,</p>
<p>Unless one saw in one’s dream</p>
<p>A tree that is huge and misshapen. {12.7}</p>
<p>“One should avoid trees of this kind</p>
<p>And go instead to another tree.</p>
<p>A rudrākṣa tree is the best;</p>
<p>The next best is an arjuna tree, {12.8}</p>
<p>“A lucky bean tree, or another good tree</p>
<p>That bears fruit suitable for beads.</p>
<p>One should climb it together with companions</p>
<p>Who are good at climbing trees. {12.9}</p>
<p>“If such a mantra reciter has no companions,</p>
<p>He should climb by himself.</p>
<p>A lay vow holder should climb to the fruit</p>
<p>Located on the uppermost branches.{12.10}</p>
<p>“Never distracted from his task,</p>
<p>He should pick fruits that issue from upper branches.</p>
<p>Having thus obtained fruits from these branches,</p>
<p>He should use them in superior rites. {12.11}</p>
<p>“For it has been taught by the best of men</p>
<p>That when a rite is superior, the accomplishment will be superior too;</p>
<p>When it is middling, the accomplishment will be middling;</p>
<p>And when it is minor, the accomplishment will be minor. {12.12}</p>
<p>“If one takes fruit from them,</p>
<p>One will never be disliked by sentient beings.</p>
<p>If one takes seeds from the western branches,</p>
<p>One’s mantras will be effective in the preparation of power substances. {12.13}</p>
<p>“If the seeds are from the northern branches,</p>
<p>One will always be able to summon yakṣa deities or those of similar stock.</p>
<p>It is said that they should be summoned</p>
<p>For the pacification of all beings.{12.14}</p>
<p>“The gods, asuras, gandharvas,</p>
<p>Kinnaras, and rākṣasas, on the other hand,</p>
<p>Can be summoned in a properly performed rite</p>
<p>In order to provide nourishment to all beings. {12.15}</p>
<p>“One will make all the rites</p>
<p>That are done on earth bear fruit.</p>
<p>If the seeds originate from a branch</p>
<p>That is in the eastern quarter, {12.16}</p>
<p>“One should always employ them zealously</p>
<p>As causes for bringing long life.</p>
<p>Thus, one will always obtain a different mantra-accomplishment</p>
<p>Depending on the type of seeds. {12.17}</p>
<p>“If a branch extends in the southern direction</p>
<p>And abounds in leaves,</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should carefully avoid it,</p>
<p>For the seeds from it will drain the vital force from living beings. {12.18}</p>
<p>“If one recites using the seeds</p>
<p>That are growing</p>
<p>On branches extending south,</p>
<p>One will destroy the life force of one’s enemies.{12.19}</p>
<p>“One should carefully avoid such acts, though,</p>
<p>For they are the cause of a great deal of negativity.</p>
<p>Seeds that are described as hanging</p>
<p>Underneath the lower branches {12.20}</p>
<p>“Will enable one to reach Rasātala,</p>
<p>The place where dānava women live,</p>
<p>If one takes along a rosary made of them.</p>
<p>So have these seeds been described.{12.21}</p>
<p>“Seeds that cling to the lower branches</p>
<p>Will enable one to reach Pātāla.</p>
<p>Once he has entered there,</p>
<p>Divine pleasures await a mantra reciter. {12.22}</p>
<p>“He will remain united with asura women</p>
<p>And stay there for an eon.</p>
<p>A reciter will be able to descend there</p>
<p>If he takes with him a complete set of such seeds.{12.23}</p>
<p>“One should perform a protection rite</p>
<p>And travel, with companions, to a place of one’s choice.</p>
<p>Having thus traveled to a distant place,</p>
<p>Which always must be clean,{12.24}</p>
<p>“A mantra practitioner should stay there.</p>
<p>He should purify the set of seeds,</p>
<p>Taking each of the seed-beads</p>
<p>And cleaning it thoroughly all over. {12.25}</p>
<p>“Having cleaned them completely,</p>
<p>The mantra adept should drill holes in them.</p>
<p>Repeating the mantra three, seven, eight,</p>
<p>One, or twenty-one times, {12.26}</p>
<p>“One who knows the nature of mantra should purify the beads.</p>
<p>Always using the same mantra as before,</p>
<p>Repeated either seven or eight times,</p>
<p>The purification will be ensured. {12.27}</p>
<p>“Such a lay vow holder should prepare twine</p>
<p>Using thread spun by a virgin</p>
<p>Joined with five threefold strains</p>
<p>Of fibers from a lotus stalk. {12.28}</p>
<p>“One who knows the nature of mantra should string upon it</p>
<p>Seeds that are fine, well rounded,</p>
<p>Never damaged by worms,</p>
<p>And without protrusions or other imperfections. {12.29}</p>
<p>“They must be beautiful and of nice color,</p>
<p>Without holes or cracks,</p>
<p>And may be either from the rudrākṣa tree,</p>
<p>Lucky bean tree, or arjuna tree. {12.30}</p>
<p>“Applying himself to the task with care,</p>
<p>A mantra practitioner should string a rosary of beads</p>
<p>That is ever unspoiled, beautiful,</p>
<p>Not deformed, and composed of identical beads.{12.31}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, the beads</p>
<p>Could be made of gold, silver,</p>
<p>Rubies, crystal,</p>
<p>Conch, musāragalva coral, or pearl. {12.32}</p>
<p>“One can make different types of rosaries,</p>
<p>Using coral or other precious substances,</p>
<p>To create a divine rosary,</p>
<p>Beautiful and auspicious. {12.33}</p>
<p>“With a focused mind, one should string onto the thread</p>
<p>Round beads made of earth,</p>
<p>Or any other beads that are more or less round,</p>
<p>Be they seeds or mineral in origin. {12.34}</p>
<p>“Reciting the mantra with earnestness,</p>
<p>One should string the beads using a sharp-pointed blade of grass,</p>
<p>Either one hundred and eight of them, or twenty-five,</p>
<p>Or the medium number of fifty. {12.35}</p>
<p>“A rosary of this size should be strung</p>
<p>By a well-focused mantra practitioner.</p>
<p>The supreme kind of rosary</p>
<p>Would consist of one thousand and eight beads. {12.36}</p>
<p>“It is always a rosary of one of these four types</p>
<p>That may be strung by the practitioners of mantra.</p>
<p>When subsequently tying the knot,</p>
<p>One should do it thrice, or at least twice.{12.37}</p>
<p>“To keep the rosary tight (mālāsamāsataḥ),</p>
<p>One should fasten [the knot]</p>
<p>With rings made of flower-metal, gold,</p>
<p>Silver, or copper. {12.38}</p>
<p>“Finally, one should make a plaiting loop,</p>
<p>Adding them in succession to form a plait.</p>
<p>One should wrap the plait firmly and with care,</p>
<p>So that it stays tight. {12.39}</p>
<p>“One should fashion it well</p>
<p>To make it resemble a maṇḍala</p>
<p>With the shape of a snake’s hood</p>
<p>Adorned by the wrapping. {12.40}</p>
<p>“The rosary may have the form of a string of pearls,</p>
<p>Fashioned as a neck ornament.</p>
<p>One should wash it in pure water,</p>
<p>Such as that of a clean river. {12.41}</p>
<p>“Having washed it as described before,</p>
<p>One should take it out of the water</p>
<p>And perform the ablutions thoroughly oneself ,</p>
<p>Holding it as one does a string of beads. {12.42}</p>
<p>“One should wipe it with the five products of the cow</p>
<p>And, likewise, with powdered clay.</p>
<p>One should then rinse it with clean water</p>
<p>And smear it with fragrant unguents, {12.43}</p>
<p>“Including those of auspicious colors,</p>
<p>Such as white sandalwood and saffron.</p>
<p>Having thus anointed it with care,</p>
<p>One should go to one’s hut.{12.44}</p>
<p>“One should walk up to the place</p>
<p>Where the painting of the medium type is,</p>
<p>With the supreme among the victorious ones, the chief sage,</p>
<p>The best of men, the Lion of the Śākyas, painted in its center. {12.45}</p>
<p>“One should always place the rosary</p>
<p>Before the image of the Teacher that contains relics</p>
<p>Of the victorious upon the earth;</p>
<p>It should be placed close by. {12.46}</p>
<p>“One should thus place the rosary on the canvas</p>
<p>Before and near to the image of Śākyamuni</p>
<p>And incant it 1000 times 108,</p>
<p>Plus an additional 108 times. {12.47}</p>
<p>“Having fasted the whole day and night,</p>
<p>One should offer the rosary to the best of sages.</p>
<p>One can also do the recitation as before,</p>
<p>Identical in terms of numbers.{12.48}</p>
<p>“Then, having incanted the rosary,</p>
<p>One should leave it there for the night.</p>
<p>A knower of mantras should sleep in the same place,</p>
<p>On a bed of kuśa grass spread on the ground. {12.49}</p>
<p>“Should he behold in his sleep</p>
<p>Beautiful dream images,</p>
<p>They indicate the results</p>
<p>In which he will obtain accomplishment. {12.50}</p>
<p>“If a practitioner of mantra should see in his dream</p>
<p>Buddhas, śrāvakas, or pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>His ritual actions will definitely succeed,</p>
<p>Bearing results for him. {12.51}</p>
<p>“If he beholds in his sleep</p>
<p>A wonderful, beautiful-looking boy</p>
<p>In the form of the divine youth,</p>
<p>He should offer the rosary to him.</p>
<p>His mantras will succeed without fail,</p>
<p>Accomplishing all his aims.” {12.52}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed twelfth chapter in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This chapter belongs to the detailed section on the procedure of the “medium” painting, and also constitutes the detailed chapter on the procedure of the rosary.</p>
<p>Chapter 13</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni again looked at the realm of the Pure Abode, and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, O Mañjuśrī, a ritual sequence for a special worship of [the god of] fire, which is meant for those practitioners of vidyā who engage in the rite of homa according to the special procedure that has been succinctly explained in the chapter on mantras in your manual. Once established in this routine, beings become actively engage in the conduct of all vidyās. What is this sequence? The mantric words of the secret vidyā spell are as follows: {13.1}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, rise up, O tawny [flame] with red eyes! Give and cause to give! Hūṁ, phaṭ phaṭ! Destroy all the obstacles, svāhā!</p>
<p>“This, O Mañjuśrī, is the supreme heart [mantra] of [the god of] fire that accomplishes all activities and fulfills all wishes. {13.2}</p>
<p>“At the beginning, the practitioner should offer into the fire three oblations of ghee, incanted each time with this heart mantra of fire. For someone engaged in this way in the performance of the pacifying, nourishing, or wrathful activities, there are prescribed three types of firewood, respectively. {13.3}</p>
<p>“The sticks from the aśoka tree are for the activity of pacifying,</p>
<p>Especially if they are moist with sap.</p>
<p>The best ones are nine inches, a cubit,</p>
<p>Or perhaps three fingers long. {13.4}</p>
<p>“The ritual instructions specify</p>
<p>That viscid sticks are the best.</p>
<p>They should be without holes nor be hollow,</p>
<p>With the hue of a parrot’s plumage. {13.5}</p>
<p>“One should avoid yellow,</p>
<p>White, or black colors.</p>
<p>One should collect sticks without holes,</p>
<p>Rejecting also those damaged by worms. {13.6}</p>
<p>“Sticks of other colors are not recommended.</p>
<p>One should avoid only sticks of the worst kind.</p>
<p>They should be not too dry and not too moist.</p>
<p>Nor should one use scorched sticks. {13.7}</p>
<p>“One should also avoid those that are</p>
<p>Rotten, crooked, or too long.</p>
<p>One should then prepare a fire pit,</p>
<p>Rectangular on all sides. {13.8}</p>
<p>“One should carefully dig a pit</p>
<p>To the depth of four cubits,</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, three cubits, two cubits,</p>
<p>Or even one cubit. {13.9}</p>
<p>“The pit should be free of living organisms</p>
<p>And made of sand.</p>
<p>One should then prepare a lotus-shaped altar</p>
<p>Encircling the pit all around. {13.10}</p>
<p>“Or, one can carefully make</p>
<p>An enclosure in the shape of a square,</p>
<p>With corners in the shape of vajras,</p>
<p>Both ends of which are three-pronged.{13.11}</p>
<p>“Inside this fire pit one should prepare</p>
<p>A flat, two-cubit area.</p>
<p>One who is well prepared should perform the homa</p>
<p>In a pure, cleanly swept place, {13.12}</p>
<p>“On a well-chosen riverbank,</p>
<p>Or in a lonely spot on dry land,</p>
<p>A charnel ground, an empty dwelling,</p>
<p>Or on a mountaintop. {13.13}</p>
<p>“Also, one can always do this in an empty temple</p>
<p>Or a big forest.</p>
<p>Places that have been recommended by the most eminent of men</p>
<p>As suitable for successful practice {13.14}</p>
<p>“Have also been described as suitable in every respect</p>
<p>For the performance of the homa rite.</p>
<p>One who knows the mantra,</p>
<p>Having sat on a bundle of kuśa grass {13.15}</p>
<p>“One cubit in size,</p>
<p>Should perform the homa rite in a particular way.</p>
<p>If one remains in such places,</p>
<p>Accomplishment will be swift, have no doubt. {13.16}</p>
<p>“For the activities of pacifying and enriching</p>
<p>One should sit facing east or north.</p>
<p>Violent activities, however, associated with the south,</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner should avoid. {13.17}</p>
<p>“When one faces east, the accomplishment will be of a peaceful kind;</p>
<p>When it is the north, it will be of an enriching kind.</p>
<p>One should always begin the mantra recitation</p>
<p>Facing these directions. {13.18}</p>
<p>“One should perform rites of enriching</p>
<p>Using sticks of the bilva, mango, waved-leaf fig, or banyan tree.</p>
<p>Sticks used for violent rites</p>
<p>Should be dry, pungent, sour, or bitter.{13.19}</p>
<p>“All these that are meant for violent rites should be avoided,</p>
<p>As they have been prohibited by the sages.</p>
<p>In the rites of pacifying and enriching</p>
<p>Sticks moist with sap are said to be the best. {13.20}</p>
<p>“Dry sticks, used in violent rites,</p>
<p>Should be avoided, according to the sages;</p>
<p>They can, however, be used</p>
<p>If the right type is not available.{13.21}</p>
<p>“Around the fire pit one should spread</p>
<p>An array of kuśa grass blades that are pointed at both ends,</p>
<p>Using blades that have a glossy, yellow-green color,</p>
<p>Like a peacock’s neck. {13.22}</p>
<p>“One should always use blades of this kind</p>
<p>In rites of pacifying and enriching,</p>
<p>And dried blades of other grasses</p>
<p>Of an emerald color {13.23}</p>
<p>“In rites of evil activity;</p>
<p>As for these, though, they are forbidden by the best of victors.</p>
<p>One should take pure and clean water,</p>
<p>Which always must be free of worms, {13.24}</p>
<p>“And circumambulate the fire pit clockwise,</p>
<p>Sprinkling it all around.</p>
<p>One should then light the fire, wholly absorbed in this task,</p>
<p>Having performed the ablutions according to procedure. {13.25}</p>
<p>“With clean roots of grass,</p>
<p>One should prepare a torch of the right size,</p>
<p>Then take it in hand</p>
<p>And carefully kindle the fire. {13.26}</p>
<p>“One should not blow at the kindling with one’s mouth,</p>
<p>Nor fan the fire with the edge of one’s garment,</p>
<p>Such as the undergarment or the upper garment,</p>
<p>But there is no restriction on other clothes. {13.27}</p>
<p>“Nor should one fan the fire with one’s hand,</p>
<p>Or risk putting it out by being overzealous.</p>
<p>One should fan it with a pure frond of a palm,</p>
<p>Or perhaps a clean cloth or leaf. {13.28}</p>
<p>“When the fire has been kindled,</p>
<p>Fanned with the wind generated as described,</p>
<p>The knower of mantra should let it blaze</p>
<p>And be well focused on the homa. {13.29}</p>
<p>“One should then sprinkle it three times,</p>
<p>Using one’s left hand.</p>
<p>Then one should offer three oblations,</p>
<p>Using for this purpose clarified cow’s butter. {13.30}</p>
<p>“One should then bow to</p>
<p>All the buddhas, the protectors,</p>
<p>And salute also, as seems fit,</p>
<p>The mantra lord of one’s personal mantra. {13.31}</p>
<p>“Then, wholly dedicated to the task,</p>
<p>One should invite the god of fire using fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>Always incanted seven times</p>
<p>With the heart mantra of fire.{13.32}</p>
<p>“A wise practitioner, a knower of the mantra,</p>
<p>Should summon him and offer him a place.</p>
<p>One should offer him a seat</p>
<p>With the same heart mantra and no other. {13.33}</p>
<p>“In order to worship the god of fire</p>
<p>One should offer three oblations of firewood sticks</p>
<p>Covered in curds with ghee and smeared with honey,</p>
<p>Performing the rite complete with the mantra.{13.34}</p>
<p>“One should, at that time,</p>
<p>Smear both ends of the sticks with these substances,</p>
<p>Applying ghee and honey,</p>
<p>And mixing it with curds.{13.35}</p>
<p>“One can perform this 1000,</p>
<p>100,000, or 108 times.</p>
<p>If one is a practitioner of a secret mantra,</p>
<p>One should pronounce it once for each oblation cast into the fire. {13.36}</p>
<p>“When performing peaceful rites,</p>
<p>The fire should form a circle,</p>
<p>Or a single tongue of flame.</p>
<p>For the rites of enrichment, it should be smokeless.{13.37}</p>
<p>“The fire should be smoky for rites of the violent type,</p>
<p>Described by the victorious ones as forbidden.</p>
<p>If the fire has a color,</p>
<p>Its color is associated with a respective oblatory activity. {13.38}</p>
<p>“If this activity is peaceful, a fire that is white in color</p>
<p>Has always been praised by the victorious ones as the best.</p>
<p>If one offers into a white fire,</p>
<p>The [peaceful] mantras will be successful. {13.39}</p>
<p>“The color red will always guarantee</p>
<p>Accomplishment in the rites of enrichment.</p>
<p>If the fire is black and the smoke is brown,</p>
<p>Violent rites will be successful. {13.40}</p>
<p>“There are thus three types of accomplishment</p>
<p>Associated with the three colors.</p>
<p>The fire may also have another color, such as the color of a cloud,</p>
<p>And may appear in different forms. {13.41}</p>
<p>“When the fire is like this,</p>
<p>The mantras cannot possibly succeed.</p>
<p>When seeing the fire blazing</p>
<p>With this color {13.42}</p>
<p>“Or with various [other undesirable] colors and forms,</p>
<p>One should begin the rite once again.</p>
<p>If one desires the mantra to succeed,</p>
<p>One must perform the recitation again,{13.43}</p>
<p>“And do the homa rite once again</p>
<p>Following the established ritual procedure.</p>
<p>To invoke or dismiss the deity,</p>
<p>One should pronounce the mantra of fire {13.44}</p>
<p>“Within the circle prepared beforehand,</p>
<p>Following the right procedure.</p>
<p>Employing this mantra, one should perform the homa</p>
<p>Complete with the rites of invoking and dismissing the deity. {13.45}</p>
<p>“Based on this particular rite,</p>
<p>One can accomplish any rite.</p>
<p>One should commence such fire observances</p>
<p>In front of the painting. {13.46}</p>
<p>“One’s mantras will then be successful,</p>
<p>As formerly declared by the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>One should not perform just any activities, however,</p>
<p>But only those praised by the victorious ones. {13.47}</p>
<p>“Thus, one should not perform other activities,</p>
<p>Especially the evil ones</p>
<p>Censured by the victorious ones</p>
<p>And forbidden and reviled by the world.{13.48}</p>
<p>“One will become either a universal emperor,</p>
<p>Or a bodhisattva protecting the earth.</p>
<p>One will attain the five superknowledges,</p>
<p>Or the state of a god. {13.49}</p>
<p>“One who always applies the appropriate knowledge of the painting</p>
<p>And is confident about the rite of the homa</p>
<p>Will become the master of subterranean paradises</p>
<p>And also be able to travel in the sky. {13.50}</p>
<p>“One will be able to change into an earth god or a yakṣa</p>
<p>Who always attracts yakṣa maidens.</p>
<p>One may become the ruler of a kingdom,</p>
<p>Or a district, or perhaps the head of a village. {13.51}</p>
<p>“One may at will become a vidyādhara or an asura</p>
<p>With the power to enthrall all beings.</p>
<p>One will be able to summon the spirits,</p>
<p>As well as the great and noble beings. {13.52}</p>
<p>“By means of this rite of homa,</p>
<p>One will be able to summon the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>The great beings who abide on any of the ten levels,</p>
<p>Not to mention ordinary humans on this earth. {13.53}</p>
<p>“One may become a general of an army,</p>
<p>Or someone of exceptionally great might in this world.</p>
<p>One may control all the spirits</p>
<p>And, likewise, become a lord of men. {13.54}</p>
<p>“Whether it is for the sake of enthralling all beings,</p>
<p>Or becoming the king of men on earth,</p>
<p>One should always include, with every activity,</p>
<p>A complete rite of homa. {13.55}</p>
<p>“One should practice all the activities</p>
<p>With complete dedication and in full;</p>
<p>The supreme activity will then be successful</p>
<p>And will serve the highest purpose. {13.56}</p>
<p>“So too will the activities of the medium</p>
<p>And the lowest type be successful,</p>
<p>And one will also obtain all the relevant power substances.</p>
<p>Again, as has been said, the accomplishment can be of three types. {13.57}</p>
<p>“When the rite of homa is performed,</p>
<p>One’s accomplishment will be rich in results.</p>
<p>One should form the five-crested mudrā</p>
<p>And say the mantra of Keśinī. {13.58}</p>
<p>“One should perform all activities,</p>
<p>Having first performed the rite of self-protection.</p>
<p>When engaging in the rite of homa,</p>
<p>One should recite the following mantra.</p>
<p>This mantra should always be repeated,</p>
<p>In this rite, seven or eight times. {13.59}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, the perfect teachers. The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, burn! Remain, hūṁ! Ru ru, you from whom all things arise! You who are the origin, svāhā!{13.60}</p>
<p>“Using this mantra method,</p>
<p>One should thoroughly recite again and again.</p>
<p>A mantra adept, having thus recited twice or seven times,</p>
<p>Should offer oblations into the fire. {13.61}</p>
<p>“Using water incanted with this mantra,</p>
<p>One should sprinkle</p>
<p>Flowers, incense, perfume,</p>
<p>And everything all around. {13.62}</p>
<p>“One should then commence all activities</p>
<p>According to procedure.</p>
<p>In all one’s activities one should apply</p>
<p>The previously described method. {13.63}</p>
<p>“Having formed the great mudrā—</p>
<p>The famed five-crested—</p>
<p>One should do the protection rite</p>
<p>And then continually recite the mantra of Keśinī.{13.64}</p>
<p>“One should embark on all activities</p>
<p>Confident about the causes of accomplishment.</p>
<p>If favorable signs are seen</p>
<p>And beautiful sounds continuously heard, {13.65}</p>
<p>“One’s mantras will certainly produce results</p>
<p>By fulfilling the wished-for boons.</p>
<p>When first applying the activities</p>
<p>And engaging with mantra—the cause— {13.66}</p>
<p>“The accomplishment of such activities</p>
<p>Will be complete and rich in results.</p>
<p>The cries of ‘Victory!’ will be heard,</p>
<p>Along with the sounds of large and small kettledrums. {13.67}</p>
<p>“Accomplishment is always said to follow,</p>
<p>If one relies on the rite of homa.</p>
<p>Other favorable signs may also be seen</p>
<p>Or the beautiful sounds of birds heard. {13.68}</p>
<p>“Various kinds of sounds may be heard,</p>
<p>Whose meanings have been described by the victorious ones—</p>
<p>Many kinds of exquisite sounds,</p>
<p>Divine, auspicious, and pleasing to the mind. {13.69}</p>
<p>“Parasols, banners, and flags may be seen,</p>
<p>Along with women bedecked in jewelry,</p>
<p>And likewise vases full of offerings—</p>
<p>Seeing them is a sign of accomplishment. {13.70}</p>
<p>“They are all of many forms and colors,</p>
<p>Praised and venerated by the world.</p>
<p>When they are perceived,</p>
<p>The mantras, with their different applications, will be successful. {13.71}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed thirteenth chapter in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 14</p>
<p>Then Lord Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, O Mañjuśrī, a secret vidyā mantra of yours that accomplishes all mantras. It was granted by the tathāgatas, arose from the treasury of their teachings, belongs to the ‘Cloud of Dharma,’ and is of the essence of the sky. This vidyā is the supreme lord of all mundane and supramundane mantras, just like the divine youth is the lord of all beings. This lord is described as a tathāgata, the supreme and the most excellent. Just as Lord Buddha, O divine youth, is the most eminent person among gods and men, so he—this supreme vidyārāja—is among all the mantras. He has been formerly taught by the blessed buddhas who are equal in number to the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā and whose merits are ineffable. He has been regarded by them as the supremely secret heart mantra  of the tathāgata Ratnaketu, auspicious in every respect. He is praised and extolled by all the buddhas, is the relief of all beings, and is the destroyer of every evil. He grants every wish and fulfills every hope. So what is this mantra?”{14.1}</p>
<p>While he spoke, a ray of light called arouser of all the buddhas emerged from the tuft of hair between the eyebrows of the blessed Śākyamuni. It illuminated all the buddhafields in the ten directions, above, below, and everywhere, delighting the minds of all beings. It then disappeared into Blessed Śākyamuni’s uṣṇīṣa. Subsequently, there emerged from the same uṣṇīṣa the lord of vidyās named One Syllable, as a form ablaze all around with the light that all ordinary beings find impossible to look at, or to lay hold of. Out of this great effulgence emerged his body, consisting of a halo of light, displaying multiple aspects and the great form of a cakravartin. {14.2}</p>
<p>Having emerged, he illuminated the entire sky. He had a retinue of all the vidyā kings and was attended on and worshiped by many hundreds of thousands of millions of vidyās. He was praised by all the supramundane cakravartins and vidyārājas, eulogized by all the mantras, and cherished by all the buddhas and the bodhisattva great beings who had attained the tenth level of realization. Together they filled the entire canopy of the sky. His body was adorned with celestial gems and bedecked with great jewels and gems, beautiful in appearance, supremely radiant, emanating hundreds of thousands of millions of magical creations in various forms, pronouncing the one-syllable word of his mantra, and radiating a great mass of light. He positioned himself in midair above Lord Śākyamuni, facing and looking upon the entire realm of the Pure Abode and illuminating the circle of the great assembly. {14.3}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then pronounced the One Syllable, this vidyā cakravartin, the heart essence of all the tathāgatas, the supreme secret heart essence of the tathāgata called Ratnaketu; the One Syllable that is taught and cherished by all the tathāgatas intimately connected with Lord Ratnaketu—Śālendra­rāja,  Amitābha, Duḥprasaha, Sunetra, Suketu, Puṣpendra, and the sage Supināntaloka—and also by the [three] tathāgatas starting with Kanaka; the One Syllable that is taught and celebrated by all the perfectly awakened ones who have gone beyond. What is this One Syllable? {14.4} It is bhrūṁ.</p>
<p>“This, Mañjuśrī, is the supreme essence of all the tathāgatas. This is the great means of purification, One Syllable by name, the vidyādhara-cakravartin. When used along with him, all mantras will be successful. He is, O divine youth, recommended as the secret, supreme mantra that accords with all the mantras in your excellent king of manuals. He is the purifier of obscurations in all rites. A practitioner must first utter this mantra three hundred thousand times, and then, O divine youth, the rites for all the mantras and all the worldly and transcendent mantra methods in your king of manuals will be accomplished. When protected by One Syllable, one becomes invulnerable to attacks by any being. One will also not succumb to any obstacles, whether mundane or supramundane.” {14.5}</p>
<p>As soon as the One Syllable was pronounced by Lord Śākyamuni, all the world spheres of the great trichiliocosm shook in six different ways. All the buddhafields became filled with light and all the blessed buddhas dwelling there joined the circle of the great assembly gathered in the realm of the Pure Abode. So, too, all the bodhisattvas on the tenth level of realization who were irreversibly established in perfect awakening, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas, all the beings possessed of great powers, roused by the light from One Syllable, the vidyārāja, arrived enthralled in the assembly.  And other beings living in infinite worldly realms who followed the painful destinies of hell, the hungry ghosts, and animals, were touched by the radiance of the great light. When thus illuminated, those who were acutely suffering, immersed in their painful experience, became cheered in their minds. They entered definitively into the three vehicles. {14.6}</p>
<p>Then Lord Śākyamuni looked again at this great circle of the assembly and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, as I tell about this vidyārāja! He possesses great magical power. As a maṇḍala deity, he is depicted without a retinue. He is suitable for all types of activity. He is the supreme monarch of all vidyās and fulfills the hopes of all beings. For all the profusion of rites, he is present in the large body of rites of the mantra system associated with you. He accomplishes all mantras and is universally applicable. He is renowned as a great lord who is very energetic and is particularly skilled in the method and wisdom that benefit beings who practice. He clears up the entire path to awakening and establishes beings in nirvāṇa. He causes one to ascend to the seat of awakening, and he [facilitates] the accumulation of virtue. {14.7}</p>
<p>“It is his extensive ritual that I will now briefly teach, including the procedure of making his painting and his maṇḍala and how it is the means of accomplishment, and also how to practice the previously mentioned mantra conduct, established in which sentient beings will succeed in the practice of this great cakravartin, the marvelous vidyārāja, the supreme lord of all mantras, the illuminator, the fulfiller of all wishes, the guide, the benefactor of the whole world, who, like the Buddha, appears directly, is self-arisen, and may be employed in all activities—the highest, the medium, and the minor. {14.8}</p>
<p>“He is blissful, auspicious,</p>
<p>Tranquil, and destroys all evil.</p>
<p>He is the god of the gods</p>
<p>And the most eminent among sages. {14.9}</p>
<p>“He is a buddha, a sun, and a kinsman,</p>
<p>Completely pure and renowned in the world.</p>
<p>He knows the nature of all dharmas,</p>
<p>Belongs to the peak of existence, and is not sullied. {14.10}</p>
<p>“I will now teach his best ritual,</p>
<p>So please listen, if you desire prosperity.</p>
<p>To start, one should prepare a high-quality canvas,</p>
<p>Free of hair or any adhering dirt, {14.11}</p>
<p>“New, especially white, and with a fringe.</p>
<p>On it, one should paint as described below.</p>
<p>The canvas should be two cubits in height</p>
<p>And one cubit across. {14.12}</p>
<p>“It should be as described—bright,</p>
<p>Spotless, pleasant in appearance,</p>
<p>Of pure white color,</p>
<p>Well washed, and free of rough patches.{14.13}</p>
<p>“One can use a white and dust-free</p>
<p>Cloth of dukūla bark,</p>
<p>Flaxen cloth, or cloth of any bark,</p>
<p>Pure and free of fibers. {14.14}</p>
<p>“It should not be produced by worms,</p>
<p>Or received from people as a gift.</p>
<p>Thus it should not be silken,</p>
<p>But any other kind described as suitable.{14.15}</p>
<p>“On such a superior cloth</p>
<p>One should draw the palace.</p>
<p>One should draw the likeness of the Teacher</p>
<p>Garlanded by a circle of light. {14.16}</p>
<p>“He should be painted a golden color,</p>
<p>Haloed by light, sage-like,</p>
<p>Alone, sheltered inside a cave</p>
<p>On a mountain, in all his splendor.{14.17}</p>
<p>“One should draw a silken canopy</p>
<p>Strung with garlands of jewels.</p>
<p>Behind it are two gods</p>
<p>Who are supporting it. {14.18}</p>
<p>“Above the mountain</p>
<p>One should draw a jewel garland</p>
<p>And, around the canopy,</p>
<p>Decorations made of strings of pearls. {14.19}</p>
<p>“Having carefully painted all this</p>
<p>Above the king of mountains,</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain</p>
<p>One should draw the waters of the great ocean. {14.20}</p>
<p>“Around the edges of the canvas,</p>
<p>One should draw flowers, such as</p>
<p>The blossoms of the ironwood tree, pannay tree,</p>
<p>Bulletwood tree, juhi jasmine, {14.21}</p>
<p>“Royal jasmine, and beautyberry.</p>
<p>Always include red amaranth,</p>
<p>Fragrant blue lotuses,</p>
<p>And, further, white lotuses. {14.22}</p>
<p>“One should draw these different varieties</p>
<p>And other fragrant species of flowers.</p>
<p>One should always draw</p>
<p>Only flowers of the species as described.{14.23}</p>
<p>“One should make offerings pleasing to the Teacher</p>
<p>In order to worship him.</p>
<p>Following the previously described procedure</p>
<p>In regard to the superior painting, or the others, {14.24}</p>
<p>“And having ensured that the skein, the weaver,</p>
<p>And the painter are as desired,</p>
<p>One should do the painting during the prātihāra fortnight,</p>
<p>On an especially auspicious day. {14.25}</p>
<p>“When such a time has arrived</p>
<p>One should do the prescribed mantra recitation.</p>
<p>One should execute everything, in every detail,</p>
<p>Just as previously explained. {14.26}</p>
<p>“One should paint the complete figure of the Teacher</p>
<p>Using paints of bright and vivid colors.</p>
<p>He should be fully endowed with his many aspects,</p>
<p>Equal in splendor to the karnikara flower. {14.27}</p>
<p>“One should paint this sage, born into the Jewel family,</p>
<p>In golden color,</p>
<p>With the same hue as the champak flowers</p>
<p>And possessing all the features as described. {14.28}</p>
<p>“He is the highly illustriousRatnaketu,</p>
<p>The most eminent and best of sages.</p>
<p>One should paint this jewel among buddhas</p>
<p>Who has control over all phenomena. {14.29}</p>
<p>“He sits on a jewel mountain,</p>
<p>Adorned with jewel caves,</p>
<p>In a cross-legged posture,</p>
<p>Delivering a Dharma discourse. {14.30}</p>
<p>“With a gentle smile on his face,</p>
<p>This hero’s mind is steeped in concentration.</p>
<p>One should also paint whatever is</p>
<p>On the outside of his cave, below, and around it. {14.31}</p>
<p>“In the corner at the end of the canvas one should paint</p>
<p>The practitioner, kneeling down.</p>
<p>In his extended hand he holds incense,</p>
<p>And his body is slightly bent forward. {14.32}</p>
<p>“One should paint him as wearing an upper garment</p>
<p>And other clothes just as in real life,</p>
<p>Above the great ocean that is</p>
<p>To the lower right of the Blessed One. {14.33}</p>
<p>“One should draw him—the practitioner of mantra who aspires for perfection—</p>
<p>Wholly applying oneself to the task.</p>
<p>This is the procedure of doing the painting,</p>
<p>As has been taught by those venerated by the world;</p>
<p>Now will be taught</p>
<p>The maṇḍala of the deity.{14.34}</p>
<p>“The mantra practitioner should really understand</p>
<p>The mantra at the time of employing it</p>
<p>And always use it to do the preliminary practice,</p>
<p>Training thus for success in recitation.{14.35}</p>
<p>“For this reason he should be initiated into the mantra</p>
<p>From this manual, so beautifully taught—</p>
<p>The mantra that is associated with the maṇḍala conduct</p>
<p>And always requires initiation.{14.36}</p>
<p>“He should have confidence in the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Be initiated into all its mantras,</p>
<p>Always apply himself to the tantra,</p>
<p>And be able to perform the rite of self-protection.{14.37}</p>
<p>“The master, possessed of great splendor, should also protect</p>
<p>His assistants with demon-slaying [mantras] and examine them carefully.</p>
<p>He should be well established as a spiritual master</p>
<p>And keep his observances. {14.38}</p>
<p>“He should have profound insight, be always gentle,</p>
<p>Noble, and compassionate,</p>
<p>And look for the same characteristics</p>
<p>In all his assistants. {14.39}</p>
<p>“One should accept as disciples those who are well qualified—</p>
<p>One, two, or three,</p>
<p>Or perhaps eight or more of them—</p>
<p>But avoid [accepting too] many. {14.40}</p>
<p>“One should always follow, for this maṇḍala,</p>
<p>The procedure as previously explained.</p>
<p>Those possessing the ten powers declared</p>
<p>This to be the best of maṇḍalas.</p>
<p>One should therefore draw no other maṇḍala,</p>
<p>And follow no other rite but Mañjughoṣa’s.{14.41}</p>
<p>“I will now give the measurements</p>
<p>Of this very magnificent maṇḍala.</p>
<p>It should be four cubits, two cubits,</p>
<p>Or perhaps eight, or more, in diameter. {14.42}</p>
<p>“One should draw it in a clean place,</p>
<p>Especially a riverbank or a mountaintop.</p>
<p>One should use powders of five colors</p>
<p>And follow the previously taught procedure. {14.43}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala should have four corners, four doors,</p>
<p>And be adorned with four gateways.</p>
<p>Its four sides should be of equal length,</p>
<p>And its splendor should equal a divine enclosure. {14.44}</p>
<p>“The paints should be of bright, vivid colors,</p>
<p>Pure and beautiful,</p>
<p>With a nice fragrance and other aspects.</p>
<p>One should start painting it with the help of a companion, {14.45}</p>
<p>“While observing silence and one’s temporary vows,</p>
<p>As well as the eight [precepts].</p>
<p>One should be untroubled in mind, moderate in eating,</p>
<p>And virtuous; continually recite the mantra; {14.46}</p>
<p>“And refrain from evil activities,</p>
<p>Performing only those of pacifying and enriching.</p>
<p>One should start in the center</p>
<p>And draw the Teacher using paints.{14.47}</p>
<p>“First, one should paint Tathāgata Ratnaketu,</p>
<p>Complete with adornments of various jewels,</p>
<p>Sitting inside a cave,</p>
<p>And of great splendor.{14.48}</p>
<p>“He sits in a cross-legged posture</p>
<p>And turns the wheel of Dharma.</p>
<p>One should draw on the canvas</p>
<p>Everything that is normally offered to the Teacher.{14.49}</p>
<p>“It should be adorned with mudrā symbols</p>
<p>Arranged in three rows.</p>
<p>One should paint all that is offered,</p>
<p>Arranged in rows all around.{14.50}</p>
<p>“They should be densely packed together,</p>
<p>Arranged in order without mixing them up.</p>
<p>In their center should be painted</p>
<p>The wheel-turning lord of great power. {14.51}</p>
<p>“He has the color of the rising sun</p>
<p>And the radiant form of a divine youth.</p>
<p>One should paint him with care</p>
<p>As turning the great wheel. {14.52}</p>
<p>“He is in his form of a great king,</p>
<p>Invested with a crown and other adornments,</p>
<p>Wearing a diadem of a great being,</p>
<p>And adorned with every ornament.{14.53}</p>
<p>“He wears a fine silken sash around his waist</p>
<p>And brightly colored silk garments.</p>
<p>He is garlanded and adorned</p>
<p>With garlands and clothes with a gentle, soft glow. {14.54}</p>
<p>“He inhales the fragrance of a cluster of bulletwood blossoms,</p>
<p>Which he holds in his right hand.</p>
<p>He is a deity with a gentle smile on his face,</p>
<p>Of great valor and power. {14.55}</p>
<p>“He is of beautiful physique,</p>
<p>Neither too young nor too old.</p>
<p>In his left hand he always holds a wheel</p>
<p>Enveloped in a garland of light. {14.56}</p>
<p>“One should paint him sitting with one leg tucked in and the other extended,</p>
<p>His arms close to his torso.</p>
<p>He is radiant with a divine glow,</p>
<p>Well formed and beautiful.{14.57}</p>
<p>“He sits on a heap of jewels,</p>
<p>With his whole body emitting a great radiance.</p>
<p>He grants boons, always becoming active</p>
<p>In response to any propitious mantra. {14.58}</p>
<p>“Blazing like fire,</p>
<p>He is adorned with a halo of light</p>
<p>And surrounded by flames</p>
<p>Fanned by the wind. {14.59}</p>
<p>“If they apply the mantra,</p>
<p>People on the earth will blaze with light the same way.</p>
<p>A Dharma follower who visualizes</p>
<p>Such a great hero {14.60}</p>
<p>“Will cause all mantras to take effect</p>
<p>And will be freed from all his faults,</p>
<p>Even if he has committed the five acts of immediate retribution,</p>
<p>Is undisciplined or indolent. {14.61}</p>
<p>“All such negativity will be appeased,</p>
<p>And he will be liberated by seeing the Lord.</p>
<p>Merely by seeing the maṇḍala</p>
<p>Of the lord of deities, the wheel holder,</p>
<p>Other known types of negativity</p>
<p>Will depart too, at that very moment. {14.62}</p>
<p>“Next, one should purify the eastern door</p>
<p>With the mantra of the Lord.</p>
<p>The maṇḍala should be clearly visualized,</p>
<p>Surrounded by gateways,</p>
<p>Adorned with plantain trees,</p>
<p>And thoroughly elegant in form. {14.63}</p>
<p>“One should offer bali, always including</p>
<p>Incense, lamps, perfume, and beautiful garlands.</p>
<p>One should do everything respectfully,</p>
<p>Following the previously described procedure. {14.64}</p>
<p>“In front of the wheel-holding monarch,</p>
<p>In the center, one should place a full jar.</p>
<p>A mantra adept should not allow this jar,</p>
<p>Which is called ‘victory,’ to be moved. {14.65}</p>
<p>“One should then dig the fire pit,</p>
<p>Following the right procedure,</p>
<p>And commence the homa rite,</p>
<p>Employing none other than the mantra of the Lord. {14.66}</p>
<p>“One should offer into the fire of cutch tree sticks</p>
<p>One thousand and eight oblations</p>
<p>Consisting of sticks of the dhak, sandalwood,</p>
<p>Bilva, cluster fig, or sandan tree. {14.67}</p>
<p>“One can likewise offer devil’s horsewhip</p>
<p>In all types of activity, applying care.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can offer sesame seeds smeared with ghee</p>
<p>And mixed with burnt gandha.{14.68}</p>
<p>“In all types of activity,</p>
<p>One should always offer one thousand and eight oblations</p>
<p>At the three junctions of the day as previously described.</p>
<p>As taught by the sages,{14.69}</p>
<p>“One should bathe, put on clean clothes,</p>
<p>Eat the three ‘white foods,’ choose an auspicious nakṣatra,</p>
<p>And perform the previously described rituals,</p>
<p>Including recitation, homa, and others. {14.70}</p>
<p>“One should perform all of [the above]</p>
<p>Employing One Syllable, who is like</p>
<p>The [entire] family of Cakravartin employed as a mantra.</p>
<p>One should employ him in all rites.{14.71}</p>
<p>“This sole hero, always without maṇḍala companions,</p>
<p>Applies himself to his tasks with great power.</p>
<p>One should perform the rites for all mantras</p>
<p>Always reciting him during the performance. {14.72}</p>
<p>“Every rite will then be accomplished—</p>
<p>The rites for the mundane mantras, preferred by the world;</p>
<p>And for the supramundane, of great valor;</p>
<p>And for the vidyārājas possessed of intense ascetic ‘heat.’{14.73}</p>
<p>“All the mantras taught in this manual,</p>
<p>And other mantras, will be successful—</p>
<p>Those taught by the sages;</p>
<p>By their sons possessed of the ten powers; {14.74}</p>
<p>“By Śakra and other world protectors;</p>
<p>By Viṣṇu, Śiva, and Brahmā;</p>
<p>By Sun, Moon, or other [luminaries];</p>
<p>By the kings of yakṣas or the rākṣasas; {14.75}</p>
<p>“By mahoragas, or kinnaras,</p>
<p>Or by the best of terrestrial sages;</p>
<p>And by garuḍas, mātṛs,</p>
<p>Humans, or other beings. {14.76}</p>
<p>“All the mantras that have ever been taught</p>
<p>Will reach accomplishment here,</p>
<p>As One Syllable gathers in himself all mantras</p>
<p>And is the leader in all rites. {14.77}</p>
<p>“He is the leader in all rites</p>
<p>As he controls all mantras.</p>
<p>He is the enthraller of all beings,</p>
<p>And the full extent of the tantras and mantras.{14.78}</p>
<p>“This mantra, One Syllable, makes the rites</p>
<p>Of all mantra reciters bear fruit.</p>

<p>One can attract all deities. {14.79}</p>

<p>Both mundane and transcendent mantras.</p>
<p>Having completed the painting,</p>
<p>Entirely pleasant to look at, {14.81}</p>
<p>“One should place it in a clean location,</p>
<p>On a riverbank or the top of a mountain.</p>
<p>One should always do this facing west,</p>
<p>Following the previously described method. {14.82}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should then turn eastward and,</p>
<p>Following the correct procedure,</p>
<p>Sit of a bundle of darbha grass</p>
<p>And recite the mantra in an orderly way— {14.83}</p>
<p>“Not too loud and not too low,</p>
<p>Wholly focusing on bodhicitta.</p>
<p>If one does not hate any being,</p>
<p>One will attain accomplishment swiftly, in this life.{14.84}</p>
<p>“One should always cultivate the mind of loving kindness</p>
<p>Toward beings who are suffering and miserable;</p>
<p>Who are without a protector, forlorn,</p>
<p>Afflicted with pain, and weak; {14.85}</p>
<p>“And who are fallen into this terrible saṃsāra.</p>
<p>One who thus feels compassion will be successful.</p>
<p>One should always place, in front of the painting,</p>
<p>Many offerings, with great care, {14.86}</p>
<p>“Including a visualized, celestial woman</p>
<p>Emerging from one’s heart.</p>
<p>One should either visualize or physically present these offerings</p>
<p>To the completed painting of the victorious lord.{14.87}</p>
<p>“One should dig the fire pit at the same location,</p>
<p>Following the procedure according to the nature of the rite.</p>
<p>When the fire is fully ablaze,</p>
<p>The practitioner should offer the oblations: {14.88}</p>
<p>“White sandalwood and camphor</p>
<p>Should be offered in combination with saffron.</p>
<p>A mantra adept should offer</p>
<p>Into the burning fire one hundred and eight oblations. {14.89}</p>
<p>“One should always use the wood of</p>
<p>The cutch, waved-leaf fig, banyan, or dhak tree.</p>
<p>One should energetically light the fire</p>
<p>Using sticks from any of the trees just mentioned. {14.90}</p>
<p>“If sticks from these trees are unavailable,</p>
<p>One should procure other sticks,</p>
<p>Perhaps from a neem or a mango tree,</p>
<p>Or a thorn-apple bush. {14.91}</p>
<p>“The ones to be avoided, known to be used in evil rites,</p>
<p>Are sticks from any plant that has thorns.</p>

<p>One should perform the rites of pacifying and enriching;</p>

<p>Evil rites should not be performed. {14.92}</p>
<p>“These extensive ritual instructions</p>
<p>That include all the mantras and the rites</p>
<p>Will always lead to accomplishment</p>

<p>The mantra deities will then be summoned</p>
<p>And the boons will be granted. {14.93}</p>
<p>“The mantra practitioner who desires a kingdom on the earth</p>
<p>Should offer into the fire, in a complete homa rite,</p>
<p>The sticks of the waved-leaf fig, cluster fig,</p>
<p>Dhak, or banyan tree, {14.94}</p>
<p>“Smeared with ghee and curds,</p>
<p>With the addition of honey.</p>

<p>He should offer saffron and sandalwood. {14.95}</p>
<p>“If he desires lordship</p>
<p>Over vidyādhara gods,</p>
<p>He should offer 3,600,000 lotus flowers</p>
<p>With attached filaments. {14.96}</p>
<p>“At the end of the homa,</p>
<p>One should give a welcome offering to the Teacher.</p>
<p>A supreme painting will, at this moment, emit light,</p>
<p>Being, [in this way], marked by the victorious ones.{14.97}</p>
<p>“Upon merely touching it,</p>
<p>One will ascend to the realm of Brahmā,</p>
<p>Or as far as the realm of the Akaniṣṭha gods,</p>
<p>Or perhaps all the subterranean paradises. {14.98}</p>
<p>“When obtaining any of these accomplishments,</p>
<p>One will certainly become a king [in the respective realm].</p>
<p>Firm in one’s vows and valorous,</p>
<p>One will make the spirits flee. {14.99}</p>
<p>“In due order, one can always become,</p>
<p>Upon completing the rite, the king of vidyādharas.</p>

<p>Equal to an eon, {14.100}</p>
<p>“And when one dies, after all this time,</p>
<p>One will certainly progress toward awakening.</p>
<p>There is also another rite,</p>
<p>Whose details, in a condensed form, are as follows. {14.101}</p>
<p>“One should procure white lotus flowers</p>
<p>And combine them with white sandalwood.</p>
<p>If one offers them in ten million oblations,</p>
<p>One will be able to see Ratnaketu. {14.102}</p>
<p>“Upon seeing this supreme victor,</p>
<p>One will obtain the five superknowledges.</p>
<p>One will live for a long, great eon,</p>
<p>And will be a follower of the Buddha. {14.103}</p>
<p>“One will be able to see infinite buddhas,</p>
<p>Located throughout the quarters of the universe.</p>
<p>One should always worship them,</p>
<p>And will dwell together with them. {14.104}</p>
<p>“The realm called Ratnāvatī</p>
<p>Is the one where the Blessed One lives,</p>
<p>The supreme and most excellent sage,</p>
<p>The most eminent tathāgata Ratnaketu. {14.105}</p>
<p>“One will always dwell there,</p>
<p>Purified by the mantra; there is no doubt.</p>
<p>The following is another cherished rite,</p>
<p>Which has been taught by the most eminent of men. {14.106}</p>
<p>“A mantra practitioner should blend together</p>
<p>The blossoms of the ironwood tree,</p>
<p>Camphor, sandalwood, and saffron.</p>
<p>He should then offer them into the fire 7,800,000 times. {14.107}</p>
<p>“At the conclusion of the homa,</p>
<p>The deity will arrive along with his retinue.</p>
<p>Pleased, he will definitely grant a boon,</p>
<p>Touching the practitioner on the head. {14.108}</p>
<p>“As soon as the practitioner has been touched,</p>
<p>He will become the master of the seventh level of realization.</p>
<p>He will be called ‘bodhisattva,’</p>
<p>A true son of the victorious ones. {14.109}</p>
<p>“Always dedicated to awakening,</p>
<p>He will be prophesied to attain it,</p>
<p>And from then on, he, the son of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>Will know whatever is to be known. {14.110}</p>
<p>“He will know all the mantras,</p>
<p>And will happily follow his exalted destiny.</p>
<p>By merely seeing Ratnaketu</p>
<p>He will obtain the five superknowledges and become the king of mantras. {14.111}</p>
<p>“He will always be able to assume different forms</p>
<p>And different identities at any time.</p>
<p>He will always delight in the act of worshiping</p>
<p>Those who are endowed with all the best attributes. {14.112}</p>
<p>“In an instant, he will become eager</p>
<p>Only to perform activities of awakening.</p>

<p>In thousands of world spheres</p>
<p>And be able to see the good deeds</p>
<p>Of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. {14.114}</p>
<p>“He will hear their Dharma teachings</p>
<p>And will eagerly worship them.</p>
<p>There are also other rites</p>
<p>That originate from the victorious wheel turner.{14.115}</p>
<p>“One should offer one hundred thousand lamps</p>
<p>With wicks fed with pure ghee,</p>
<p>Set in golden or silver dishes,</p>
<p>Or perhaps copper or clay. {14.116}</p>
<p>“When these have been lit</p>

<p>On one hundred thousand floats,{14.117}</p>
<p>“And only men, without women,</p>
<p>Stand around with lamps in their hands,</p>
<p>They should make an offering to the Teacher in the painting</p>
<p>In an act of worship. {14.118}</p>
<p>“With all of them simultaneously engaged,</p>
<p>If each one recites the mantra</p>
<p>And makes offerings to the Teacher while reciting,</p>
<p>Accomplishment will manifest instantly.{14.119}</p>
<p>“All around the sound of thunder will be heard,</p>
<p>And the drumming of drums.</p>
<p>Many hosts of gods</p>
<p>Will exclaim, ‘Good!’ {14.120}</p>
<p>“The buddhas and bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Will appear in the sky and say,</p>

<p>You have made your ritual performance work! {14.121}</p>
<p>“ ‘You will not experience again</p>

<p>“There is yet another rite,</p>
<p>Which leads to the highest birth;</p>
<p>It has been taught by all the buddhas</p>
<p>And is known to confer great powers. {14.124}</p>
<p>“One should take a piece of neem tree wood</p>
<p>And make from it a vajra scepter</p>
<p>With three prongs at either end.</p>
<p>The middle part should represent the buddha of the Vajra family.{14.125}</p>
<p>“One should then purify the vajra with the mantra</p>
<p>And place it in front of the painting.</p>
<p>The practitioner should then recite the mantra,</p>
<p>Fully concentrated, while touching the vajra. {14.126}</p>
<p>“After completing 12,800,000 recitations</p>
<p>What is desired will be accomplished.</p>
<p>The vajra will then emit a single flame</p>
<p>And illuminate everything all around. {14.127}</p>
<p>“Then, by picking up the vajra,</p>
<p>One will thus ascend upward.</p>
<p>One will visit the world of Brahmā,</p>
<p>Or any other celestial realm equal to it.{14.128}</p>
<p>“One will travel through space</p>
<p>As the foremost of siddhas.</p>
<p>One will become the master</p>
<p>Of siddhas, vidyādharas, and so forth. {14.129}</p>
<p>“One will become a wheel-turning monarch</p>
<p>Reigning among a host of gods.</p>
<p>One will be able to assume different forms,</p>
<p>Based on the correct ascertainment of the nature of the body. {14.130}</p>
<p>“One will be able to remain in this condition</p>
<p>For ten intermediate eons, without deviating from it,</p>
<p>Always enjoying pleasures and venerated,</p>
<p>Always endowed with a beautiful form and qualities. {14.131}</p>
<p>“One will follow the conduct of bodhicitta,</p>
<p>Free from the sufferings of repeated birth.</p>
<p>One will become a celestial siddha,</p>
<p>Free from all negativity. {14.132}</p>
<p>“Passing on from there, one will be born a human</p>
<p>Destined for a life of many pleasures.</p>

<p>“If he is recited eight times,</p>
<p>One’s companions will be protected in all respects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a mantra practitioner</p>
<p>Should incant both his garments.{14.160}</p>
<p>“When both garments are incanted,</p>
<p>He will have removed all disease.</p>
<p>Touching these garments, after the mantra was recited,</p>
<p>Will destroy all bodily fever. {14.161}</p>
<p>“If mantra practitioners carefully incant</p>
<p>Their face or eyes, or both the face and the eyes,</p>
<p>They will destroy the anger of the angry</p>
<p>Merely by being looked at. {14.162}</p>
<p>“For any host of evil spirits,</p>

<p>“One should perform various rites,</p>
<p>Prepared the way one desires—</p>

<p>If it is big, the results will likewise be significant. {14.179}</p>
<p>“If it is medium, the result will be middling;</p>
<p>The success of the rite is always explained in this way.</p>
<p>One should therefore take special care to include</p>
<p>Homa in all ritual activities.” {14.180}</p>
<p>This concludes the chapter that provides the details of the practice of the cakravartin, including the painting procedure and the maṇḍala, fourteenth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 15</p>
<p>At that time, the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, the great being, was present in the midst of the same gathering. Seated, he rose from his seat, circumambulated the Blessed One clockwise three times, and, prostrating at the Blessed One’s feet, said this to him: {15.1}</p>
<p>“Good, O Blessed One! For the sake of those who follow the conduct entailing the ritual divisions of vidyā and homa rites performed at the junctions of the day, you have clearly explained and elucidated with supreme eloquence the path that consists of rites involving vidyā mantras; the path that manifested from the great Cloud of Dharma; the path that comprises the detailed ritual instructions pertaining to the cakravartin, the great vidyārāja who is the heart essence of all the tathāgatas; the path that brings results and fulfills all aims completely; the unsurpassable path that leads to awakening; the path marked with the cause that generates the conditions, actions, and their certain results; the path that is the root of virtue that causes the attainment of the ten miraculous powers, and whose ultimate goal is to ascend to the seat of awakening. That, Blessed One, is excellent! May the teacher please instruct us on the signs that accord with the accomplishment of mantra that appear in dreams, signs indicating the time when the beings who engage in the practice of all vidyā mantras should commence the activities that cause accomplishment, so that all vidyā mantras—the causes that fulfill the rites—bear results.” {15.2}</p>
<p>Thus addressed, Lord Śākyamuni said this to the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi:</p>
<p>“Good, O lord of yakṣas! You act for the benefit and happiness of many people. You act out of compassion for the world, in the interest of great numbers of people, for their benefit and happiness. You act in the interest of all the practitioners of vidyā mantras.  Listen well then, and carefully reflect upon what I will now tell you. {15.3}</p>
<p>“First, commencing the preparatory procedure as before, which is the same for all types of activity, one should go to a secluded place such as a mountaintop, a riverbank, a cave, or near a crossroad and build a hut at a clean spot. Following the same procedure as before for all types of activity, one should install the painting and worship it with sumptuous offerings. Then, during the bright fortnight or the prātihāra fortnight, always on an auspicious day, during the first watch of the night, one should prepare a mixture of white sandalwood, camphor, and saffron, and light a fire using sticks of the cutch tree. Sitting in front of the painting at a distance of four cubits, one should throw the oblation into the smokeless and flameless embers one thousand and eight times. Then, at the end of this offering, one should offer into the fire one thousand and eight lotus blossoms smeared with white sandalwood. At the end of the homa, one should form the mudrā of the auspicious seat and offer a seat to one’s mantra deity, using the same mantra. One should, however, perform the homa reciting the following mantra. {15.4}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is as follows:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you with the form of a divine youth! Show it, show! Reveal the truth to me in my dreams for the sake of my good fortune! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!{15.5}</p>
<p>“After performing the protection rite using this mantra, one should complete the required number of oblations in the homa rite as just described. Then, having spread around blades of kuśa grass that are pointed at both ends, one should go to sleep in front of the painting, not too far from it and not too near, with one’s head pointing east, using for a pillow a bundle of kuśa grass. During the first watch, while keeping oneself awake, one should salute all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, confess one’s wrongdoings, and offer oneself to all the buddhas. Then, one should surrender to the power of sleep as one likes. {15.6}</p>
<p>“Dreams that occur during the first watch</p>
<p>Are known to be generated by the humor of phlegm.</p>
<p>Those of the second watch, as they arise from bile,</p>
<p>Should be discounted as being of worldly origin. {15.7}</p>
<p>“One should know the dreams of the third watch to be generated by the humor of wind,</p>
<p>And those of the fourth, to originate from truth.</p>
<p>As for the phlegm-influenced dreams at the beginning of sleep,</p>
<p>One should always watch out for the following: {15.8}</p>
<p>“One may behold numerous jewel mountains,</p>
<p>Strings of pearls everywhere,</p>
<p>Or oneself bathed</p>
<p>In a mass of water, {15.9}</p>
<p>“Fully immersed in streams,</p>
<p>Or floating in a great ocean.</p>
<p>Wherever one perceives</p>
<p>One’s body to be,{15.10}</p>
<p>“One may see that place as dotted</p>
<p>With lotus ponds all around,</p>
<p>Floating gardens,</p>
<p>And tavern houses{15.11}</p>
<p>“Riding upon the waves</p>
<p>That surround them on all sides.</p>
<p>One may also see the Himalayas</p>
<p>Made of crystal and abounding in great rivers, {15.12}</p>
<p>“Trees, and the king of mountains</p>
<p>Fashioned from piled-up crystal</p>
<p>And shaded by a latticework of pearls</p>
<p>With masses of pearls. {15.13}</p>
<p>“Subjected to the influence of phlegm,</p>
<p>One may see a great rain with masses of water,</p>
<p>Or a bright white parasol</p>
<p>With white adornments, {15.14}</p>
<p>“Or perhaps a white elephant.</p>
<p>Such dreams are said to be influenced by phlegm.</p>
<p>One may see a white yak-tail whisk,</p>
<p>Or a man dressed in white. {15.15}</p>
<p>“If one touches sea salt, and so forth,</p>
<p>Or salt in general,</p>
<p>Or a strip of cotton or linen,</p>
<p>Or perhaps iron, silver, or aloewood, {15.16}</p>
<p>“Touching or ingesting them</p>
<p>Indicates that the dream is of the phlegm type.</p>
<p>If one eats roasted beans,</p>
<p>Sesame paste, sweet rice pudding, {15.17}</p>
<p>“Or different types of beans,</p>
<p>This, again, indicates that the dream is of the phlegm type.</p>
<p>Some say that eating svastikā cakes,</p>
<p>Or other food, such as rice-and-grain pudding with milk, {15.18}</p>
<p>“Brings on dreams</p>
<p>Of the phlegm type.</p>
<p>The same goes for śaṅkulya or parpaṭa cakes,</p>
<p>Or different types of soup. {15.19}</p>
<p>“Touching or eating them will cause</p>
<p>An increase of phlegm in one’s dreams.</p>
<p>It is agreed that there are many such types</p>
<p>Of hard and soft foods, in many forms.{15.20}</p>
<p>“If one eats or touches them,</p>
<p>The dreams will be induced by phlegm.</p>
<p>If one dreams of a seat, a bed, or a carriage for traveling</p>
<p>That is fashioned from a living being— {15.21}</p>
<p>“If one touches, mounts, or sees such</p>
<p>During the first watch of the night</p>
<p>As objects in one’s dream,</p>
<p>All such dreams are said to be influenced by phlegm. {15.22}</p>
<p>“Dreams of these types emerge from</p>
<p>And are effected by water,</p>
<p>And may be an indication of [having eaten]</p>
<p>Any of the various hard or soft foods that produce phlegm.{15.23}</p>
<p>“Seeing these objects in one’s dreams</p>
<p>Is due to the action of phlegm-producing foods.</p>
<p>The guides of the world have described</p>
<p>Many dreams that are hard even to conceive of.{15.24}</p>
<p>“For living beings, it is in the second watch</p>
<p>That dreams related to bile occur.</p>
<p>A person may see in a dream a blazing fire,</p>
<p>A light emanating from various jewels,{15.25}</p>
<p>“A conflagration, or meteors</p>
<p>Flashing in all directions.</p>
<p>Seeing these in a dream indicates that</p>
<p>One is debilitated by bile. {15.26}</p>
<p>“Likewise, should one see in one’s dream a ruby,</p>
<p>Or something else consisting of jewels,</p>
<p>One should know that these objects appear</p>
<p>To someone affected by bile. {15.27}</p>
<p>“Corresponding to the experience of the element fire,</p>
<p>If one touches or ingests</p>
<p>Different yellow articles in one’s dreams,</p>
<p>One is debilitated by bile. {15.28}</p>
<p>“One whose body is debilitated by bile</p>
<p>May see in one’s dream</p>
<p>A sun that burns uninterruptedly,</p>
<p>Continually spreading its intense heat. {15.29}</p>
<p>“One may also perceive, in one’s dream,</p>
<p>The sky as being of golden color</p>
<p>And the ground as yellow.</p>
<p>This is due to the debilitating influence of bile. {15.30}</p>
<p>“If one dreams, during the same watch,</p>
<p>Of a fire blazing all around</p>
<p>And illuminating the firmament of the sky,</p>
<p>One is flooded with the humor bile. {15.31}</p>
<p>“One may see the ground colored golden,</p>
<p>Or the mountains, piles of rocks,</p>
<p>A great elephant for riding,</p>
<p>Or everything made entirely of gold. {15.32}</p>
<p>“If one sees these persistently while asleep,</p>
<p>One is debilitated by the movement of bile.</p>
<p>If one dreams of a vessel made entirely of gold;</p>
<p>Or a golden carriage with similar adornments; {15.33}</p>
<p>“Or a seat, or perhaps a bed</p>
<p>Made entirely of gold—</p>
<p>If one touches or mounts them in one’s dream,</p>
<p>This indicates that the dream is of the bile type. {15.34}</p>
<p>“One may see oneself in a dream as wearing</p>
<p>Yellow garlands and clothes,</p>
<p>Covered in yellow unguents,</p>
<p>And provided with a yellow sacred cord; {15.35}</p>
<p>“One may also see in one’s dream</p>
<p>One’s own body as yellow.</p>
<p>This is due to the debilitating influence of bile,</p>
<p>Which manifests itself during the second watch. {15.36}</p>
<p>“These are the different categories</p>
<p>That dreams are grouped into based on color.</p>
<p>Thus, the dreams of the various appearances of yellow</p>
<p>Are caused by the humor bile. {15.37}</p>
<p>“The body’s being affected by bile</p>
<p>Manifests during the second watch.</p>
<p>A great variety of forms</p>
<p>Arising out of yellow light {15.38}</p>
<p>“Have been taught by the most eminent of men</p>
<p>To originate from bile.</p>
<p>As for the dreams that are of the wind type,</p>
<p>They are said to occur during the third watch of the night. {15.39}</p>
<p>“If one sees all the directions</p>
<p>Completely filled with light,</p>
<p>And perceives oneself as moving through space,</p>
<p>Traversing the firmament of the sky, {15.40}</p>
<p>“And continually wandering everywhere</p>
<p>Through space as far as the expanse of the sky,</p>
<p>Such a dream is said to be of the wind type,</p>
<p>As it brings this type of experience. {15.41}</p>
<p>“Swimming, jumping,</p>
<p>Climbing trees,</p>
<p>Reciting all treatises,</p>
<p>The mantras in particular, {15.42}</p>
<p>“And also teaching or speaking,</p>
<p>Are generally caused by wind.</p>
<p>Also, climbing thorny trees,</p>
<p>Or eating food that is very bitter, {15.43}</p>
<p>“Pungent, or sour—any such type of food—</p>
<p>Is caused by wind.</p>
<p>Tree fruits that are scattered by the wind</p>
<p>Produce masses of the humor of wind— {15.44}</p>
<p>“If they are eaten in a dream,</p>
<p>Such a dream is said to be generated by wind.</p>
<p>The element wind present in</p>
<p>Liquid and solid foods and substances{15.45}</p>
<p>“Agitates the minds of beings</p>
<p>When they touch or eat them.</p>
<p>If one sees oneself</p>
<p>As being a servant to all beings, {15.46}</p>
<p>“If this vision comes in a dream,</p>
<p>Such a person should be known to be of the wind type.</p>
<p>Different types of movements,</p>
<p>Different types of embracing and speaking, {15.47}</p>
<p>“Or different harsh expressions</p>
<p>Indicate that the dream is the wind type.</p>
<p>These and other types of dreams</p>
<p>Have been taught by the most eminent of men. {15.48}</p>
<p>“Three types of associations have been taught</p>
<p>Related to those who are of the attached, hateful, or deluded types:</p>
<p>Those with a proclivity to attachment generate phlegm,</p>
<p>Bile is the product of hatred, {15.49}</p>
<p>“While wind originates from delusion.</p>
<p>A mixture of the three generates a mixture of humors.</p>
<p>When attachment is stirred in sleep,</p>
<p>It will manifest as sexual dreams.{15.50}</p>
<p>“Thus, the desire for women will manifest</p>
<p>In dreams generated by phlegm.</p>
<p>Quarreling based on hatred</p>
<p>Will occur in dreams generated by bile. {15.51}</p>
<p>“Torpidity born from delusion</p>
<p>Manifests in dreams as the loss of memory.</p>
<p>In reality, though, dreams always manifest</p>
<p>Based on a mixture of the humors.{15.52}</p>
<p>“Thus, that which is designated as a dream</p>
<p>Is devoid, in all its [three] types, of pure essence.</p>
<p>Those who teach the truth taught the activities and lifespans</p>
<p>Particular to each of the [humor-based] category of beings.{15.53}</p>
<p>“Thus, beings described as being of the phlegm type</p>
<p>Have a nice complexion and are soft-spoken.</p>
<p>They live long lives, are intelligent,</p>
<p>Have oily skin, and are self-confident. {15.54}</p>
<p>“They are fair skinned, tall,</p>
<p>And always fond of intercourse with women.</p>
<p>They are virtuous, heroic at any time,</p>
<p>And always delight in showing respect.{15.55}</p>
<p>“When this is indicated by their birth horoscope,</p>
<p>They could be jealous and lack distinction.</p>
<p>Some may become kings</p>
<p>Fit to take command of an army. {15.56}</p>
<p>“Living according to their prescribed activity,</p>
<p>They will attain prosperity.</p>
<p>Their activities and their fruits are described as follows:</p>
<p>They do not neglect the activity [in favor of] the mantra,</p>
<p>As the mantra, according to what the guides of the world have said,</p>
<p>Is not the most important thing in terms of activity.{15.57}</p>
<p>“It is therefore said that in this world</p>
<p>Success belongs to those of the phlegm type.</p>
<p>They will attain dominion over the land,</p>
<p>Great prosperity, and magical powers.{15.58}</p>
<p>“A mantra reciter should not take</p>
<p>Any of the phlegm-producing foods in excess.</p>
<p>If one overindulges in these foods,</p>
<p>One’s dreams will become bereft of meaning. {15.59}</p>
<p>“A mantra practitioner should therefore not indulge in these foods,</p>
<p>As they are said not to be conducive to accomplishment.</p>
<p>A wise and clever person</p>
<p>Should not sleep at that time. {15.60}</p>
<p>“Now the characteristics of a person</p>
<p>Of the bile type will be described.</p>
<p>“He may be prone to hatred and anger,</p>
<p>Of black complexion, and physically weak.</p>
<p>He may be cruel and engage in cruel activities</p>
<p>And continually display a tendency toward deceit. {15.61}</p>
<p>“He may also be continually valiant and daring</p>
<p>And be endowed with strength and intelligence.</p>
<p>He is talkative, has many friends,</p>
<p>And has a deep understanding of many treatises. {15.62}</p>
<p>“Virtuous and firm in his actions,</p>
<p>He is also described as prone to hatred.</p>
<p>He is intelligent and possessed of great power,</p>
<p>But shows the signs of hatred. {15.63}</p>
<p>“He resents the valorous, is wealthy,</p>
<p>Understands human nature,</p>
<p>And is of pleasant appearance, free, detached,</p>
<p>Stable, and always tolerant of suffering. {15.64}</p>
<p>“Proud, greedy, and angry,</p>
<p>He is always fond of women.</p>
<p>Full of great energy and firm in applying the mantras,</p>
<p>He becomes very prosperous. {15.65}</p>
<p>“He engages beings by assaulting them,</p>
<p>As they submit to the way he acts.</p>
<p>His mantras—those that arrest the life force of beings—</p>
<p>Are always successful. {15.66}</p>
<p>“He swiftly accomplishes his violent aims</p>
<p>That have been rejected by the Sage.</p>
<p>The activities of such an individual—</p>
<p>Those that harm living beings—will succeed. {15.67}</p>
<p>“Rites of any mantra practitioner</p>
<p>That involve ritual methods</p>
<p>Will be successful when executed carefully,</p>
<p>Which is not the case for other individuals and rites.{15.68}</p>
<p>“So, too, the hateful mantras</p>
<p>That oppress other beings</p>
<p>Can, by the same token, interrupt the mantras of others</p>
<p>And succeed against angry beings. {15.69}</p>
<p>“Wrathful mantras will be successful</p>
<p>In seizing the property of others</p>
<p>Or arresting their life force;</p>
<p>Such activities should not be combined with other mantras. {15.70}</p>
<p>“A being predisposed to hatred</p>
<p>Can attain dominion over others;</p>
<p>He may be of a black, dark,</p>
<p>White, or mixed complexion. {15.71}</p>
<p>“An ordinary human predisposed to anger</p>
<p>Cannot possibly have a golden complexion;</p>
<p>Such a person will have a rough and smoke-colored</p>
<p>Or tawny complexion. {15.72}</p>
<p>“One born in the sign of Scorpio</p>
<p>Is heroic, cruel, and lustful,</p>
<p>Being in the house of the planet Mars.</p>
<p>One who is under the influence of Jupiter is predisposed to phlegm. {15.73}</p>
<p>“Such a person will eat little</p>
<p>And be fond of pungent and sour tastes.</p>
<p>His life will be long</p>
<p>And his memory good. {15.74}</p>
<p>“Now I will describe the activities and mannerisms</p>
<p>Of a person by nature predisposed to wind.</p>
<p>He has an unhealthy or rough complexion</p>
<p>But, in general, is not too weak. {15.75}</p>
<p>“He is of feeble intellect and little knowledge,</p>
<p>Unstable, and ungrounded.</p>
<p>With a trembling body, tottering,</p>
<p>He vomits a lot and frequently defecates and urinates. {15.76}</p>
<p>“He eats a lot and all the time,</p>
<p>And he talks a lot.</p>
<p>Being hostile to everyone,</p>
<p>He has many enemies. {15.77}</p>
<p>“He is undisciplined and unhappy</p>
<p>In his life on earth.</p>
<p>Mantras for becoming invisible</p>
<p>Are said to succeed if used by him. {15.78}</p>
<p>“He delights in foods</p>
<p>That stir up the humor of wind.</p>
<p>A mantra reciter should, however, never eat them,</p>
<p>If he wants his activity to be successful. {15.79}</p>
<p>“Beings agitated due to the humor of wind</p>
<p>Are predisposed to the arising of ignorance.</p>
<p>They are described as belonging to the delusion type,</p>
<p>And become accomplished in stupefying mantras.{15.80}</p>
<p>“For those who are of the deluded type,</p>
<p>It is always desired to be accomplished in causing stupefaction.</p>
<p>One should ascertain the asterisms of the water signs</p>
<p>To know the true significance of planetary influences.{15.81}</p>
<p>“One should not perform peaceful activities</p>
<p>If one is of the wind type and confused.</p>
<p>Likewise, one should not perform the enthralling,</p>
<p>Attracting, stupefying, or destroying of beings. {15.82}</p>
<p>“Regarding the arising of delusion-generated evil</p>
<p>In beings dominated by the humor of wind,</p>
<p>The following signs have been taught</p>
<p>That indicate the truth in dreams. {15.83}</p>
<p>“They have been previously described by sages</p>
<p>As serving the interests of beings.</p>
<p>Aries, Taurus, Gemini,</p>
<p>Cancer, Leo, {15.84}</p>
<p>“Libra, Virgo, Scorpio,</p>
<p>Sagittarius, Capricorn,</p>
<p>Aquarius, Pisces, the elephants,</p>
<p>The celestials, the monkeys, the asuras, {15.85}</p>
<p>“The siddhas, the gandharvas, the yakṣas, and so forth—</p>
<p>All those renowned to humanity—</p>
<p>The zodiac signs have been taught</p>
<p>By the supreme ones to the masses. {15.86}</p>
<p>“Different activities have been described,</p>
<p>Of many types and various purposes.</p>
<p>In all these activities and the accumulated karma,</p>
<p>A wide range of qualities comes to fruition. {15.87}</p>
<p>“It has been taught that for ordinary beings</p>
<p>No activity is devoid of such qualities.</p>
<p>Thus, one who engages in activities takes rebirth</p>
<p>Based on the qualities [of his karma].{15.88}</p>
<p>“When these qualities are infused with religious merit,</p>
<p>The practice of mantras will be successful.</p>
<p>The reciter who understands the true nature of such qualities</p>
<p>Understands the merits and defects of his karmic bonds.{15.89}</p>
<p>“If the authentic ritual procedure is not performed,</p>
<p>The activity will not take place, even if the qualities are present.</p>
<p>This is because the ritual produces the activity;</p>
<p>Such ritual is not without its qualities.{15.90}</p>
<p>“One who possesses the karmic qualities</p>
<p>For performing rituals will succeed.</p>
<p>Such ritual activities, along with their procedures,</p>
<p>Have been formerly taught by those with the ten powers. {15.91}</p>
<p>“The karmic qualities for [performing specific] rites</p>
<p>Are indicated by the beings’ behavioral tendencies.</p>
<p>The different forms they see in dreams are regarded, similarly,</p>
<p>As the products of their karmic activities. {15.92}</p>
<p>“Thus, based on the signs received in dreams,</p>
<p>One can determine the full range of activities to engage in.</p>
<p>Signs of different forms,</p>
<p>Some pleasing and nice to look at, {15.93}</p>
<p>“Others ugly, or with forms of obstacles,</p>
<p>Will appear in dreams.</p>
<p>People who desire accomplishments</p>
<p>Should be very enthusiastic and diligent. {15.94}</p>
<p>“The accomplishments will come to them</p>
<p>In terms of being of the highest, medium, or lowest range.</p>
<p>Activities that are violent and cruel</p>
<p>Always bring on dreams immediately [indicative] of the ripening fruits. {15.95}</p>
<p>“Regarding the highest, steadfast activities,</p>
<p>They will be accomplished after a long time.</p>
<p>Worldly activities of those who are predominantly worldly</p>
<p>Will produce [corresponding karmic] qualities.{15.96}</p>
<p>“There are many dreams that occur to mantra reciters</p>
<p>That indicate their accomplishment of the mantra.</p>
<p>Lethargic sleep portends that</p>
<p>The mantra will not be accomplished. {15.97}</p>
<p>“In that situation it is recommended to recite</p>
<p>The mantra that destroys the obstacles.</p>
<p>One should employ at that time</p>
<p>A mantra that is appropriate for reciters. {15.98}</p>
<p>“The prescribed [mantra] is the six-armed</p>
<p>And six-faced [Mañjuśrī] Mahākrodha.</p>
<p>His four-syllable great mantra</p>
<p>Resides within his youthful form. {15.99}</p>
<p>“He is of a terrible aspect and very frightening,</p>
<p>Manifesting in a form of a boar</p>
<p>In order to destroy the obstacles;</p>
<p>Black as night, he is the king of gods. {15.100}</p>
<p>“He is dressed in a tiger skin</p>
<p>And adorned with snakes with expanded hoods.</p>
<p>This great being holds a sword in his hand</p>
<p>And appears in the form of Death of great splendor. {15.101}</p>
<p>“He is tough on all obstacle makers</p>
<p>And ends the life of vināyakas.</p>
<p>Hear, all the beings, his mantra,</p>
<p>The fiercest in the tantras.{15.102}</p>
<p>“This mantra removes all obstacles</p>
<p>From any given being.</p>
<p>It accomplishes all mantras.</p>
<p>Assembled gods, hear me! {15.103}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers! The mantra is:</p>
<p>“He he, Mahā­krodha! The six-faced, six-legged destroyer of all obstacles, hūṁ hūṁ! Why do you tarry? O destroyer of the life of vināyakas, destroy my bad dreams! Lunge forward, lunge! Remember your pledge! Phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!”{15.104}</p>
<p>As soon as this king, the Lord of Wrath, was pronounced, all the vināyakas and obstructers became disturbed and frightened. With fainting hearts and panicked minds, they paid homage to Lord Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, and remained samaya-bound to them. {15.105}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then looked at the entire realm of the Pure Abode, and said this to the great assembly of his followers:</p>
<p>“Ho ho, assembly of gods! He is the Lord of Wrath. While any of the worldly or transcendent mantras are being accomplished, the Lord of Wrath will tame any evil being that causes harm to the reciter, along with the culprit’s family. He will cause them to wither but will not take their lives. Having burnt them and dried them up, he will assign a role to them, appointing them to protect, support, and guard the reciter. The being thus appointed will have to sustain the reciter. Any such being who would transgress this obligation and harm the practitioner who is under the protection of the Lord of Wrath {15.106}</p>
<p>“Will have his head split into seven pieces by the Lord of Wrath,</p>
<p>Like a garland of arjaka tree blossoms.”</p>
<p>Having spoken thus, the foremost one among sages</p>
<p>Said this to Mañjughoṣa: {15.107}</p>
<p>“Divine youth! Your mantras fulfill</p>
<p>All aims, the whole range of aims,</p>
<p>Especially for practitioners who</p>
<p>Pursue the aims of the mantra system. {15.108}</p>
<p>“This mantra has been taught by the Lord of Wrath in the tantras</p>
<p>As the one that destroys all obstacles.</p>
<p>It has been formerly employed</p>
<p>For this purpose by the lords of the world, the buddhas, {15.109}</p>
<p>“Namely for destroying evil obstacle makers</p>
<p>And appeasing the anger of enemies.</p>
<p>For the reciters it is necessary</p>
<p>To always recite it at nighttime.{15.110}</p>
<p>“It affords protection to sentient beings</p>
<p>And destroys bad dreams.</p>
<p>It has been taught by the supreme among people, the buddhas,</p>
<p>As being able to accomplish the aims of all mantras. {15.111}</p>
<p>“I will further teach</p>
<p>The auspicious characteristics of men</p>
<p>For whom the mantras are successful—</p>
<p>Those of the highest, medium, and the lowest types. {15.112}</p>
<p>“One who is energetic and intelligent;</p>
<p>Has a golden complexion, a large belly,</p>
<p>Elongated eyes, and smooth skin;</p>
<p>Is dispassionate and free of anger; {15.113}</p>
<p>“Has red eye-corners and speaks nicely,</p>
<p>For him accomplishment is of the highest type.</p>
<p>One with delicate skin, a dark complexion,</p>
<p>And slim limbs that are not too long; {15.114}</p>
<p>“Who is full of enthusiasm and energy,</p>
<p>Content, virtuous in every respect,</p>
<p>And pure on the account of his high birth;</p>
<p>Who has few desires, and is of weak constitution,{15.115}</p>
<p>“His accomplishment is certain—</p>
<p>It will be of the highest kind in all activities.</p>
<p>One whose body is not in any way inferior;</p>
<p>Who is dark as panic grass, full of vigor, {15.116}</p>
<p>“Untroubled in mind, intelligent,</p>
<p>Always celibate and pure,</p>
<p>And always fond of fine clothes;</p>
<p>Who knows the ways of the world, is disciplined, {15.117}</p>
<p>“Has many friends, is always detached,</p>
<p>And eats moderately;</p>
<p>And who is pure, skilled, and moral,</p>
<p>Always enjoys pure conduct, {15.118}</p>
<p>“Speaks the truth, and is compassionate</p>
<p>Will reach the highest type of accomplishment.</p>
<p>One not missing any limbs, full of qualities,</p>
<p>Born to a good family, always adhering to the Dharma, {15.119}</p>
<p>“Devoted to his mother and father,</p>
<p>Reverential toward brahmins and guests,</p>
<p>Very compassionate, and steadfast</p>
<p>Will reach the highest type of accomplishment. {15.120}</p>
<p>“One of pure, dark complexion and smooth skin,</p>
<p>Who speaks little and always remains pure,</p>
<p>Wants only the food and drink that are pure,</p>
<p>Has sex only with pure partners,{15.121}</p>
<p>“Knows the ways of the world, and is highly respected</p>
<p>Will reach the highest type of accomplishment.</p>
<p>One who is neither too short nor too tall,</p>
<p>Has hair as black as antimony powder, {15.122}</p>
<p>“Has loving eyes, is pure,</p>
<p>Always enjoys bathing,</p>
<p>And is propitiatory toward the Three Jewels</p>

<p>That are wonderful and venerated by the world.{15.232}</p>
<p>“This king of mantras engages in these activities</p>
<p>For the benefit of large numbers of beings.</p>
<p>He, Mañjughoṣa the divine youth,</p>
<p>Carries out the Buddha’s work. {15.233}</p>
<p>“There is both virtue and nonvirtue in the world—</p>
<p>His purpose is to spread good qualities.</p>
<p>If I am requested, I will teach;</p>
<p>Not requesting is said to be non-Dharma.{15.234}</p>
<p>“It is taught by the Buddha</p>
<p>Solely for the benefit of every being.</p>
<p>It has been taught by the past buddhas</p>
<p>And will now be taught by me{15.235}</p>
<p>“With the earnest desire that the lineage</p>
<p>Of the buddhas remains unbroken,</p>
<p>And that omniscient wisdom arises</p>
<p>In all activities of the mantra practitioners. {15.236}</p>
<p>“The only activity that deserves to be praised</p>
<p>Is the one based on omniscient knowledge.</p>
<p>Since previous actions performed in one’s respective world</p>
<p>Are being experienced now,{15.237}</p>
<p>“One should perform the [right] activities,</p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to perform them in this life.</p>
<p>Based on these activities, the mantras will succeed</p>
<p>Without effort even in this life. {15.238}</p>
<p>“The accomplishment will come in this life,</p>
<p>Manifesting also in one’s activity.</p>
<p>The ritual activity is therefore</p>
<p>Extolled by all the buddhas as something unique. {15.239}</p>
<p>“When such activity is performed according to procedure,</p>
<p>The accomplishment will swiftly follow, even in this life.</p>
<p>Naive and careless beings,</p>
<p>Who are ignorant of the right procedure, follow erroneous paths. {15.240}</p>
<p>“Thus these activities alone, with all their aspects,</p>
<p>Have been deemed praiseworthy.</p>
<p>The activity should follow the procedure;</p>
<p>If it does, it will be successful.</p>
<p>Activity that lacks the right procedure</p>
<p>Will not succeed even after a very long time.{15.241}</p>
<p>“There is no liberation without samādhi;</p>
<p>Liberation is never devoid of samādhi.</p>
<p>Accordingly, awakening is said</p>
<p>To combine samādhi and liberation.” {15.242}</p>
<p>This concludes the chapter with detailed instructions on the meaning of all ritual activities, fifteenth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 16</p>
<p>The blessed Śākyamuni looked again at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī! Requested by the wise king of yakṣas who holds a vajra in his hand, I already taught in detail, in the middle of this assembly, your complete chapter on the ritual activities intended for all purposes.{16.1}</p>
<p>“I taught about the good and bad aspects of dreams</p>
<p>And how they relate to all the mantra purposes.</p>
<p>I taught all of it at length</p>
<p>For the mantra reciters.”{16.2}</p>
<p>The king of yakṣas, pleased at heart,</p>
<p>Folded his hands at his forehead and,</p>
<p>Bowing his head before the Teacher,</p>
<p>Said at that time, {16.3}</p>
<p>“The one of supreme intellect taught</p>
<p>Out of his kindness for the people,</p>
<p>Out of his compassion for me,</p>
<p>And for the happiness of beings, {16.4}</p>
<p>“About the good and bad aspects</p>
<p>Of all the mantras and dreams of the reciters,</p>
<p>About the extensive qualities of the conduct</p>
<p>Of noble and debased beings,</p>
<p>And about determining the causes</p>
<p>For the highest birth and destiny.{16.5}</p>
<p>“He taught the knowledge of what is beneficial</p>
<p>And detrimental—past, present, and future.</p>
<p>He taught the complete, all-encompassing knowledge—</p>
<p>The dynamic aspect of all-knowing awareness. {16.6}</p>
<p>“He taught about the auspicious tranquility described</p>
<p>As being without a visible form, without support,</p>
<p>Which expands without mental elaboration</p>
<p>And is endowed with all the supreme aspects. {16.7}</p>
<p>“The one of superior intellect</p>
<p>Described the powers of all the buddhas</p>
<p>In particular for those reciters</p>
<p>Who pursue all the aims of mantra. {16.8}</p>
<p>“He taught the ritual activity, its complete result,</p>
<p>And the right time for the rituals;</p>
<p>He taught about the vessel, the place, and the possession,</p>
<p>Which teachings were requested in the context of dreams.”{16.9}</p>
<p>The king of yakṣas then bowed to the best of sages,</p>
<p>To the supreme seventh tathāgata.</p>
<p>Whatever buddhas appeared in the auspicious eon,</p>
<p>The Bull of the Śākyas was the seventh of them. {16.10}</p>
<p>He, Lion of the Śākyas who conquered the enemies,</p>
<p>Is regarded as the seventh—</p>
<p>The lord of the world,  the bringer of light,</p>
<p>A perfect buddha for the lowest eon, {16.11}</p>
<p>A sage of great diligence and wisdom,</p>
<p>Renowned for his great energy.</p>
<p>It was to him that the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi</p>
<p>Bowed in homage. {16.12}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the wise one, stayed silent</p>
<p>And remained in his seat.</p>
<p>The [seventh] sage then spoke to him,</p>
<p>The sagacious one, as follows: {16.13}</p>
<p>“[Vajrapāṇi] requested the Buddha,</p>
<p>The most recent and chief among sages,</p>
<p>‘It is good, O fully awakened Blessed One!</p>
<p>Please teach at length the knowledge of ritual activities. {16.14}</p>
<p>“ ‘Teach how one’s birth horoscope constitutes the chief factor</p>
<p>In explaining one’s virtuous and nonvirtuous character traits;</p>
<p>Explain the actions of many beings</p>
<p>Based on the understanding of karmic causes; {16.15}</p>
<p>“ ‘Teach about the signs of the reciters’ accomplishments,</p>
<p>Differentiated in terms of what should and should not be accomplished,</p>
<p>[The signs] exhibited by those entered into and possessed [by spirits],</p>
<p>And the reciters who pursue various virtuous goals;{16.16}</p>
<p>“ ‘Teach also, for the sake of those who desire, in this world,</p>
<p>Riches, power, and enjoyments,</p>
<p>For those who want to rise to prominence and obtain a kingdom,</p>
<p>And for those who want to hold on to their success.{16.17}</p>
<p>“ ‘In short, please teach</p>
<p>The complete, all-pervading knowledge.’ ”</p>
<p>So spoke the supreme sage,</p>
<p>When requested by [Vajrapāṇi,] the son of the victorious ones.{16.18}</p>
<p>The seventh sage then spoke [the following] stanzas</p>
<p>In the pure voice of the Buddha’s speech.</p>
<p>The wise one had a voice like that of a cuckoo bird,</p>
<p>Spreading like the sound of a celestial drum,</p>
<p>As sweet as Brahmā’s, and resounding like</p>
<p>A thunderous cloud of great might. {16.19}</p>
<p>“Those, O divine youth, who abide in the highest truth</p>
<p>Gain accomplishments to benefit the world.</p>
<p>They guide the world to every good fortune and benefit.</p>
<p>May [the accomplishments] of these lords of liberation remain pure.{16.20}</p>
<p>“Those who possess honesty, unwavering diligence, a sober mind,</p>
<p>And loving kindness and who always delight in generosity</p>
<p>Will always be successful;</p>
<p>Others will never succeed. {16.21}</p>
<p>“Those who always find joy and delight in the supreme mantra</p>
<p>And in the instructions of the wheel holder or of Mañjuvara</p>
<p>Will overpower Māra and turn the wheel,</p>
<p>Just as befits a wheel holder in this world. {16.22}</p>
<p>“There is a divine speech, pleasing to the mind,</p>
<p>From which, however, fools are ever separated.</p>
<p>This divine speech is pleasing to the ear, captivating,</p>
<p>Lovely, sweet, and agreeable. {16.23}</p>
<p>“It refreshes the mind and bestows happiness.</p>
<p>The buddhas call this speech Mañju.</p>
<p>But even they, with their superior knowledge of a tathāgata,</p>
<p>Are unable to understand his power.{16.24}</p>
<p>“Their sons who are established on their respective levels</p>
<p>And accordingly reckoned as falling into ten groups, perfect and divine,</p>
<p>Even they, O lord of gods, are unable</p>
<p>To understand his divine power, which surpasses the ordinary.{16.25}</p>
<p>“The same is true for the celestials of the form and formless realms,</p>
<p>Gods of the desire realm, or human beings,</p>
<p>Even if they have attained yogic accomplishments,</p>
<p>Or for outstanding individuals who surpass everyone else in this world. {16.26}</p>
<p>“There is no being anywhere</p>
<p>Who could fully understand his splendor.</p>
<p>The buddhas call him ‘Gentle Splendor,’</p>
<p>Knowing that splendor is merely a concept. {16.27}</p>
<p>“ ‘Gentle Splendor’ is an imputation,</p>
<p>A name given to you by the victors in the past.</p>
<p>It was imputed to you as your name</p>
<p>By the past, present, and future buddhas. {16.28}</p>
<p>“One who hears your name in saṃsāra</p>
<p>With a one-pointed mind that is neither distracted nor impure</p>
<p>Will obtain the auspicious peace</p>
<p>And awakening when still in saṃsāra.{16.29}</p>
<p>“He will accomplish all the mantras</p>
<p>And obtain the best possible rebirth and destiny.</p>
<p>One who always relies on the supreme Dharma</p>
<p>Will be free from obstacles and will attain accomplishment. {16.30}</p>
<p>“One will thus master all the desired mantras</p>
<p>And swiftly attain the pleasant awakening in this world.</p>
<p>The chief among sages arrives at the Bodhi tree</p>
<p>And sits there for the benefit of beings.{16.31}</p>
<p>“He awakens to realization and turns the wheel [of Dharma],</p>
<p>The quality of which has been described by the chief victors.</p>
<p>[The same] chief victors [also] described your name, remembered as</p>
<p>‘Glory’ (Śrī) that is called ‘Gentle’ (Mañju), as having inconceivable qualities. {16.32}</p>
<p>“The chief victors of the past, however many there have been,</p>
<p>Even if they were to explain your power continually</p>
<p>Over innumerable eons, would not be able to describe it</p>
<p>Nor [the power of] the hundreds of mantras, O pure divine youth! {16.33}</p>
<p>“All the buddhas, without exception, have taught</p>
<p>The complete mantra system of Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>These instructions of yours, O divine youth, cover everything,</p>
<p>And the diligent ones derive the highest pleasure from them.{16.34}</p>
<p>“Beings who dwell in the Pure Abode,</p>
<p>And all beings without exception, will attain peace</p>
<p>If they never violate your mantra</p>
<p>In any way whatsoever.”{16.35}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed sixteenth chapter with versified instructions in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra.</p>
<p>Chapter 17</p>
<p>Now Lord Śākyamuni entered the samādhi called the magical display of all the tathāgatas. As soon as he entered this samādhi, rays of blue, yellow, dazzling white, red, and crystal-colored light issued from the tuft of hair between his eyebrows. They brightened the entire buddhafield and illuminated the interior of every realm of the universe, while darkening all the planets and constellations and summoning them in an instant. After summoning them, the light assigned them to their respective places and drew them, by the power of the Buddha’s blessing, into the circle of the assembly. It then disappeared into the same tuft of hair between Lord Śākyamuni’s eyebrows. All the planets, constellations, and stars, their light blocked, approached Lord Śākyamuni, pained and frightened. They stood with folded hands, trembling and prostrating themselves on the ground again and again. {17.1}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then gave the following talk</p>
<p>For all the celestial bodies such as planets, constellations, and stars.</p>
<p>He gave it as an act of kindness for all the beings</p>
<p>Born with the intelligence of a child. {17.2}</p>
<p>“Listen, esteemed friends, hosts of gods along with men. The karma of individual beings causes them to experience the world differently. The way the bodies of beings manifest, whether the vajra bodies of the blessed buddhas  or the various bodies of gods, asuras, and humans circling in saṃsāra, lost in its wilderness—all of this is a product of karma. This karma, whether it is good or bad, still constitutes fetters. There is no creator here who creates, nor godhead, nor the puruṣa and prakṛti as espoused in the Sāṃkhya system. Nothing of this kind exists, except for that which is produced by karma. Everything that is generated in dependence upon karma thus has a cause. This cause, in turn, depends on its own causes and conditions. In this way, everything is mutually interconnected, being generated through dependent origination. Living beings are generated from the [five] great elements that coalesce together.{17.3}</p>
<p>“These great elements exist within the five aggregates throughout the beginningless transmigrations. They manifest in the place of another birth, developing into an elaborate [whole] with all the [constituent] parts. The habitual tendencies generated by karmic actions can, however, be completely burnt by the fire of gnosis that blocks and prevents [the arising of elements] at another time. One can effectively accomplish the equality of the three vehicles and the state without conceptual elaboration. This will happen as the result of the karma produced by following the Mahāyāna for a long time. Following [the Mahāyāna] for a medium length of time will bring about the self-arising gnosis of a rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddha. Within a short time, one can attain the regal state of a śrāvaka who listens to the teachings of others. If naive and confused people do not turn to non-Buddhist doctrines, their intelligence will grow.{17.4}</p>
<p>“This world, with its different places and situations, is produced by different types of karma. Its cessation—the auspicious state without old age, sorrowless and pure—[is produced by] karma based on worldly accomplishments that are pure, [namely] the detached eightfold karma that arises out of the [eightfold] path. Karma is produced by karma and has no other basis but itself. {17.5}</p>
<p>“One who is free from dualistic thinking</p>
<p>Will remain free from both action and inaction.</p>
<p>Following the threefold path, one will obtain</p>
<p>No other tranquility [but that of the path]. {17.6}</p>
<p>“The mantras thus fall into three groups,</p>
<p>And the [resulting] activity is of three kinds.</p>
<p>The fruit [thereof] is threefold</p>
<p>And the reflection [thereupon] is threefold too.{17.7}</p>
<p>“Inverted activity is threefold</p>
<p>And is regarded as such.</p>
<p>Virtue is regarded as threefold,</p>
<p>As can be gleaned from the tantras.{17.8}</p>
<p>“The religious community is also such,</p>
<p>And so is the entire seat of the mantras.</p>
<p>The community of buddhas with pure minds</p>
<p>Abides in the peace of nirvāṇa. {17.9}</p>
<p>“This karma is here taught, section by section,</p>
<p>As part of the science of mantras.</p>
<p>For the sake of success in the world,</p>
<p>The discipline of astrology has also been taught.</p>
<p>Its subdivision, [the science of] karma,</p>
<p>Is part of the teachings on causation.{17.10}</p>
<p>“Just as [the cause in] a grain of rice</p>
<p>Can be inferred by the sprout,</p>
<p>So too [the cause in] the power substances</p>
<p>Can be inferred by their effects. {17.11}</p>
<p>“Just as the color white</p>
<p>Is imputed [to an object] based on a convention,</p>
<p>So, too, the astrological influences</p>
<p>Are imputed [to a person] based on conventions.</p>
<p>However, it is only karma that is deemed</p>
<p>Wholly responsible for all such influences. {17.12}</p>
<p>“Karma never resides in a body</p>
<p>Without being indicated by [certain] signs,</p>
<p>Such as marks, behavioral patterns, or a birth</p>
<p>Into a particular category of practitioners. {17.13}</p>
<p>“Karma can always be ascertained</p>
<p>By various omens.</p>
<p>Karma never itself possesses a body;</p>
<p>It is hidden and can be discerned by other [signs]. {17.14}</p>
<p>“[The condition of] a person thoroughly afflicted by fever</p>
<p>Is indicated by the alterations [in their appearance].</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, the karma that resides in the body</p>
<p>Of corporeal beings can be observed by them. {17.15}</p>
<p>“The zodiacal birth-horoscopes are widely explained</p>
<p>In terms of good or bad [karmic] results.</p>
<p>The various omens reflect the various types of karma</p>
<p>That beings are produced by.{17.16}</p>
<p>“One should always note the time,</p>
<p>The [mode of] locomotion, the different voices of beings,</p>
<p>The good and bad results</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . {17.17}</p>
<p>“To ascertain one’s karma, one should watch</p>
<p>For the signs of success or failure.</p>
<p>The telltale signs, the way of acting, and the marks</p>
<p>Have been designated as the ascertainment. {17.18}</p>
<p>“Therefore, one should take every care</p>
<p>When observing [the signs that constitute] the ascertainment.</p>
<p>If one is a mantra reciter, one should look</p>
<p>For the cause of one’s success in the mantra. {17.19}</p>
<p>“One should not regard one’s own karma</p>
<p>And the karma of others as separate.</p>
<p>Terrible and obstructing karmas</p>
<p>Could all go undetected.</p>
<p>All these branches [of knowledge] are therefore</p>
<p>The topic of the Sage’s teachings. {17.20}</p>
<p>“The omniscient Śālendra­rāja</p>
<p>Sat upon the seat of awakening</p>
<p>And pronounced the mantra</p>
<p>That removes all obstacles,</p>
<p>One that removes bad dreams,</p>
<p>Bad omens, and difficulties. {17.21}</p>
<p>“While the mind of the omniscient great being</p>
<p>Was thus steeped in awakening,</p>
<p>Māra, with his evil mind,</p>
<p>Created very frightening obstacles. {17.22}</p>
<p>“Śālendra­rāja, [sitting at] the root of the tree,</p>
<p>Saw that all this great terror was baseless;</p>
<p>The many frightening forms</p>
<p>Were, for him, without any basis. {17.23}</p>
<p>“Having made aspirations over a long period of time,</p>
<p>He accumulated merit and power;</p>
<p>Consequently, by the power of his mantra,</p>
<p>Namuci was defeated.{17.24}</p>
<p>“Śālendra­rāja is endowed with magical powers and great energy.</p>
<p>Being restrained, he possesses great splendor.</p>
<p>One should strive to obtain the supreme awakening,</p>
<p>Using the power of his mantra. {17.25}</p>
<p>“This mantra, which obliterates bad omens,</p>
<p>Will now by revealed.</p>
<p>It removes bad dreams and difficulties,</p>
<p>And wards off evil beings. {17.26}</p>
<p>“Please hear it, O hosts of gods;</p>
<p>This king of mantras [controls]</p>
<p>Planets, constellations, and other celestial entities.</p>
<p>It was formerly taught by the victorious Śālendra­rāja. {17.27}</p>
<p>“It is used in order to suppress the wicked</p>
<p>Planets, constellations, and stars,</p>
<p>And to awaken gentle thoughts</p>
<p>In all beings. {17.28}</p>
<p>“Please hear it, O hosts of spirits,</p>
<p>All of you who roam the earth!</p>
<p>Those without legs, with many legs,</p>
<p>Or with two or four legs!</p>
<p>In short, all the beings and inanimate objects</p>
<p>Present in the three worlds.{17.29}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas, the perfect teachers!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, kha kha! Eat, eat! Huṁ huṁ! Burn, burn! Blaze, blaze! Remain, remain! Ṣṇīḥ, phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!</p>
<p>“This mantra is known by the name of Jvāloṣṇīṣa,</p>
<p>Its dazzling white light coming from the Buddha.{17.30}</p>
<p>“There are thousands of rites—</p>
<p>Eighty, nine and five.</p>
<p>One who performs various rites</p>
<p>With his thoughts completely attuned to virtue</p>
<p>Can destroy bad dreams and omens</p>
<p>With a single repetition [of the Jvāloṣṇīṣa]. {17.31}</p>
<p>“One may perform other rites,</p>
<p>Having mastered all the mantras;</p>
<p>This mantra[, however, the Jvāloṣṇīṣa,] is a buddha,</p>
<p>A powerful master who enthralls sentient beings.{17.32}</p>
<p>“Through merely calling this mantra to mind,</p>
<p>All the obstacles will be destroyed,</p>
<p>And one will become a perfect buddha superior to the gods.”</p>
<p>Having spoken this, the supreme among sages {17.33}</p>
<p>Remained silent for a while,</p>
<p>And looked on.</p>
<p>The hosts of gods, too,</p>
<p>Waited above the Pure Abode. {17.34}</p>
<p>All the chief deities</p>
<p>[Who personify] the constellations, planets, and stars,</p>
<p>Frightened, took their samaya vows</p>
<p>As they were told the mantra of Uṣṇīṣa.{17.35}</p>
<p>The lords called uṣṇīṣa are capable,</p>
<p>Very diligent, and of great brilliance.</p>
<p>They are said to be four or five hundred in number,</p>
<p>Or seven, eight, ninety,{17.36}</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty, thirty-five, or another—</p>
<p>So it has been proclaimed.</p>
<p>The number of these auspicious kings</p>
<p>That are born from the [Buddha’s] head is incalculable.</p>
<p>The aforementioned mantra is identical with them,</p>
<p>As explained by the victors in the past.{17.37}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on the ascertainment of one’s personal karma, seventeenth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>The blessed Śākyamuni now addressed all the most important grahas among the constellations, planets, stars, and celestial bodies that exist in all the world spheres—the grahas dwelling in all the directions and endowed with great magical powers: {24.1}</p>
<p>“Listen, venerable friends, to my presentation on the respective powers of all the planets and constellations. Show your power, sirs, and accomplish the purpose of all the rituals involving the mantra. Keep your samayas and eagerly pursue an accomplishment in the doctrine contained in this sovereign manual of Mañjughoṣa and later expounded in other manuals as well.” {24.2}</p>
<p>In the interest of all beings, the blessed Śākyamuni then taught about the action of the grahas. He, the omniscient one, taught everything for the benefit of all mantra reciters and in order to fulfill the aims of the mantra [system]. {24.3}</p>
<p>“The three nakṣatras,</p>
<p>Aśvinī, Bharaṇī, and Kṛttikā,</p>
<p>Are ruled by the planet Mars. {24.4}</p>
<p>“They are said to belong to the zodiacal sign of Aries,</p>
<p>And no accomplishment will arise [when the moon is] in them.</p>
<p>Accomplishments are classified into</p>
<p>The highest, medium, and lowest types.</p>
<p>One should not embark on any journey</p>
<p>Whenever one is obstructed by the cruel planet. {24.5}</p>
<p>“Rohiṇī and Mṛgaśirā, along with Ārdrā,</p>
<p>Are said to be nakṣatras too,</p>
<p>And so are the celebrated</p>
<p>Punarvasus, Puṣya, and Āśleṣā. {24.6}</p>
<p>“Further, there are Maghā, the two Phalgunī,</p>
<p>As well as Hastā, Citrā,</p>
<p>Svāti, Viśākhā, Anurādhā,</p>
<p>Jyeṣṭhā, and Mūlā. {24.7}</p>
<p>“The two Āṣāḍhās are praised as auspicious</p>
<p>And good for mantra reciters.</p>
<p>The nakṣatras of Śravaṇā and Dhaniṣṭhā</p>
<p>Are recommended for cruel rites. {24.8}</p>
<p>“Both Śatabhiṣā and the two Bhadrapadās</p>
<p>Are conducive to accomplishment.</p>
<p>Revatī brings good fortune</p>
<p>And also competence and fearlessness in battle. {24.9}</p>
<p>“The main ones among the remaining nakṣatras</p>
<p>Do not occur during the lowest eon.</p>
<p>Abhijit is known to have an auspicious influence</p>
<p>And to bring accomplishments and merit.</p>
<p>Tiṣya is secondary in importance;</p>
<p>It is the last and the least significant.{24.10}</p>
<p>“Truth and honesty are praised</p>
<p>As the light of the world.</p>
<p>[This light] brings happiness and virtue</p>
<p>When unobstructed, but can also be obstructed.</p>
<p>It is a majestic king that grants renown,</p>
<p>And it is the king of the world.{24.11}</p>
<p>“Nakṣatras are said to be many—</p>
<p>Sixty-four thousand in all.</p>
<p>However, during this lowest eon</p>
<p>They do not possess this power.</p>
<p>They are taught in this king of manuals that brings happiness</p>
<p>Simply for the sake of information. {24.12}</p>
<p>“During the golden age,</p>
<p>Beings’ powers manifested by themselves.</p>
<p>They all could travel through space</p>
<p>And were free from old age and death. {24.13}</p>
<p>“At that time there were no nakṣatras,</p>
<p>No sun or moon, and no stars.</p>
<p>During the best of eons at the beginning of time</p>
<p>There were no gods and no asuras. {24.14}</p>
<p>“There were no names and no clans;</p>
<p>No lunar days and no birth horoscopes;</p>
<p>No fasts, no mantras,</p>
<p>And no karma, whether good or bad. {24.15}</p>
<p>“Beings could wander as they pleased</p>
<p>Without food or eating.</p>
<p>They were always</p>
<p>Very pure and healthy.{24.16}</p>
<p>“However, their consciousness became ‘seized,’</p>
<p>Making them into worldly beings.</p>
<p>Drawn by their previous karma</p>
<p>They subsequently fell down to earth, {24.17}</p>
<p>“Where they lived in celestial mansions,</p>
<p>Commingling with gods and asuras.</p>
<p>Then, when the middle eon arrived,</p>
<p>They took on human bodies. {24.18}</p>
<p>“Being fond of food and drink,</p>
<p>They lost their [physical] luster.</p>
<p>Their bodies became solid,</p>
<p>And their conduct ambivalent—good and bad. {24.19}</p>
<p>“From then on they became bounded by</p>
<p>Days, months, planets, and other celestial bodies.</p>
<p>From that time onward,</p>
<p>Whatever astrological knowledge there was, {24.20}</p>
<p>“I taught all of it, showing patience</p>
<p>And kindness to sentient beings.</p>
<p>I formerly assumed the appearance of sages,</p>
<p>Such as the sagacious Brahmā. {24.21}</p>
<p>“I took on the body of Maheśvara</p>
<p>And also assumed the guise of Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>I used a body of a female garuḍa,</p>
<p>And the bodies of yakṣas, rākṣasas, and gandharvas.{24.22}</p>
<p>“I was born in a body of a female piśāca,</p>
<p>And I was born again and again,</p>
<p>Becoming, in these consecutive births,</p>
<p>A skillful bodhisattva. {24.23}</p>
<p>“I was a bodhisattva in the past,</p>
<p>During that particular eon,</p>
<p>Because of my power to always choose</p>
<p>A birth suitable for practicing the conduct of awakening. {24.24}</p>
<p>“I also was, in former times,</p>
<p>A naive person veiled by the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>In this world, however many disciplines of</p>
<p>Knowledge, crafts, and occupations there are—{24.25}</p>
<p>“Whatever is found in the scientific treatises,</p>
<p>Works on polity, the Purāṇas, the Vedas, works on grammar,</p>
<p>Sacred hymns, or works on astrology or arithmetic—</p>
<p>All are regarded as conceptual construct,{24.26}</p>
<p>“False knowledge, and ignorance,</p>
<p>As well as mistaken conduct.</p>
<p>I formerly recited in this world</p>
<p>All the treatises for a long time, {24.27}</p>
<p>“Yet I found no knowledge whereby</p>
<p>I could become a sage who remains at peace—</p>
<p>A knowledge that brings awakening</p>
<p>And also constitutes the cause of liberation. {24.28}</p>
<p>“My actions confined me in the prison of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>Rather than deliver me into</p>
<p>Stainless buddhahood and peaceful nirvāṇa</p>
<p>From where there is no falling back. {24.29}</p>
<p>“But now I have attained the perfect awakening</p>
<p>That I had desired for so long.</p>
<p>I attained it solely by myself,</p>
<p>By applying the rituals as prescribed.{24.30}</p>
<p>“I attained the self-arising knowledge</p>
<p>That was formerly taught by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>I do not see the state attained</p>
<p>By external methods as the same.{24.31}</p>
<p>“When lost in the wastelands of saṃsāra</p>
<p>Where causes of awakening are difficult to find,</p>
<p>I could not obtain knowledge</p>
<p>Of the kind that arises by itself. {24.32}</p>
<p>“But now, as I have attained nirvāṇa by employing</p>
<p>The ritual activity and delighting in what is good,</p>
<p>I will teach specifically</p>
<p>This collection of topics. {24.33}</p>
<p>“Without ritual activity,</p>
<p>Causes of accomplishment cannot be won.</p>
<p>This yarn of saṃsāric existence is very long;</p>
<p>It is woven and held together by karma. {24.34}</p>
<p>“This yarn has many destinies [strung along it].</p>
<p>The nakṣatras, grahas, and other astrological entities</p>
<p>Merely indicate the good and bad [results]</p>
<p>That are in the process of ripening. {24.35}</p>
<p>“For people not attuned to the Dharma</p>
<p>No other signs can be observed [except for the planets and so forth.]</p>
<p>Consequently, the planets and other [astrological entities]</p>
<p>Are said to fall into the categories of either good or bad. {24.36}</p>
<p>“The four guardians of the world—</p>
<p>Water, earth, wind, and light—</p>
<p>Are known to constitute the celestial luminaries.</p>
<p>These same [four] great elements</p>
<p>Account for [all] the assemblages of elements.{24.37}</p>
<p>“Thus they conglomerate to form living beings</p>
<p>When stirred to do so by karma.</p>
<p>The mantras will be successful</p>
<p>Within the limitations of [astrological?] time periods.{24.38}</p>
<p>“In these births, one should be protected</p>
<p>With great care, in weal and in woe.</p>
<p>For this task, at the time at the end of the eon,</p>
<p>The lords of gods have been assigned.</p>
<p>They are Śakra and so forth,</p>
<p>Distinguished and eminent in the world. {24.39}</p>
<p>“The mantras, applied with care,</p>
<p>Will produce accomplishments during the lowest eon.</p>
<p>Because of this, the victorious ones</p>
<p>Appointed the divine youth— {24.40}</p>
<p>“Mañjughoṣa of great wisdom,</p>
<p>In the form of a young boy.</p>
<p>He will wander throughout this entire world,</p>
<p>Ready to show kindness to beings. {24.41}</p>
<p>“At that time achievements pertinent to</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa will be seen—</p>
<p>The science of astrology</p>
<p>Will come into existence at that time. {24.42}</p>
<p>“At that time, during the lowest eon,</p>
<p>The twenty-seven nakṣatras will become known,</p>
<p>As will the muhūrtas,</p>
<p>And the twelve signs of the zodiac. {24.43}</p>
<p>“The planets are assigned to the zodiacal constellations</p>
<p>Of the nakṣatras, which they inhabit.</p>
<p>Occupying wide spaces,</p>
<p>They each have a separate location.{24.44}</p>
<p>“Regarding their horoscope and course of life,</p>
<p>Beings depend upon their birth sign.</p>
<p>They are born ignorant, do things the wrong way,</p>
<p>And reap good and bad results. {24.45}</p>
<p>“For that reason, their birth sign can indicate</p>
<p>Their [particular] karma time and again.</p>
<p>[These signs] determine what course will be successful</p>
<p>For beings to pursue, whether it is virtuous or not. {24.46}</p>
<p>“If the nakṣatra linked to the birth horoscope</p>
<p>Has been charted out as Rohiṇī,</p>
<p>One will enjoy good fortune,</p>
<p>Have many sons, and live a long life. {24.47}</p>
<p>“One will always be wealthy</p>
<p>And will do well as the general of an army.</p>
<p>If one’s birth sign is Taurus</p>
<p>And this constellation is traversed</p>
<p>In the nakṣatra of Mṛgaśirā,</p>
<p>One will understand people and be virtuous and good looking. {24.48}</p>
<p>“Similarly, if the Kṛttikā part of Taurus is traversed</p>
<p>And ‘King’ looks upon Earth,</p>
<p>One could become a ruler over the three oceans.</p>
<p>This may manifest based on one’s birth horoscope. {24.49}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, one may become a king in a province,</p>
<p>Or a place difficult to access.</p>
<p>If the planet is designated as Jupiter</p>
<p>And one’s horoscope is right, {24.50}</p>
<p>“One will come to enjoy</p>
<p>The entire earth all around;</p>
<p>One may be appointed to kingship</p>
<p>Within ten or five years. {24.51}</p>
<p>“One born under the sign of Aries,</p>
<p>Which spans the nakṣatras Aśvinī, Bharaṇī,</p>
<p>And a part of Kṛttikā, is very smart.</p>
<p>He would do well in business and accumulate much wealth. {24.52}</p>
<p>“If, through one’s birth sign,</p>
<p>One is endowed with power and pleasures,</p>
<p>But, at the time of one’s birth</p>
<p>A red disk of the sun, {24.53}</p>
<p>“When it is about to set, is in one’s nakṣatra,</p>
<p>Things will go wrong—</p>
<p>One will be born cruel, impetuous,</p>
<p>And prone to telling lies. {24.54}</p>
<p>“One is then observed, in one’s life on earth,</p>
<p>To have delicate skin of reddish hue,</p>
<p>And, it is said, one will open and close</p>
<p>One’s eyes at the time of one’s birth. {24.55}</p>
<p>“One born at these junctures</p>
<p>Will possess these qualities in abundance.</p>
<p>However, as for those whose delivery at birth</p>
<p>Is said to take the time equal to a finger snap, {24.56}</p>
<p>“They do not fit their [astrological] stereotype,</p>
<p>As they are deprived of their planetary influences.</p>
<p>Beings are born different,</p>
<p>As their birth influences are a combination of many things.{24.57}</p>
<p>“The modes of existence that manifest for them</p>
<p>Are mixed, and so are their fortunes.</p>
<p>For that reason they are not born</p>
<p>Exactly as their horoscopes describe. {24.58}</p>
<p>“Astrologically, there are thirty types of birth influences;</p>
<p>They bring results that may be good or bad.</p>
<p>Those who are marked by the planet Mars</p>
<p>Will be of the cruel type (jāti). {24.59}</p>
<p>“One who is under the influence of Jupiter</p>
<p>Is always born steadfast,</p>
<p>With a prominent belly, lovely appearance,</p>
<p>And elongated eyes, and soft-spoken. {24.60}</p>
<p>“Similarly, if the deities Sun and Moon have both risen</p>
<p>And the sun is four angular cubits above the horizon,</p>
<p>One can definitely expect a birth</p>
<p>That is continually auspicious, day and night. {24.61}</p>
<p>“Those with other horoscopes that are unfavorable,</p>
<p>Who have been allotted [at birth] the opposite lot,</p>
<p>Ought to gain control of their planetary influences [that govern]</p>
<p>The positive and negative aspects of their inauspicious birth.{24.62}</p>
<p>“When the unwholesome results manifest, one can thus bring on,</p>
<p>Through correct knowledge, that which is wholesome.</p>
<p>Having taken a particular birth,</p>
<p>One belongs, in this birth, to an astrological house. {24.63}</p>
<p>“Beings [born] under the influence of the planet Venus</p>
<p>Are by nature noble and pure.</p>
<p>I will now describe [the influence of] the nakṣatras</p>
<p>Of Ārdrā, the Punarvasus, and a part of Āśleṣā.{24.64}</p>
<p>“A person born under these nakṣatras is very generous,</p>
<p>But also impetuous and deceitful.</p>
<p>He is always attached to women, lustful,</p>
<p>And full of hatred whether with or without a motive. {24.65}</p>
<p>“He makes sexual advances on other people’s wives,</p>
<p>And his [skin color] is black or dark.</p>
<p>He is born with a smoky complexion,</p>
<p>Is very fierce, and is fond of sex. {24.66}</p>
<p>“One may be born under the sign of Gemini</p>
<p>With Saturn, positioned there,</p>
<p>Slowly traversing [the sign]</p>
<p>Day and night, bit by bit. {24.67}</p>
<p>“If such a person is born at midday,</p>
<p>He will possess great mental faculties.</p>
<p>This is said to be the guiding characteristic</p>
<p>For someone born at this time. {24.68}</p>
<p>“He will own great wealth</p>
<p>And be distinguished on earth by power and influence.</p>
<p>If one is born in the nakṣatra of Puṣya or Āśleṣā,</p>
<p>One’s zodiac sign is Cancer. {24.69}</p>
<p>“For such a person, a connection</p>
<p>With Jupiter betokens great magical powers.</p>
<p>One’s complexion will be yellowish.</p>
<p>This birth is proclaimed to be the best. {24.70}</p>
<p>“For a person [of this sign] born at midnight,</p>
<p>The following horoscope is given:</p>
<p>One born at this time</p>
<p>Will generally seek goodness and truth.{24.71}</p>
<p>“Such a person will accomplish all his tasks,</p>
<p>If he applies the prescribed methods.</p>
<p>He will obtain a kingdom and wealth,</p>
<p>Starting already in childhood. {24.72}</p>
<p>“His complexion will be yellowish or dark,</p>
<p>And he will appear healthy and strong.</p>
<p>He will delight in pure conduct,</p>
<p>Will have good fortune, and will be fearless. {24.73}</p>
<p>“When the nakṣatras of Maghā, [the first] Phalgunī,</p>
<p>And a part of the second Phalgunī</p>
<p>Become the sun’s house,</p>
<p>The designated sign is that of Leo. {24.74}</p>
<p>“Great heroes are born under this sign,</p>
<p>Who are fond of eating meat.</p>
<p>They establish their power and kingdom</p>
<p>In mountainous places difficult to access. {24.75}</p>
<p>“[Whatever planets] are traversing through</p>
<p>One’s zodiac sign at the time when the sun is rising,</p>
<p>One is said to be born</p>
<p>Under the influence of these [planets].{24.76}</p>
<p>“If one is born in the nakṣatras of</p>
<p>[The Virgo] part of the second Phalgunī,</p>
<p>Hastā, or the [Virgo part] of Citrā,</p>
<p>One may become a powerful thief.{24.77}</p>
<p>“One will lack restraint with regard to the wives of others.</p>
<p>One may also become a general of the army.</p>
<p>If this is indicated in one’s birth horoscope,</p>
<p>One will obtain a kingdom. {24.78}</p>
<p>“The house where these stars belong</p>
<p>Is the sign of Virgo.</p>
<p>Their dual regents are [the sun and the moon],</p>
<p>Or another planet, depending on the location.{24.79}</p>
<p>“The seniormost of these stars</p>
<p>Are guarded by either the cruel planet,</p>
<p>Or by the gentle planet,</p>
<p>Or by the ever joyful and auspicious lord.{24.80}</p>
<p>“If one is born in the afternoon</p>
<p>And one’s birth [nakṣatras]</p>
<p>Are those of Citrā, Svāti,</p>
<p>Or the greater part of Viśākhā,{24.81}</p>
<p>“Then the sign of Libra will bring much wealth.</p>
<p>For beings who are under the influence of the moon,</p>
<p>This is a terrible house.</p>
<p>It will not make them unfortunate, though, but grant wealth.{24.82}</p>
<p>“People who are born</p>
<p>Under the same influences</p>
<p>But at night, at the end of a watch,</p>
<p>Will always be fond of drinking.</p>
<p>They are discreet, respected for their modesty,</p>
<p>Honored, and venerated. {24.83}</p>
<p>“They may sometimes obtain a kingdom,</p>
<p>Sometimes pleasures, and sometimes wealth.</p>
<p>Unless determined by their horoscopes to be otherwise,</p>
<p>Women [born under this sign] will be childless.</p>
<p>If, however, their horoscopes are favorable,</p>
<p>They will give birth to many children with ease. {24.84}</p>
<p>“The [birth] influence of Anurādhā</p>
<p>Brings perfect fulfillment of activities.</p>
<p>One will have a loving nature, many friends,</p>
<p>And will always be valiant and daring. {24.85}</p>
<p>“It is said about Jyeṣṭhā that a person</p>
<p>Born into the world [under its influence] will be fierce.</p>
<p>He will experience and will have to put up with much suffering.</p>
<p>People born [in this nakṣatra tend to be] cruel. {24.86}</p>
<p>“The sign of Scorpio is described as</p>
<p>Always intense and impetuous.</p>
<p>I will now describe the types of birth</p>
<p>And the astrological influences particular to this sign. {24.87}</p>
<p>“If a person is born</p>
<p>When the sun ‘marks’ noon,</p>
<p>He will certainly become a fierce king</p>
<p>Who wins battles. {24.88}</p>
<p>“At such times, the planet in the form of a young boy</p>
<p>Will exercise its influence at the precise moment.</p>
<p>This planet is specified as Mars,</p>
<p>Who [shines] his light onto the goddess Earth.{24.89}</p>
<p>“Because of this, [such a king] rules the earth,</p>
<p>Protected by his own son.</p>
<p>If one’s position in life turns out to be different,</p>
<p>It will be a mixture of good and bad things.</p>
<p>One will, however, live long</p>
<p>And be energetic and intelligent. {24.90}</p>
<p>“One born in Anurādhā will possess</p>
<p>Great wisdom and loving friends.</p>
<p>This house belongs to Mars</p>
<p>And always has mixed planetary influences.</p>
<p>When the nakṣatra of Mūlā sets in,</p>
<p>Followed by the first Āṣāḍhā and {24.91}</p>
<p>“The [Sagittarius] part of the second Āṣāḍhā,</p>
<p>[These three] are proclaimed as the sign of Sagittarius.</p>

<p>Its horoscope is as follows: {24.92}</p>
<p>“When the sun ‘marks’ the afternoon,</p>
<p>Or when the moon ‘marks’ the second part of the night,</p>
<p>It is said that birth at this time</p>
<p>Will predestine one to obtain a kingdom. {24.93}</p>
<p>“[One born] at the onset [of Sagittarius] will destroy one’s family;</p>
<p>[Birth] at the end of it is said to be auspicious.</p>
<p>One born in the middle of it</p>
<p>Will obtain pleasures, there is no doubt. {24.94}</p>
<p>“When one’s youth has passed,</p>
<p>As illustrious as the orb of the sun,</p>
<p>One may become, in one’s old age,</p>
<p>A king rich in pleasures and wealth. {24.95}</p>
<p>“As a king, one would become powerful in the lowlands;</p>
<p>This would not be so in other places, so it is told.</p>
<p>But there also other people of different types</p>
<p>For whom these influences are reversed. {24.96}</p>
<p>“[The next nakṣatras] are said to be</p>
<p>The second Āṣāḍhā, the Śravaṇā,</p>

<p>“This sign is the house of Saturn</p>
<p>But is influenced also by other planets.</p>
<p>The following horoscope applies on earth</p>
<p>Always to the just mentioned nakṣatras: {24.98}</p>
<p>“Those born when night has set in,</p>
<p>Either at the end of the first or during the middle watch,</p>
<p>Are observed to enjoy</p>
<p>Great pleasures in all respects. {24.99}</p>
<p>“Whether born in high or low families,</p>
<p>They become rulers over the earth.</p>

<p>Surrounded by water. {24.101}</p>
<p>“They may live long lives but have no offspring.</p>
<p>Others, for whom the influences are reversed,</p>
<p>May experience a lot of suffering.</p>

<p>“The nakṣatras of Dhaniṣṭhā, Śatabhiṣā,</p>

<p>Various pleasures on earth. {24.106}</p>
<p>“Others, whose horoscopes are unfavorable,</p>
<p>Will be afflicted by poverty and disease.</p>

<p>“The sign of Pisces starts</p>
<p>In the [latter] part of the first Bhadrapadā.</p>

<p>Universally to the [nakṣatras of Pisces]: {24.108}</p>
<p>“If one is born at night during the middle watch,</p>
<p>Or during the day when the risen sun</p>

<p>A little behind the midday point, {24.109}</p>
<p>“Or when it is a short distance from setting,</p>
<p>With [about] one cubit left to go,</p>

<p>“The gods from the realm of Brahmā know</p>
<p>This sign to be the house of Venus.</p>

<p>And steadfastly loyal to their friends. {24.112}</p>
<p>“If they live in the lowlands,</p>
<p>They will enjoy long life and great pleasures.</p>

<p>The abode of fish is in water. {24.114}</p>
<p>“Birth under these nakṣatras</p>

<p>And then again after it completely disappears,</p>
<p>Or in the afternoon, at the end of the meridian hour,{24.158}</p>
<p>“The beings of the animal realm</p>

<p>Causing [landslides with] falling boulders. {24.160}</p>
<p>“If the earth shakes</p>
<p>Later during the same watch,</p>
<p>When this sign is observed</p>
<p>A great, rain-filled hurricane will come. {24.161}</p>
<p>“If there is a terrifying earthquake</p>
<p>At the end of the [first] watch,</p>
<p>It should be known that a hostile army</p>
<p>Of the western king will invade. {24.162}</p>
<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second watch,</p>
<p>There will be death, disease, invasions by foreign armies,</p>
<p>And severe stomach disorders. {24.163}</p>
<p>“Afflicted by the disorders of bile and phlegm,</p>

<p>From one place to another. {24.164}</p>
<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>Halfway through the second watch,</p>

<p>Breaking trees and destroying temples {24.165}</p>
<p>“And the tall mountain ridges and peaks.</p>
<p>There is no doubt.</p>
<p>It will destroy the nice monastery buildings</p>

<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>At midnight,</p>
<p>The chief and most eminent king</p>
<p>In the eastern countries will die—</p>
<p>Either the king himself or his son.</p>
<p>Such an earthquake also portends famine. {24.167}</p>
<p>“An earthquake that occurs all over the earth</p>
<p>In the last watch of the night,</p>

<p>Portends peace and freedom from disease. {24.168}</p>
<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight,</p>
<p>The kings of the swampy central regions</p>
<p>Will be afflicted with disease.</p>
<p>They will die in terrible pain,</p>
<p>Fighting one another. {24.169}</p>
<p>“If the earth shakes during the third watch,</p>
<p>This portends the well-being of children.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes, wasps, and stinging insects,</p>

<p>“An earthquake that occurs before dawn</p>

<p>In the cities everywhere. {24.171}</p>
<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>When the sun is rising,</p>
<p>All central regions</p>
<p>Will be infested with bandits.</p>
<p>After seven days</p>
<p>The king will die. {24.172}</p>
<p>“Whenever and wherever an earthquake</p>
<p>Manifests with great force,</p>
<p>At that time and place</p>
<p>Good and bad behavior will manifest. {24.173}</p>
<p>“If an earthquake occurs</p>
<p>At the same time as a meteorite bursts,</p>
<p>The white light of the meteorite</p>
<p>Will destroy anything that is crooked or dishonest.{24.174}</p>
<p>“Thus, white meteorites are always</p>
<p>Auspicious and bring what is good.</p>
<p>Red ones are very frightening,</p>
<p>As they portend conflagrations. {24.175}</p>
<p>“Smoke-colored or black ones</p>
<p>Portend the death of the king.</p>
<p>Yellow ones, brown ones,</p>
<p>Or those of mixed color {24.176}</p>
<p>“Portend the rise in activities</p>
<p>Of mixed character.</p>
<p>This will happen in the place indicated</p>
<p>By the bursting meteorite. {24.177}</p>
<p>“If it [bursts] in the center [of the sky],</p>
<p>The central regions are indicated.</p>
<p>If the sound produced thereby is pleasant,</p>
<p>This indicates prosperity and freedom from disease. {24.178}</p>
<p>“A terrible sound will bring unpleasant things to the world,</p>
<p>Whereas a sound like a drum will bring what is good.</p>
<p>A sound that is frightening or terrifying</p>
<p>Indicates famine. {24.179}</p>
<p>“Such are always the applications</p>
<p>Of planetary forecasts whenever they occur.</p>
<p>One should perform rites for success</p>
<p>Whenever the nakṣatras are auspicious. {24.180}</p>
<p>“The nakṣatras of Aśvinī, Bharaṇī,</p>
<p>Puṣya, both Bhadrapadās,</p>
<p>Revatī, and Anurādhā</p>
<p>Are excellent for mantra recitation sessions.</p>
<p>In these nakṣatras, the mantras</p>
<p>Will be accomplished and will fulfill one’s goal. {24.181}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala should be drawn</p>
<p>In the same nakṣatras with [the same] stars,</p>
<p>When the chief planets of the days of the week</p>
<p>Glow either yellow or white. {24.182}</p>
<p>“Also, the lunar day should be auspicious,</p>
<p>Such as the fifteenth—that is, the day of the full moon.</p>
<p>[On that day] one should not travel abroad,</p>
<p>But one may draw the maṇḍala. {24.183}</p>
<p>“The kings should plan their journeys</p>
<p>For either the first, the third,</p>
<p>The fifth, the tenth, the seventh,</p>
<p>Or the thirteenth lunar day.</p>
<p>Going on a journey on these days is excellent</p>
<p>And brings good fortune to all the people. {24.184}</p>
<p>“[On these days], one should not draw the maṇḍala</p>
<p>Of any mantra [deities] in the mantra system.</p>
<p>The mantras will not succeed on these [days],</p>
<p>And are taught to be the cause of obstacles.{24.185}</p>
<p>“A pilgrimage for the sake of homa will be successful</p>
<p>When the best planets are joined with the lunar days;</p>
<p>Jupiter, Venus, Moon, and Mercury</p>
<p>Are superior in all rites. {24.186}</p>
<p>“These four planets are always the best</p>
<p>When dwelling in the [right] lunar day.</p>
<p>A pilgrimage made [at that time]</p>
<p>Here on earth will be successful. {24.187}</p>
<p>“One should opt for the days</p>
<p>That are free from ill omens—</p>
<p>The days that are free</p>
<p>From [the danger of] swift destruction.{24.188}</p>
<p>“During that period, one should</p>
<p>Choose only the following twelve muhūrtas:</p>

<p>“Many of the muhūrtas, which are known to be thirty,</p>
<p>Are said to be auspicious.</p>
<p>If rain falls on the tenth lunar day,</p>
<p>Or the fourteenth, at night,{24.192}</p>
<p>“During the dark fortnight, at night,</p>
<p>One should engage in quick counting,</p>

<p>“On these [days], Vināyaka</p>
<p>In its four emanations will create obstacles.</p>

<p>Four muhūrtas make one prahara. {24.199}</p>
<p>“One should observe these time measures</p>
<p>At the three junctions of the day,</p>

<p>“Fifteen such days are proclaimed</p>
<p>To be one fortnight.</p>
<p>Two fortnights are one month—</p>

<p>Tormented by grief and tribulations of different kinds.</p>
<p>He will perish along with</p>
<p>His wives and sons.{24.232}</p>
<p>“If the nakṣatras, during which the earthquake occurs,</p>
<p>Can be described as hazy,</p>
<p>Then within five days</p>
<p>All the directions will become filled with smoke.</p>
<p>Without any rain, it will be terrible.</p>
<p>This will continue for many days without interruption. {24.233}</p>
<p>“People within the range of vision</p>
<p>Will not see one another.</p>
<p>Human vision will not penetrate there</p>
<p>To see one another. {24.234}</p>
<p>“There will be great dangers there</p>
<p>That will destroy kings and states</p>
<p>That have the karma for this.</p>
<p>There will be shooting stars all around, {24.235}</p>
<p>“With terrible double or triple</p>
<p>Circles around them.</p>
<p>If rainbows appear at night</p>
<p>And the wings of crows appear white; {24.236}</p>
<p>“If the color white appears as black</p>
<p>And black as white;</p>
<p>If the colors of birds and their cries,</p>
<p>Particular to the season, are altered; {24.237}</p>
<p>“And if the birds are acting out of character,</p>
<p>Wherever this occurs, there will be great dangers there.</p>
<p>Also, if the two-legged, four-legged,</p>
<p>Legless, and multi-legged beings act out of character, {24.238}</p>
<p>“And if the birds and other animals behave in strange ways,</p>
<p>This indicates great danger.</p>
<p>If dogs with distended bellies</p>
<p>Keep howling again and again,</p>
<p>Whether at daytime or nighttime,</p>
<p>This indicates great danger. {24.239}</p>
<p>“In places where many such omens</p>
<p>Occur in profusion,</p>
<p>There will be a drought</p>
<p>And the king will lose his royal wheel. {24.240}</p>
<p>“Whatever the birth horoscope of sentient beings,</p>
<p>With its good and bad influences, is said to be,</p>
<p>The corresponding omens will occur,</p>
<p>Bringing, in this life, good and bad results. {24.241}</p>
<p>“Otherwise, if there is no previous cause,</p>
<p>No signs will be perceived.</p>
<p>Obstacles never happen without a cause,</p>
<p>And they arise according to omens.” {24.242}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed twenty-fourth chapter, on the astrological knowledge of signs, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni once again addressed the planets, the nakṣatras, the stars, and other celestial bodies: {25.1}</p>
<p>“Please listen, all of you, venerable sirs, the planets and the nakṣatras! This sovereign manual of the divine youth Mañjuśrī, which contains ritual instructions on the empowerment and the maṇḍala according to the mantra system, should not be transgressed against. You honored celestial bodies should not obstruct the knowledge holders trained in this supreme manual who engage in the practice of recitation, homa, the observance of rules, and magic.  Nor should you hinder the insights gained by the calculations of the behavior (carita) of the asterisms and nakṣatras. Instead, you and the hosts of gods should all protect those who engage in the instructions thereof. All the wicked beings should be warded off, restrained, and properly instructed. None of them should be hurt in any way. [Instead,] they should be established in the stages of this doctrine that confers the ten powers.” {25.2}</p>
<p>Lord Śākyamuni then entered the samādhi called the erect uṣṇīṣa of all the tathāgatas in order to keep away all evildoers from every sentient being. As soon as the blessed Śākyamuni entered this samādhi, all the tathāgatas dwelling in the world spheres in the ten directions clearly saw the blessed Tathāgata Śākyamuni in the realm of the Pure Abode and came over to him. They approached with their inconceivable buddha mien, and spoke to the blessed Tathāgata Śākyamuni as follows: {25.3}</p>
<p>“For the good of beings,</p>
<p>Please teach, O great hero,</p>
<p>The single syllable that can be used instead of any mantra;</p>
<p>Teach it along with its instructions as prescribed. {25.4}</p>
<p>“This vidyārāja of great magical power</p>
<p>Was taught by all the buddhas.</p>
<p>This single syllable is the best mantra</p>
<p>For the time of destruction during the lowest eon. {25.5}</p>
<p>“It was taught by all the buddhas</p>
<p>As the best of all mantras,</p>
<p>The Uṣṇīṣarāja, the great hero</p>
<p>Who wards off all spirits. {25.6}</p>
<p>“It restrains grahas, nakṣatras,</p>
<p>The evil minded mātṛs,</p>
<p>All the obstacle makers,</p>
<p>And whatever other evil beings there are in this world. {25.7}</p>
<p>“He, the cakravartin of great power,</p>
<p>Who confers benefits and happiness</p>
<p>On the beings who recite him,</p>
<p>Is the most important [mantra] in this entire teaching {25.8}</p>
<p>“He is Uṣṇīṣarāja of great valor,</p>
<p>The supreme lord of everything.</p>
<p>Teach him to us, O Tathāgata,</p>
<p>If the time is now right for this.” {25.9}</p>
<p>Having said this, the buddhas</p>
<p>Fell silent and waited. {25.10}</p>
<p>At that time, the entire congregation of the buddhas and all the world spheres within the great trichiliocosm, with all the living beings and inanimate objects there, became bathed in the same light. Through the Buddha’s blessing, not a single being suffered pain, and a great light could be seen. {25.11}</p>
<p>The blessed Śākyamuni, looking at the entire realm of the Pure Abode, the bodhisattva great beings there, the gods, all the śrāvakas, the pratyeka­buddhas, and the blessed buddhas congregated in this great gathering, then said: {25.12}</p>
<p>“Pay attention, O blessed buddhas and all the pratyeka­buddhas and noble śrāvakas, to this teaching on the ritual of this vidyā cakravartin, the one syllable who resides above the uṣṇīṣas of all the tathāgatas. He is Uṣṇīṣarāja, the blessed cakravartin, the perfect teacher of infinite power and valor. I will teach his ritual again now, during the lowest eon. I will now, at this time in the lowest eon, say again the mantra of that blessed teacher of the triple universe whose instructions are difficult to find, who is honored by all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, and who fulfills the goal of every activity.{25.13}</p>
<p>“At the time when the Buddha’s teaching disappears, he—the universal blessed cakravartin Uṣṇīṣa—becomes the preserver of the teaching. He bestows accomplishments. He, a blessed buddha, fulfills the interests of beings during the entire time when the teachings of all the buddhas have disappeared. He, the blessed one, is the preserver in whom the entire Dharma basket of all the tathāgatas is condensed. O venerable hosts of gods and all beings! Please listen! {25.14}</p>
<p>“Bhrūṁ.</p>
<p>“This syllable is the blessed, all-knowing lord</p>
<p>Cast by the buddhas into the form of a mantra.</p>
<p>He extends himself to all embodied beings</p>
<p>As a most compassionate teacher. {25.15}</p>
<p>“He is the glorious lord of mantras,</p>
<p>Honored and celebrated as Uṣṇīṣa.</p>
<p>A receptacle of compassion,</p>
<p>He is merged into and abides as this very syllable.</p>
<p>Emanating as the sphere of phenomena,</p>
<p>He abides as all forms. {25.16}</p>
<p>“As the bodies of the buddhas</p>
<p>Remain for people in the form of relics,</p>
<p>They are worshiped in their material form.</p>
<p>The immaterial relics, in particular, {25.17}</p>
<p>“Are those of the true Dharma</p>
<p>Taught for the sake of people.</p>
<p>The material relics, said to be the bodily remains</p>
<p>Of the lordly victors, possess great power.{25.18}</p>
<p>“The moon-like sages, who are free from karmic influences,</p>
<p>Described different types of relics</p>
<p>That issue forth, for the benefit of beings,</p>
<p>In either material or immaterial form. {25.19}</p>
<p>“Inseparably infused, out of compassion for beings,</p>
<p>With the sphere of phenomena,</p>
<p>The sun-like lord of the world</p>
<p>Abides in the form of the mantra. {25.20}</p>
<p>“On earth, he is perceived</p>
<p>As omnifarious and omniscient.</p>
<p>He is the mantra that fulfills all purposes</p>
<p>And has been taught by all the buddhas. {25.21}</p>
<p>“This condensed mantra should be recited</p>
<p>By oneself according to the instructions.</p>
<p>It will accomplish all activities</p>
<p>And always bring the desired results. {25.22}</p>
<p>“Its ritual, in its condensed form,</p>
<p>Will be taught again at another time,</p>
<p>At the end of the eon, when the best of sages,</p>
<p>The Tathāgata, has departed.</p>
<p>It is said that the ritual and the mantra</p>
<p>Will both be accomplished at that time. {25.23}</p>
<p>“Now, the ritual of One Syllable, previously taught at length, will be taught in brief—the ritual of the blessed cakravartin, the tathāgata-uṣṇīṣa who frustrates the activities employed by one’s enemies and conquers the unconquerable ones, the lord of all mantras who is respected by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, Uṣṇīṣa the cakravartin. {25.24}</p>
<p>“Right from the beginning, in whatever place he is recited, all the evil grahas within the radius of one league will flee; no other mantra, even though it may have been accomplished, is more powerful, and all the gods will depart the vicinity for some other place. He can take away the accomplishments of other practitioners, whether worldly or supramundane, if this were the wish of the practitioner. He can break, destroy, and nail down the mantras employed by others. {25.25}</p>
<p>“If one wishes to break a vidyā of others, one should grasp a handful of green kuśa grass, incant it [with the Uṣṇīṣarāja] one hundred and eight times, and, targeting the vidyā, cut the grass with a weapon. The vidyā will be broken. If one makes an effigy with the same and nails it through the heart, the vidyā will be nailed. If one makes a knot on a safflower-red thread incanted seven times, the vidyā will be bound. If one encloses [the effigy] within an earthenware vessel incanted one hundred and eight times, the vidyā will be arrested. If one slices [the effigy] in two with a weapon through the heart, the vidyā will be broken. If one paints [the effigy], using brown mustard stained red with poison and blood, the vidyā will be chastised. If one strikes [the effigy] with a vine of oleander, the vidyā will be afflicted with pain. One can thus assail any vidyā at will in any way whatever. {25.26}</p>
<p>“Apart from the rites just mentioned, if one performs a homa having bathed in milk, one will attain peace. By offering a homa of ghee, one will bring peace and prosperity to everyone. By making one’s hand into a fist, one can block all mantras. One can then unblock them mentally. If one wants to accomplish a mantra, one can gain mastery of it by first blocking it with the [Uṣṇīṣarāja]. If one wants to accomplish another rite, one can do this with the same [Uṣṇīṣarāja]. With this mantra alone one can summon a deity  and also dismiss it. One for whom a protection rite is performed with this mantra will become invincible. {25.27}</p>
<p>“If any mantra does not produce the intended result or carry out the order, it should be recited together with the [Uṣṇīṣarāja]. It will then produce results or fulfill the command. If it does not produce the result or carry out the order, it will die.{25.28}</p>
<p>“One should offer into the fire sesame seeds smeared with curds, honey, and ghee one hundred and eight times, three times a day, for seven days. Then, whatever [deity] mantra one pronounces, that [deity] will come under one’s control. It will carry out whatever task is mentioned and fulfill any command. {25.29}</p>
<p>“If one wishes to enthrall gods, one should offer cedar sticks one thousand and eight times—one will enthrall them within seven nights. If it is nāgas that one wants to enthrall, one should offer into the fire the three sweet substances—the nāgas will become enthralled. If one wants to enthrall yakṣas, one should offer a dish made of curds— they will become enthralled. One should [also] offer a curd dish if one wants to enthrall a yakṣiṇī. One will enthrall gandharvas with [a homa of] ‘all fragrances,’ or with [a homa of] sticks or flowers of the aśoka or the beautyberry tree. {25.30}</p>
<p>“To enthrall yakṣiṇīs, nāgas, nāginīs, or grahas, one should use brown mustard. One can enthrall a king with a homa of white mustard; a brahmin, with a homa of flowers; a vaiśya, with a homa of curds, milk, and ghee; a śūdra, with a homa of chaff dust; a woman, with a homa of salt; a harlot, with a homa of beans or jambul; and a virgin, with a homa of parched rice. One can enthrall anyone, in any place, with a homa of ghee and sesame oil offered at the three junctions of the day for seven days.”</p>
<p>Having said this, the supreme Victor remained silent. {25.31}</p>
<p>The eminent seventh sage</p>
<p>Addressed this to the hosts of gods.</p>
<p>Smiling, familiar with worldly matters, liberated,</p>
<p>With his mind fully controlled,{25.32}</p>
<p>The supreme sage then spoke this</p>
<p>To Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>The senior son of the buddhas,</p>
<p>A bodhisattva of great power: {25.33}</p>
<p>“I now have taught the extensive</p>
<p>Ritual of the wheel holder—</p>
<p>The integrated ritual</p>
<p>Of the sagacious lord, the god of gods. {25.34}</p>
<p>“The extent of his rites cannot be expressed</p>
<p>Even by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>I will teach them further in brief</p>
<p>To increase the welfare of human beings.” {25.35}</p>
<p>When this was said,</p>
<p>The glorious Mañjughoṣa of great power</p>
<p>Supplicated the Buddha, who was staying</p>
<p>Above the realm of the Pure Abode: {25.36}</p>
<p>“Please teach! Please do, O most courageous one!</p>
<p>You are the perfect buddha, the supreme human being!</p>
<p>Teach to bring happiness to humans</p>
<p>At the time of destruction at the end of the eon! {25.37}</p>
<p>“What is the most powerful mantra king</p>
<p>Of that great hero like?</p>
<p>How can the accomplishment of the painting be observed before long?</p>
<p>What is the painting procedure?” {25.38}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed twenty-fifth chapter, on the benefits arising from the cakravartin One Syllable, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>At that time Blessed Śākyamuni, looking again at the realm of the Pure Abode, addressed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, to my short teaching on the painting procedure of One Syllable—the cakravartin of great power. This procedure was previously taught at length, but now only briefly.{26.1}</p>
<p>“During this lowest eon beings have little diligence or wisdom, and are rather dull. They would be unable to successfully execute the painting in its extensive version.{26.2}</p>
<p>“Out of my desire to benefit beings</p>
<p>I will teach it in a condensed form,</p>
<p>So that the reciters [of One Syllable]</p>
<p>Accomplish the supreme goal. {26.3}</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform the supreme sādhana, one should paint the Blessed One on an undamaged cloth with untrimmed fringes, shorn to remove loose fibers, using uncontaminated paints. [The Blessed One,] the Dharma king who turns the wheels of Dharma, the supreme lord of all worlds, the best of humans, the most eminent among two-legged beings,  the jewel of a tathāgata, the supreme victor by the name Ratnaketu should be depicted teaching the Dharma with a halo of light surrounding him. {26.4}</p>
<p>“Below [Ratnaketu] are Brahmā and Vajrapāṇi, and above, holding garlands, two gods. Below there is the practitioner. One should recite [One Syllable] in front of the painting at the three junctions of the day while burning agalloch incense, until one has completed one million repetitions. Afterward one may perform the following rites. {26.5}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the wheel.</p>
<p>“First, if one wants to perform this sādhana, one should construct a twelve-spoked wheel out of ‘flower-metal’ and, during the prātihāra bright fortnight, recite the mantra one million times before the Blessed One, while burning an incense of agalloch, at the three junctions of the day. At the final stage during the full moon, one should prepare many offerings and, holding them up in one’s hands, recite the mantra until the wheel blazes with light. By grasping it, one will become a monarch of vidyādharas. One will fly through space together with those of them who see him, or whom he himself sees. {26.6}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the parasol.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should commission a new, white, bright parasol marked with a golden wheel and adorned with hanging [strips of] silk. According to procedure, one should place the parasol above one’s head and recite the mantra. The vidyā will attend upon one of her own accord. One should recite the mantra in this manner one million times before the Blessed One, at the three junctions of the day, while burning agalloch incense. At the final stage during the full moon, one should prepare many offerings and, holding them up in one’s hands, recite the mantra until [the parasol] blazes with light. When taking hold of it, one will become a monarch of vidyādharas. Doing this during the full moon every month, one will succeed within five fortnights, during the prātihāra fortnight. Once this practice is accomplished, all phenomena will become apparent. One will attain all the [five] superknowledges. One will become a siddha praised by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and one will be able to adapt to every being. In the next world, too, one will become a monarch with a retinue of thousands. {26.7}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of Uṣṇīṣa.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make a stick, one cubit long, out of gold, silver, copper, or precious stone. One should then recite the mantra until [the stick] emits light. When one takes hold of it, one will be able to go wherever one pleases and teach Dharma to sentient beings. One will live one great eon. {26.8}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the auspicious pot.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make a pot out of gold; fill it completely with all types of seeds, jewels, and herbs; cover it with white cloth; and imbue it with magical power by means of the same [mantra]. If one starts in a prātihāra bright fortnight, one will accomplish the sādhana in the next prātihāra fortnight. If one places this pot in one’s hand, one will obtain whatever one wishes for. [The wealth] will be inexhaustible. {26.9}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the wish-fulfilling gem.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should fashion a jewel out of precious gems, crystal, or gold, with a golden handle, and attach to it [strips of] cloth. By this method one will succeed. One will accomplish anything one can think of. By taking hold of it, one will be free of impediments and will surpass in power gods and men. If one recites the mantra of the blessed [One Syllable] ten million times, one will be able to levitate. One will obtain the body of a god and will live for many great eons. {26.10}</p>
<p>“There are also other chief [uṣṇīṣa kings], starting with Sitātapatra. By incanting [the wish-fulfilling gem] one million times with the mantra of this blessed lord, one will succeed in all the tasks that need to be performed. This inviolable tathāgata-uṣṇīṣa will thus accomplish, before long, whatever he is employed at, even if it involves the rites of other [religions].</p>
<p>“Similarly, one will be able to accomplish anything with one million repetitions of the mantra of the blessed uṣṇīṣa [king] Cakravartin, the lord of all the vidyā mantras. {26.11}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the vajra.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make  a one-pointed vajra from red sandalwood or ‘flower-metal’ and wipe it with the five products of the cow. Then, on the fifteenth day of the bright fortnight, one should lay out before the painting many offerings, light butter lamps, and rinse the vajra with scented water. One will thus enthrall the yakṣas.{26.12}</p>
<p>“Commending oneself to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, one should perform the protection rite for oneself and also for one’s assistants within the confines of the maṇḍala, using the mantra of Uṣṇīṣarāja with his retinue, or of Tejorāśi or Sitātapatra. One should take the vajra with one’s right hand and, starting when the first watch of the night has passed and the second set in, recite the mantra with a one-pointed mind until the vajra emits light. As the result, all the vidyādharas, gods, nāgas, and yakṣas will arrive together. All the vidyādhara kings will arrive too. Praised by them, one will ascend to the abode of vidyādharas and will become their emperor. With the body like that of Vajrapāṇi and a power equal to his, one will be able to ascend, within an instant or a brief moment, to the realm of the Akaniṣṭha gods. Remaining [there] for one great eon, one will behold the noble Lord Maitreya and hear the Dharma. After death, one will be born wherever one wishes to. If so wishing, one will arrive in the presence of Vajrapāṇi. {26.13}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the sword.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should take a sword without any defect and, having fasted for one day and one night, offer worship with many offerings to the Blessed One. One should recite the mantra until the sword blazes with light. Having accomplished that, one will fly through space with one’s retinue. With curly hair and the form of a sixteen-year-old, never discommoding—or discommoded by—any vidyādhara, one will live among them for one intermediate eon. {26.14}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of red arsenic.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should purchase some red arsenic in an honorable transaction, fast  for three nights when the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya, offer food to the members of the saṅgha, and request their permission. When this has been granted, one should commence the sādhana. One should give many offerings and light one thousand butter lamps. Having fasted for three nights while giving rise to loving kindness for all beings and commending oneself to the buddhas, one should take hold of the arsenic and recite the mantra until one has attained the threefold accomplishment, namely that the arsenic emits heat, smoke, and flames. Whatever one has previously thought of will be accomplished.{26.15}</p>
<p>“If, without losing this accomplishment, one places a bindi on one’s forehead while the arsenic is emitting heat, all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, bhūtas, piśācas, and so forth, and all the beings dwelling in Jambūdvīpa, will become one’s servants attentive to orders. One will live one thousand years. {26.16}</p>
<p>“If one places the bindi while the arsenic is emitting smoke, one will become invisible. If one wants, one will be invisible even to gods. One can reappear and again disappear in a single instant. One will become the king of all invisible beings and will live for three thousand years. {26.17}</p>
<p>“[If one places the bindi while the arsenic] is emitting flames, one will become a vidyādhara and will be able to fly surrounded by a retinue. One will become the king of vidyādharas. One will obtain the body of a celestial youth that can’t be harmed even by gods, let alone vidyādharas. One will live for an eon, and when one dies, one will be reborn among the Tuṣita gods. {26.18}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the trident.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make a trident from ‘flower-metal’ and recite the mantra for one year. One should then build from sand a caitya the size of one cubit and worship it with many offerings, including a large bali. Holding the trident in one’s right hand, one should recite the mantra while sitting in a cross-legged posture  until the trident starts sparkling, emitting thousands of light rays. Subsequently the gods will arrive, headed by Maheśvara. All the vidyādharas will rain flowers. Then, surrounded by them, one will fly up together with all those whom one sees and those that see oneself. Having three eyes, one will become like a second Maheśvara, will be saluted by all the vidyādharas, and will live for one great eon. One will destroy evil-minded beings merely by looking at them. No one in the world will be able to harm one, not even in the realm of gods, let alone among the vidyādharas. When one dies, one will be reborn in Sukhāvatī. {26.19}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the vetāla.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should procure an uninjured human corpse, secure its chest with four stakes of khadira wood and, sitting on it, offer into the fire powdered jewels. A wish fulfilling gem will then appear at the tip of the corpse’s tongue. If one seizes it, one will become a monarch of the vidyādharas. Whatever weapons one thinks of, they will materialize by the power of mind alone. One will radiate light for a distance of one hundred leagues and will be able to choose the time of one’s death and to go wherever one pleases. Also, in another world, one will be a monarch of the vidyādharas. When one dies, one will be reborn in the Vimala world. {26.20}</p>
<p>“The second sādhana of the vetāla.</p>
<p>“One should procure an uninjured corpse, nail it down with stakes of jujube wood, and offer into its mouth a homa of iron filings. The corpse’s tongue will move out. If one cuts it off, one will fly up surrounded by a retinue of one hundred. One will live for one intermediate eon,  playing and enjoying oneself on the top of Mount Sumeru. After death, one will become a king of a province. {26.21}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the goad.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make a goad out of kuśa grass, rinse it with the five products of a cow, and fast for one night. The handle of the goad should be one cubit long. One should make bountiful offerings to Vajrapāṇi and light one hundred butter lamps. One should also make a vajra. In this way one will be protected by Sitātapatra. Tejorāśi should be employed in creating the maṇḍala enclosure on the ground. One should incant the stakes seven times and drive them into the ground on the four sides. Then one should secure the location and build a fence. {26.22}</p>
<p>“Then, during the second watch, one should sit cross-legged and, with a focused mind, offer perfume, flowers, and incense to the goad—this is the rite of protection. Having bowed to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, one should take the goad into one’s hand and recite the mantra until, as the result, the pain of the hell beings and the gods is pacified. If one then bows to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, one will fly up as a king of vidyādharas with a goad in one’s hand and without being obstructed. All the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and so forth, seeing one from afar, will bow. One will remain in this condition for one eon, and when one dies, one will be reborn in the Vajra realm. One will behold Vajrapāṇi there.{26.23}</p>
<p>“If one uses the painting as the object of the sādhana, one will become a vidyādhara once the painting emits light. Whatever rite one wants to accomplish, one should recite the mantra of this rite one hundred thousand times, including in the mantra the target’s name. In the end, after one night’s fast, one should offer a large pūjā, light a fire with sticks of the crown flower plant, and offer into it one thousand and eight oblations of sesame seeds smeared with curds, honey, and ghee.  At the end of the homa, [the target] will arrive and give whatever wealth one may desire. He will remain enthralled and attentive to orders. {26.24}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of Maheśvara.</p>
<p>“If one wants to enthrall Maheśvara, one should worship him in his benevolent (dakṣiṇa) form with bountiful offerings. One should light a fire with sticks of the crown flower plant and offer into it one thousand and eight homas. The sound ‘ha ha’ will be heard; one should not be afraid. Maheśvara will arrive and ask, ‘What should I do?’ One should reply, ‘May all the vidyās of Maheśvara be accomplished by me.’ Maheśvara will grant whatever boon one may wish for. Saying, ‘May it be so,’ he will disappear. {26.25}</p>
<p>“Similarly, one can summon Viṣṇu, Brahmā, and so forth. Whatever boon one wishes for, one should perform the rite accordingly. This should be done by someone who has performed the protection rite. {26.26}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the yakṣiṇī.</p>
<p>“If one wants to summon a yakṣiṇī, one should offer, while saying her name, oblations of aśoka flowers for seven days. She will arrive and grant a boon. She will certainly arrive on the seventh day. According to one’s wish, she will become one’s mother, sister, or wife. If she subsequently fails to arrive, her head will split. If one wants to summon a nāginī instead, one should follow exactly the same procedure, but use, [instead of aśoka], flowers of cobra’s saffron.{26.27}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the yakṣa.</p>
<p>“If one wants to summon a yakṣa, one should offer a homa of curds and cooked rice for three months. At the end of this period, one should fast for one night and then offer a large pūjā to the Blessed One, and also make a bali offering of rice porridge to the yakṣas. In one’s mind, one should resolve, ‘I am going to summon the yakṣas,’ and offer into the fire one thousand and eight sticks of the banyan tree smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. Subsequently, the yakṣas, including Kubera, will arrive. {26.28}</p>
<p>“One should welcome them with an offering of red flowers. They will say, ‘What can we do for you?’ and should be told in reply,  ‘Send me a different yakṣa every single day who will carry out my orders.’ They will then provide the yakṣas, one at a time. One should issue orders to them. They can procure a woman, even if she is one hundred leagues away. In the morning, they will take her back to the place where she belongs. They will provide refreshments also for one’s retinue of one hundred. One can travel wherever one wants, mounted on the back [of a yakṣa]. One will be brought back [in the same manner]. They will give one an elixir of long life. They will do whatever they are commanded. {26.29}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of Vajrapāṇi.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should do the preliminary practice either four or seven times. One should then offer a complete worship with bountiful offerings during the prātihāra bright fortnight right until the full moon. When the full moon pūjā is thus completed, one should feed the monks and all those categorized as saṅgha. To propitiate the noble Vajradhara, one should offer another big pūjā and, when the first watch of the night has passed and the second has set in, one should sit in a cross-legged position and, focused one-pointedly, resolve in one’s mind, ‘I will now behold Vajradhara.’ One should then offer into the fire [oblations of] bdellium pills, the size of kernels of the jujube fruit, throughout one watch of the night. At that time the garlands and chaplets of the Blessed One will move, the earth will shake, and thunder will roll through the clouds. All the vidyādharas will rain flowers. While [all this is happening,] Blessed Vajrapāṇi will arrive surrounded by all the vidyās, headed by the most prominent [among them]; by the vidyādhara kings; and by all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, kinnaras, and bodhisattvas. {26.30}</p>
<p>“At that moment, the acute suffering of hell beings will cease. One should welcome Vajrapāṇi with scented water [for the feet], prostrate to him, and stand up. Vajradhara will then ask, ‘What boon shall I give you?’  One can obtain from the Blessed One whatever one wishes for—a universal supremacy over the vidyādharas, the ability to find and enter the passages leading into the subterranean paradises, a kingdom, or the ability to disappear at will. If one wishes, one may become a monarch of the vidyādharas with a vajra body similar to Vajrapāṇi’s. One may procure any article by merely thinking of it. One will remain for one great eon, and when one dies, one will be reborn in the Vajra realm. {26.31}</p>
<p>“In short, the same procedure may also be used for other vidyādharas. The rites that are found in the ritual lore of Vajrapāṇi or Avalokiteśvara, those that have been taught by the Blessed One, those found in the ritual lore of Brahmā or Maheśvara—in short, the sādhanas given previously—will succeed in all the mundane and supramundane rites. The great mantras, if they are not thus made effective, will not succeed. If, however, they are recited as part of this procedure, [the vidyādhara] will make his appearance within seven nights. If he does not, he will perish. If one recites the mantra before the gods headed by Maheśvara, [the vidyādhara] will make his appearance within seven nights. If he does not, his head will split into twenty-one parts. {26.32}</p>
<p>“[The sādhana of substances, etc.]</p>
<p>“Ghee, sweet flag, collyrium, sacrificial grass, a wooden staff, the sacred thread, yellow or red arsenic, and so forth can be magically empowered during a lunar or solar eclipse. If one wants to perform the sādhana of the substances, one should take some red arsenic, grind it with human milk, and prepare five pills. One should place them in a box containing agalloch and imbue them with power (sādhayet) during a lunar or solar eclipse by adding white mustard seeds. One should then offer a bali. When the mustard seeds make a hissing sound, the first accomplishment has been obtained.  With it, one can enthrall all people and accomplish all worldly aims. The [pills’ spirit] will do whatever it is ordered to. If the pills emit smoke, one will become the king of all those able to disappear at will and will live for one intermediate eon. If the pills emit light, one will obtain the youthful body of a god and the splendor of a newly risen sun. One will become the king of vidyārājas and will live for one great eon. This is the way to perform the sādhana of bezoar, yellow arsenic, and other substances. {26.33}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of collyrium.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should blend together antimony-based collyrium, blue lotuses, costus root, and sandalwood, and place the mixture in a copper vessel. Then, during a lunar eclipse, one should recite the mantra until the mixture emits smoke. One whose eyes are anointed with this preparation will become invisible. One will become the king of all those able to disappear at will, oneself being able to assume any form. {26.34}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the sword.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should take an undamaged sword, and lay out before the painting bountiful offerings during the eighth or the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight. One should offer bali according to procedure and, having performed the protection, should grasp the sword with the right hand and recite the mantra until the sword sparkles. If it does, one will become a sole vidyādhara. If, however, it flashes with light, one will become the king of all vidyādharas, with invincible power and valor, and will fly up together with all those whom one sees and those that see oneself. {26.35}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the vajra.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should make a vajra from ‘flower-metal,’ three-pointed at either end and sixteen fingers long, and wipe it with red sandalwood. Then, starting on the prātihāra bright fortnight, one should lay out before the painting many offerings and recite the mantra daily. One should also give food to the monks to nourish them. In the final stage, one should fast for three nights,  place the painting in a caitya containing relics, offer a large pūjā, and light one hundred butter lamps. Sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass, one should grasp the vajra with both hands and recite the mantra until the vajra emits light. When one holds this vajra, one will fly up surrounded by a retinue of seven and become the monarch of vidyādharas with power and valor equal to Vajrapāṇi’s. One will live for one great eon. At the time of physical demise, one will ascend to Vajrapāṇi’s realm. {26.36}</p>
<p>“Similarly, one can magically empower all weapons, such as spears, discuses, arrows, javelins, and so forth, as well as cloth shoes, wooden staffs, and sacred threads, following other procedures. For each of them the accomplishment is threefold. {26.37}</p>
<p>“The rite of pacifying a pestilence.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform the rite of pacifying, one should construct a lotus-shaped altar, light a fire using sticks suitable for sacrifice, and, using the small sacrificial ladle, offer one thousand and eight oblations of sweet rice pudding mixed with curds, honey, and ghee. Within three nights, the pestilence will be pacified for oneself or for one other person. Within seven nights, it will be pacified for the entire village or town. In the event of a pestilence with high mortality, one should offer oblations of sticks of the śamī tree smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. In the event of drought, one should offer oblations of sticks of the udumbara tree smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. If one offers the three sweet things, it will completely pacify any pestilence. In the event of famine, one should recite the mantra three million times.{26.38}</p>
<p>“[Rites for obtaining longevity.]</p>
<p>“On the night of the full moon of a prātihāra bright fortnight, during a lunar eclipse, having fasted for three nights, one should incant milk of a black cow one hundred and eight times and drink it, as it has now become an elixir of long life endowed with many qualities.</p>
<p>One should offer, over a period of ten nights, one thousand and eight oblations of panic grass sprouts smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. This will prevent untimely death and ensure long life. {26.39}</p>
<p>“Various rites.</p>
<p>“One should incant a banner, a conch, or another such item. The mere sight or  sound of it will paralyze an enemy army. One should prepare a new jar, completely filled with rice and scented water, and incant it one hundred and eight times. If one sprinkles with the contents someone attacked by vināyakas and then washes them, the person thus consecrated will acquire great fortune and will be free from all their nonvirtue. One can also perform maṇḍala rites and the rites [to control] grahas. {26.40}</p>
<p>“One can remove all poisons with a peacock’s feather incanted one hundred thousand times. Using the same feather, one can cure fever, pain in the eyes, and other diseases. Using [an incanted] thread, one can cure all fevers. By using the mantra in combination with the mudrā, one can smash the magical diagrams of the asuras.{26.41}</p>
<p>“If one descends to a river that flows toward the ocean and sets adrift one hundred thousand lotuses smeared with red sandalwood paste, one will obtain a treasure trove equal to the heap of lotuses that one has offered. When given away, the treasure will remain undiminished.</p>
<p>“If one offers one thousand and eight oblations of bilva fruit smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will obtain enjoyments.{26.42}</p>
<p>“Rites of enthrallment.</p>
<p>“If one wants to enthrall gods, one should offer one thousand and eight oblations of agalloch sticks smeared with curds, honey, and ghee at the three junctions of the day for twenty-one days. If one offers oblations of rice grains mixed with curds, honey, and ghee, one’s store of food will never diminish. {26.43}</p>
<p>“When enthralling yakṣas, one should offer oblations of bdellium pills smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. For yakṣiṇīs, one should use sticks of the aśoka tree; for nāgas, flowers of cobra’s saffron. For the noble Vajrapāṇi, one should use agalloch sticks; for vidyādharas, damanaka twigs; for gandharvas, sticks of agalloch smeared with olibanum oil. To enthrall pretas, one should offer oblations of frankincense; for kinnaras, oblations of pine resin;  for vināyakas, oblations of sarja resin. For each of these classes of beings one should offer one hundred and eight oblations for seven days.</p>
<p>“To enthrall a king, one should offer, at the three junctions of the day for seven days, one hundred and eight oblations of ‘royal’ mustard seeds smeared with sesame oil.</p>
<p>“If one recites the mantra 100,000 times while facing the sun, one will be free from all one’s nonvirtue. {26.44}</p>
<p>“Propitiation of vidyās.</p>
<p>“One desiring to propitiate any vidyā should fashion, while living on a diet of barley and cow urine, an effigy of her out of an uśīra root. One should worship it with white flowers, offer one hundred and eight oblations of milk, wash the effigy in milk, and offer incense of agalloch incanted one hundred and eight times. The vidyā goddess will be propitiated. With a single utterance of her vidyā, one’s own protection will be effected; with a double utterance, the protection of other beings; with a triple utterance, the protection of substances. {26.45}</p>
<p>“One desiring to help a vidyā [goddess] who has been broken, crushed, and destroyed by being nailed down with stakes should fashion her effigy out of uśīra root and worship it with white flowers. One should then offer, before the painting of the same Uṣṇīṣarāja, one thousand and eight oblations of ‘royal’ mustard smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. As for the vidyā, she will be freed from the stakes. {26.46}</p>
<p>“If one knows that the vidyā [formula] has been corrupted by bad people, one should write it on birchbark with bezoar [ink] and incant it one hundred and eight times with one’s own mantra. Then, one should offer a large pūjā to the Blessed One and recite [the vidyā] together with the Blessed One one thousand and eight times. If one goes to sleep right at the place of recitation on a bed of kuśa grass, the vidyā goddess will arrive in one’s dream and tell the missing or superfluous [parts of the vidyā formula].{26.47}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the lotus.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform this sādhana, one should fashion a lotus flower out of red sandalwood and offer a large pūjā. After three nights’ fast, one should take the flower with one’s right hand and recite the mantra until the flower emits light. One will then fly up surrounded by a retinue of twenty and become a monarch of vidyādharas.  One’s movement will not be obstructed. When one dies, one will ascend to Sukhāvatī. {26.48}</p>
<p>“The sādhana of the one-pronged vajra.</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform the sādhana of the vajra, one should make a vajra from clay from an anthill, mixed with sand. Living on alms, observing silence, and acting in a non-threatening manner, one should take hold of this vajra and recite the mantra three hundred thousand times. The vajra thus used must be one-pronged. One should place this vajra nearby among white mustard seeds and keep it there while reciting the mantra until the mustard makes a hissing sound, which indicates that the vajra is now successfully empowered. While holding it, one can accomplish any activity, such as pulverizing mountains; drying up nāga ponds; reversing the flow of rivers; putting the nāgas to flight; removing poison; paralyzing, confusing, or bringing ruin upon any being; destroying magical devices; or arresting the movement of carts and so forth, or turning them to dust. One can perform all this and any other activity. {26.49}</p>
<p>“Nobody can possibly create obstacles for someone doing the practice of the uṣṇīṣa [king] Cakravartin, as one becomes Mūrdhaṭaka in person, if the right procedure is followed, but not without it. During the recitation session, one should always recite the mantra of Buddhalocanā at the beginning and at the end. In this way one will invoke gentle benevolence. One’s accomplishment will become apparent. {26.50}</p>
<p>“[The sādhana of Śrī (Lakṣmī).]</p>
<p>“One should descend to a river that flows into the ocean and set afloat as an offering one hundred thousand lotuses. [The goddess] Śrī will arrive and grant a boon; she will grant a kingdom. If one then offers three hundred thousand lotuses, one will become the king of all the land, as well as the supreme monarch of Jambūdvīpa. If one erects the painting before a hole in the ground and recites the mantra three hundred thousand times, all the magical devices [that block the entrance] will fall. One should enter without fear. Inside, one should extract the elixir of longevity. One should remain there.  There will be no danger from Viṣṇu’s discus. Even if the discus makes it inside, it will be turned to ashes by the mere recollection of the mantra. It can be revived by a mere wish. It will never enter again. {26.51}</p>
<p>“[Various rites.]</p>
<p>“Starting from the first day of a bright fortnight, one should strike, thrice a day, the big toe of the Blessed One’s foot with jasmine flowers incanted one time until light radiates from the toe and enters one’s own body. At this very moment one’s straight hair will become curly, and one will fly up surrounded by a retinue. One will become the king of vidyādharas and will live for one eon. {26.52}</p>
<p>“One should erect on the ocean shore the painting facing west, light a fire using sticks of cobra’s saffron, and offer into it one hundred thousand oblations of flowers of cobra’s saffron, dedicating them to the ocean. Waves will arise there. One should not fear such signs of success; they will continue to appear until Samudra himself appears in the guise of a brahmin and says, ‘What can I do for you?’ One should reply, ‘Surrender to my control.’ He will then do whatever one asks for. {26.53}</p>
<p>“One should draw a thousand-petaled lotus on the ground, sit upon it, and recite the mantra one hundred thousand times. A [real] lotus will grow out of the earth. Being thus lifted up, one will fly up surrounded by a retinue of one thousand. One will become the king of vidyādharas with a lifespan of one great eon. One’s halo will radiate within a five-league radius without causing any alarm [to anyone].{26.54}</p>
<p>“One should offer, during the prātihāra bright fortnight, one hundred thousand jasmine flowers above the uṣṇīṣa of the Blessed One, reciting the mantra over each and every flower, until a light radiates from the uṣṇīṣa and enters one’s own body. At that very moment one will acquire  the five superknowledges. When one has thus incanted and offered one million flowers, if one then recites whatever vidyā one wants to employ along with the mantra of the Blessed One, she will definitely arrive in person while being recited. If she fails to arrive, she will burst at the head and wither away. {26.55}</p>
<p>“This One Syllable is indeed the cakravartin Uṣṇīṣa, a tathāgata in person. Who else could be the tathāgata king of all the mantras and vidyās in this world with its gods? The most prominent uṣṇīṣa kings in his retinue are Sitātapatra and Tejorāśi. One should employ the same complete sādhana procedure of each of the uṣṇīṣa kings. All the uṣṇīṣa kings can be accomplished by means of this [sādhana alone]. If one desires the supreme accomplishment, one must not employ [him] in the wrong place or time. If one does, the supreme accomplishment will not come. In short, all the gods can be summoned with this [One Syllable]. {26.56}</p>
<p>“[With One Syllable,] one can also unveil a treasure trove. One should go to where the trove is, take a white jar, smear it with ‘all fragrances,’ fill it with water infused with white sandalwood, incant it with the mantra one thousand and eight times, and deposit it where the trove [is supposed to be]. If the trove is there, the earth will burst open. If it is at the depth of a human height, one should sprinkle the area with water—one will be able to grasp it after digging one cubit deep. {26.57}</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform the sādhana of a lion, one should make its effigy from the clay of an anthill, smear it with bovine bezoar, place it on a pedestal, and offer a large pūjā. One should recite the mantra until the lion moves; once it does, the practitioner has accomplished the rite. His hair forming curls like earrings, he will fly up surrounded by a retinue of four, mounted on [the lion’s] back.  He will live as long as Brahmā—ninety thousand years—without being interfered with by any of the vidyādharas. The sādhanas of elephants, horses, and buffaloes can be accomplished in the same way. Whenever he utters a lion’s roar, the gods will fall off their seats. {26.58}</p>
<p>“If one goes to a lotus pond and offers one hundred thousand lotuses, one will obtain an entire kingdom. Should one offer one hundred thousand buds of red oleander flowers, one will obtain a king’s daughter. If one offers one hundred thousand jasmine flowers into a river that empties into the ocean, one will obtain whatever girl one desires and will accomplish the highest practices. {26.59}</p>
<p>“Through this mantra of the cakravartin Uṣṇīṣa, wherever one goes, even Indra himself will vacate and offer his seat. All the gods, seeing one at a distance, will become awed and afraid. One will reduce the radius of the gods’ halos to just one fathom, while radiating one’s own for one hundred leagues.{26.60}</p>
<p>“He, One Syllable, is the tathāgata-cakravartin in this world with its gods. All the other blessed uṣṇīṣa cakravartins taught in this manual remain in his thrall. All the other mantra systems along with their respective detailed manuals are subordinate to him.”{26.61}</p>
<p>So spoke Blessed lion Śākyamuni, the lion and the most eminent among men.</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed twenty-sixth chapter, with instructions on the ritual procedures of the rites of the cakravartin One Syllable and his painting, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 27</p>
<p>At that time, the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and the hosts of gods dwelling there, as well as all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyeka­buddhas, and the noble śrāvakas, and once again addressed Mañjuśrī the divine youth: {27.1}</p>
<p>“This complete basket of teachings of all the tathāgatas, O Mañjuśrī, is as illustrious as a wish-fulfilling gem. It is taught in order to make beings into receptacles wherein results will be born. During the lowest eon, at the time when the buddhafield is empty,  the tathāgatas are in the state of nirvāṇa and the genuine Dharma tools have disappeared. At such a time, in order to preserve the mantra basket of all the tathāgatas’ teachings, this One Syllable, O Mañjuśrī, taught in this king of manuals of your mantra methods, the manual of the divine youth, will become a shared treasure, which, when recited according to procedure, will fulfill the wishes of all beings. This cakravartin, One Syllable, taught in your king of manuals, constitutes the essential core of the mantra systems of all the tathāgatas and is the most prominent [part of] them. When one recites him, all the tathāgata-vidyārājas are being recited. {27.2}</p>
<p>“But there is, Mañjuśrī, yet another one-syllable mantra in your king of manuals, taught in the past, that is a treasure of great excellence, the most eminent and precious. In bygone times, as many eons ago as the grains of sand in sixty-two Gaṅgā rivers, there was a tathāgata by the name of Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, an arhat, a fully realized buddha endowed with the vidyā conduct, a supreme sugata who knows the ways of the world, a leader able to tame people, an instructor of gods and men, a blessed buddha the mere recollection of whom, or hearing whose name, neutralizes even the five acts of immediate retribution. Many beings who merely hear his name will definitely progress toward awakening—how much more is this true for those beings who accomplish his mantra! {27.3}</p>
<p>“It is necessary that all mantra reciters keep in their minds, first and foremost, this blessed tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra. They also should say, ‘Homage to the blessed tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra,  the arhat, the perfectly realized buddha!’ After that they should pay homage to Amitābha, Ratnaketu, and all the buddhas and recite the mantras of their choice. They will swiftly obtain accomplishments. {27.4}</p>
<p>“For that reason, if one wants to greatly increase one’s store of merit, one should salute and call out the names of the three tathāgatas and always bow to all the tathāgatas. Always dedicated to the pursuit of awakening, one will complete the accumulation of virtue and henceforth will be counted among the bodhisattvas. One’s mantras will swiftly fulfill their aim. {27.5}</p>
<p>“This single-syllable mantra was taught by Tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, the arhat, the perfectly realized buddha. This mantra, the essence of all the tathāgatas, is cherished in all the mantra systems. It accomplishes all activities. O Mañjughoṣa! This mantra, the most secret in your king of manuals, should be employed by people in utmost secrecy for their own good.{27.6}</p>
<p>“This mantra is not suitable for those</p>
<p>Who are not students, do not follow the Dharma,</p>
<p>Or have no faith in the teachings of the Teacher,</p>
<p>As propagated by the victorious ones.{27.7}</p>
<p>“Nor should this mantra ever be used</p>
<p>By the wicked, the arrogant,</p>
<p>Or those who find faults in the teachings of the Teacher</p>
<p>Or have no faith in the Buddha’s sons. {27.8}</p>
<p>“Nor is it suitable for the śrāvakas or the rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>Who are unable to accept and adopt worship.</p>
<p>The mantra should not be given to them,</p>
<p>As they would not see success. {27.9}</p>
<p>“On the other hand, one who has trust, is gentle,</p>
<p>Has faith in the teachings of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>Always [acts like] a bodhisattva,</p>
<p>And embraces worship wholeheartedly {27.10}</p>
<p>“Will accomplish the mantra</p>
<p>Taught by me in this manual—</p>
<p>The great one-syllable mantra</p>
<p>Prescribed by Mañjughoṣa. {27.11}</p>
<p>“This mantra that brings happiness</p>
<p>Has been given by him, the lord of the world—</p>
<p>It is the essence of all the buddhas</p>
<p>And the source of all the mantras. {27.12}</p>
<p>“The self-arisen [lord] formerly taught,</p>
<p>For the benefit and welfare of beings beguiled by evil,</p>
<p>Seven hundred and sixty</p>
<p>Million mantras. {27.13}</p>
<p>“All of these mantras have gone back to their origin</p>
<p>And abide in the image of the Teacher.</p>
<p>This very powerful vidyārāja, however,</p>
<p>The profound essence of these mantras,</p>
<p>Remains ever active,</p>
<p>Contained within the single syllable. {27.14}</p>
<p>“The ultimate essence of the teachings of the buddhas</p>
<p>Is thus preserved for the benefit of the world,</p>
<p>Being stored in this Dharma device,</p>
<p>This single syllable. {27.15}</p>
<p>“This one-syllable mantra accomplishes all aims;</p>
<p>It can ward off hostile kings,</p>
<p>Perform a variety of activities,</p>
<p>And accomplish all rites. {27.16}</p>
<p>“It can thus perform without fail</p>
<p>One thousand and eight activities</p>
<p>And bestow various benefits</p>
<p>If employed in a rite as prescribed by the rule. {27.17}</p>
<p>“The letter m, included in this mantra,</p>
<p>Is the heart essence of Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>The letter u was set to function in this world</p>
<p>As the ever-omniscient [Mañjuśrī], aware of the modes of life.{27.18}</p>
<p>“[This] definitive meaning</p>
<p>Was taught by Amitāyurjñāna­rājendra</p>
<p>And conferred by the Buddha upon Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>To endow him with the power to enthrall. {27.19}</p>
<p>“This mantra, at the end of the eon in this world,</p>
<p>When the Teacher is in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Swiftly brings accomplishment,</p>
<p>If the rites are performed according to rule. {27.20}</p>
<p>“There is a place called Amitāyus, ‘Infinite Life,’</p>
<p>Designated as a buddhafield.</p>
<p>It is there that this blessed buddha,</p>
<p>The turner of the wheel of Dharma, {27.21}</p>
<p>“Remains throughout infinite eons,</p>
<p>Blessing that field with his lifelong presence.</p>
<p>This is why his name is Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya,</p>
<p>‘Expounder of the Knowledge of Infinite Life.’ {27.22}</p>
<p>“This tathāgata with great miraculous power</p>
<p>Is the king of kings of all the worlds.</p>
<p>He gave this eminent, excellent mantra</p>
<p>To the Buddha’s son of great intelligence, {27.23}</p>
<p>“The most senior among [the Buddha’s] foremost sons,</p>
<p>Distinguished by great strength and miraculous power.</p>
<p>This son, in turn, entrusted</p>
<p>This mantra to Samantabhadra. {27.24}</p>
<p>“This buddha son, in turn,</p>
<p>Gave it to Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>Now I, a tathāgata, will pronounce</p>
<p>[This mantra]—the best [part of] his ritual.”{27.25}</p>
<p>This foremost of [Mañjughoṣa’s] mantras</p>
<p>Was then pronounced by the Dharma king.</p>
<p>He spoke this mantra for the benefit and welfare</p>
<p>Of all sentient beings: {27.26}</p>
<p>“Homage to Tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, the arhat, the perfectly realized buddha! Homage to all the buddhas, starting with Śālendra­rāja, Amitāyus, Amitābha, and Ratnaketu.</p>
<p>After saluting them, one should recite the one-syllable mantra thrice. What is this mantra?</p>
<p>“Muṁ.{27.27}</p>
<p>“It is this mantra, friends, that was taught by Tathāgata Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, the arhat, the perfectly realized buddha who dwells in the world sphere Amitavyūhavatī. He passed on [this mantra] to the eldest and closest son of all the tathāgatas, the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in order to bring benefit, welfare, and happiness to all beings. He did this out of compassion for and in order to benefit many people, especially the future generations at the time when [the Buddha’s] teaching would disappear, knowing that such a time would come. He did this in order to rein in the wicked kings who would transgress against the Three Jewels during the last, lowest eon. {27.28}</p>
<p>“[Mahā­sthāma­prāpta,] through the Buddha’s blessing, passed on [this mantra] to Samantabhadra. Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, the great being, passed it on to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, out of his kindness for all beings and the power of his compassion, then placed this mantra in his heart, in his own body. {27.29}</p>
<p>“Thinking about the future time, when the Buddha’s teaching disappears during the lowest eon,  I will be the last tathāgata. During that debased time, the lowest eon, this excellent mantra will effectively protect my teachings. {27.30}</p>
<p>“I will now teach the ritual of this [mantra]. Listen, Mañjusvara, O divine youth with a pleasant voice, to the detailed instructions on the great ritual of your [mantra]! I will [now] teach at great length the king of rituals [that employs] this [mantra]. {27.31}</p>
<p>“To start, one should climb a mountain and recite the mantra two million times; this constitutes the preliminary practice. One should recite while living on a diet of milk dishes, observing silence, focusing the mind on the mantra and nothing else, fully embracing the triple refuge, generating bodhicitta, observing [the prescribed fasts] and the precepts of morality, and fully embracing the conduct consistent with the bodhisattva vows. After this, one can commence the rites. {27.32}</p>
<p>“First, one should commission a painting. This should be done in a clean place by a painter who is observing the ritual fast, using uncontaminated paints and a clean piece of either cloth or silk suffused with sandalwood, camphor, and saffron. The painter himself must be clean, eat the three white foods, and wear clean clothes. He should be requested to paint during an auspicious nakṣatra, on the fifteenth day of the bright fortnight when the moon is perfectly full, [starting] at sunrise and [continuing] until midday. He should avoid [painting] past [midday]. He should continue in this way day after day until the painting is finished. {27.33}</p>
<p>“On the canvas, one should first paint the world called Amitāyurvatī. On a cloth measuring one cubit, or a square piece of silk one width of the Buddha’s hand across, one should paint Amitāyurvatī, adorned below with mountains consisting of ruby, sapphire, and emerald, with palaces upon them embellished with fine jewels and adorned with raised flags and banners. {27.34}</p>
<p>“In the center, one should paint Tathāgata Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra,  sitting on a jeweled throne [supported by] lions and expounding the Dharma. He is surrounded by a halo of light, and has a pure, pink complexion. {27.35}</p>
<p>“To [Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra’s] left, one should paint the bodhisattva great being Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, sitting on a seat of precious stone, holding forth in his [right] hand a yak-tail whisk, and directing his gaze at the tathāgata. In his left hand he is holding a citron. His body, adorned with all the ornaments, is of the light purple color of beautyberry and is surrounded by a blazing halo of light. {27.36}</p>
<p>“To [Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra’s] right, one should paint the bodhisattva great being Blessed Samantabhadra sitting on [a seat of] precious stone, waving a white yak-tail whisk held forth in his [right] hand. In his left, he is holding a jewel. He is adorned with all the ornaments and wears a crown blazing with jewels. His body color is that of the light purple beautyberry. He is wearing short trousers of blue silk and a pearl necklace, is invested with a jeweled sacred thread, and is surrounded by a halo of blazing light. {27.37}</p>
<p>“To [Samantabhadra’s] right, one should paint Noble Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, with his head adorned with five locks of hair, wearing the ornaments of a boy-child, and of golden complexion. He is wearing short trousers of blue silk, a pearl necklace, and a sacred thread adorned with various jewels. His gaze is directed at Tathāgata [Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra], and he is smiling slightly. His beautiful form is of a peaceful aspect. He should be painted endowed with all the supreme features and with his hands folded together. {27.38}</p>
<p>“Below [Samantabhadra], one should paint the practitioner in his usual form and bearing his distinguishing marks. He should be painted in the furthermost corner of the canvas, kneeling down, with his head bowed forward. {27.39}</p>
<p>“Above Blessed [Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra], one should paint four blessed buddhas: to the right, Amitābha and Puṇyābha and  above on the left the other two tathāgatas, Śālendra­rāja and Ratnaketu. They all are surrounded by halos of blazing light, have golden complexions, and are endowed with all the supreme features. Bestrewn with all kinds of flowers, they sit on identical lotus seats in cross-legged posture. Peaceful in appearance, they expound the Dharma.{27.40}</p>
<p>“Above Blessed [Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra], one should paint Sunetra with the body of a tathāgata, flying among the clouds and raining down flowers. He is endowed with all the supreme features and surrounded by a halo of blazing light. With his right hand he shows the boon-granting gesture and, with his left, he is holding the corner of his robe. {27.41}</p>
<p>“This is the painting procedure of the blessed tathāgata Amitāyurviniścaya­rājendra, the arhat, the fully realized buddha. And the one-syllable mantra [given before] is his mantra. This mantra is equal to an uṣṇīṣa king, a cakravartin; it is equal to him in courage and power. It has great magical efficacy and power, and a mighty array of inconceivable qualities. {27.42}</p>
<p>“In short, this mantra will accomplish, just like the tathāgata-uṣṇīṣa king, the great Cakravartin, all the rites that have been taught in detail for One Syllable. This mantra will accomplish these rites through mere recitation even when it has yet to be fully mastered, let alone when it has been. It will bring whatever result is desired. Through merely seeing the painting, whatever is pleasing to the mind will come true, and one will definitely be on course toward awakening. {27.43}</p>
<p>“Through the blessing of Blessed Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, this mantra is said to be the heart essence of all  the tathāgatas; it is said to be the uṣṇīṣa king of all the tathāgatas; it is said to be the cakravartin; and it is said to be the great king of cakravartins. It is also said to be the heart essence of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. It is called One Syllable. In short, its power is inconceivable because the Buddha’s blessing is inconceivable, and so are his miracles. {27.44}</p>
<p>“One may not have fully mastered the One Syllable or performed the preparatory rites. One may have to do all the house chores, may eat everything [including] wine and meat, or indulge in sex. If, however, one has no faith and has not developed bodhicitta, the accomplishment will not be won. Similarly, those that offend against or harm the followers of the Three Jewels will not accomplish even a minor rite, let alone obtain a middling or supreme accomplishment.</p>
<p>Those who predominantly pursue sexual and culinary pleasures can fulfill them by engaging in minor activities with over one thousand and eight rites. What are these rites? {27.45}</p>
<p>“At the beginning, one will effect self-protection with a single recitation. A double recitation will protect others. With three recitations, one will effect ‘great protection,’ whereby not even a great bodhisattva established on the tenth level would be able to disturb one, not to mention other beings. {27.46}</p>
<p>“If one ties around one’s hips a five-colored thread incanted four times, one will arrest the semen, so that no emission will occur during one’s sleep unless one wants it to. If one is content being alone, whether by day or by night, one should do [the arresting] every day. If not, one can instead incant ashes seven times and sprinkle one’s abdomen—the semen will be arrested for  three weeks. If one incants [the ashes] five times while contemplating Lord Buddha, the person whom one besprinkles with it will become enthralled. {27.47}</p>
<p>“During a lunar eclipse when the moon disk has disappeared, one should light a fire with sticks of the crown flower plant and, even if one does not use the painting, offer ten thousand oblations of ghee while facing east. One should perform this homa near the place where the king lives—by a river close to the royal palace, or by a temple, but not inside it. In the morning the king will be enthralled and do whatever he is told. If, at the time, he does not grant an audience, he will become downcast or slow, and will be unable to concentrate. {27.48}</p>
<p>“If this happens, one must follow up with a countermeasure—one should offer one thousand and eight oblations of milk at the first opportunity. From then on, the king will be well again. One must not target with this rite those who have faith and trust in the Three Jewels or who have given rise to bodhicitta. If one were to target them, one would accumulate an enormous amount of nonvirtue. One can only target others who are miscreants. One should show oneself every day to the wicked-minded and impetuous; they will become gentle. If they do not, they will be separated from much wealth and left with nothing but their living breath.{27.49}</p>
<p>“There is also the following rite. At the time of a lunar eclipse, one should light a fire with sticks of the dhak tree and offer one thousand and eight oblations of ghee. In the morning, the king of the country will accept advice on matters that require consultation. One will be able to point out to him what is right to do. If one instructs him, he will donate, within six months, a village capable of providing one thousand alms of food. If one does the above homa for half a night, one will obtain the village within three months; if one does the homa throughout all the watches  of the night, within one month. If one does the homa every night for one month, one will obtain a district, or a village equal to a district, or another domain with some wealth. One will not have any enemies; should enemies appear, one should do the rite again. {27.50}</p>
<p>“At the time of a lunar eclipse, one should light a fire with sticks of devil’s horsewhip. If one’ enemies are brahmins, one should offer one thousand and eight oblations of dhak sticks smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, and after that, one thousand and eight oblations of neem tree leaves, smeared with white mustard oil. In the morning the brahmins will be appeased and the king will cease to be hostile.{27.51}</p>
<p>“There is also the following rite. At the time of a lunar eclipse, one should light a fire of whatever sticks are available and offer one thousand and eight oblations of ghee. At the end of the homa, one should throw the ashes in the direction where the king lives; he will become enthralled. He will grant in abundance whatever enjoyments, and at whatever time, one desires, including his [personal] assistance. He will donate a small, medium, or large village or district. Within six months, one will certainly obtain an unfailing (amogha) accomplishment.{27.52}</p>
<p>“If a member of any of the four castes develops a cruel disposition, then, regardless of whether he is of a degraded or an elevated status, or is a devotee of other deities or worldly beings, if one casts the ashes in the direction where he lives, he will be driven from his home to another country. He will feel uneasy and escape at night, or his family will be destroyed. To undo this, one should offer one thousand and eight oblations of milk; [the target] will become well.{27.53}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. It should be performed during a lunar eclipse following the same procedure, before a painting depicting the buddhas and the bodhisattvas, before a holy scripture, or before a caitya containing relics, by a practitioner who is clean, wears clean clothes, and has fasted for one day and one night on water free of living organisms. He should fumigate the place [for the rite] with an incense of camphor, fragrant dried flowers, sandalwood, and saffron. {27.54}</p>
<p>“If the rite is performed on account of enemies who are brahmins, one should light the fire with sticks of the dhak tree; if they are kṣatriyas, with sticks of the bodhi tree; if they are vaiśyas, with sticks of the cutch tree; if they are śūdras, with sticks of some other tree. One should then undertake the rite proper. The sticks to be offered in the homa for the brahmins should be of the dhak tree; those for the kṣatriyas, of the bodhi tree; those for the vaiśyas, of the cutch tree; those for the śūdras, of devil’s horsewhip, or another tree as available. The homa rite should be performed using ghee.{27.55}</p>
<p>“Similarly, for a homa on account of an important king, one should offer one thousand and eight oblations of the root of butterfly pea and the same number of the oblations of ghee. At the end, one should throw the ashes in the direction where the wicked-minded king lives, or from where he will arrive. One may, in addition, form the mudrā of the one-syllable uṣṇīṣa cakravartin, or the utpala mudrā. The king will become frightened and will turn back, or his army will fall, or another unexpected calamity will befall him. He may be struck by disease, develop mental problems, or have his words refuted. {27.56}</p>
<p>“There are these and other rites—any that one may wish for. If one incants clothes and wears them, one will become very prosperous. If one incants [collyrium] and anoints the eyes, one will be loved by all people. If one incants the eyes and one’s entire face seven times and then looks an angry person in the face, they will become enthralled and peaceful. If one incants seven times a fruit, a flower, or anything with a pleasant smell, and then offers it to the king, he will become enthralled through merely smelling it. Any other being will become enthralled through merely seeing it. If one suffers from pain in any limb,  one should wash it with warm water incanted one hundred and eight times; one will become well again. {27.57}</p>
<p>“These rites should not target</p>
<p>Beings that are afflicted by suffering,</p>
<p>Those without a protector, the morally fallen, the weak,</p>
<p>Or those who observe vows in this tradition. {27.58}</p>
<p>“Rites of this kind should not target</p>
<p>Those who have faith in the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>They should not target women,</p>
<p>The young, the old, or those who are sick. {27.59}</p>
<p>“Likewise, they should not target</p>
<p>The destitute, the suffering,</p>
<p>The insignificant, or those of inferior birth.</p>
<p>They should target beings of stature,{27.60}</p>
<p>“Such as warriors, the impetuous, the greedy,</p>
<p>Those with a large following or much wealth,</p>
<p>The haughty, or the violent.</p>
<p>It is them that such rites should target. {27.61}</p>
<p>“Also, those who hate the teachings;</p>
<p>The cruel; those who steal others’ property,</p>
<p>Who have no trust in any mantras,</p>
<p>Remedies, or yogins;{27.62}</p>
<p>“And also impudent ones with wicked minds,</p>
<p>Or kings despised by the subjects—</p>
<p>It is them that the rites should target,</p>
<p>Not those who are righteous. {27.63}</p>
<p>“The following rite is said to be forbidden</p>
<p>By the buddhas [to target the righteous].</p>
<p>If the reciter casts the ashes,</p>
<p>With an angry mind, in a particular direction, {27.64}</p>
<p>“Any cruel enemies who are there</p>
<p>Will perish along with their king.</p>
<p>All the people there will inevitably</p>
<p>Suffer from a long-term exhaustion, {27.65}</p>
<p>“And terrible, deadly plagues</p>
<p>Will be seen in that place.</p>
<p>However, one should not perform [such] rites,</p>
<p>Lest one also falls into distress. {27.66}</p>
<p>“After three weeks all the people</p>
<p>And kings there will perish.</p>
<p>Once the rite takes full effect,</p>
<p>One should terminate it within fourteen days.{27.67}</p>
<p>“In the first [week, the target] will become mentally disturbed;</p>
<p>In the second, they will become exhausted;</p>
<p>And in the third, they will die—that is why</p>
<p>One should avoid [continuing the rite beyond the second week]. {27.68}</p>
<p>“In the first week, they will flee,</p>
<p>In the second, they wander throughout the country,</p>
<p>In the third, they perish—</p>
<p>One should not perform such rites. {27.69}</p>
<p>“These rites have been designated by the guides of the world</p>
<p>To be solely for the purpose of guiding beings,</p>
<p>Because the buddhas, having pure minds,</p>
<p>Do not resort to violent means. {27.70}</p>
<p>“All the buddhas abhor</p>
<p>The rites that obstruct the life force;</p>
<p>No reciter should do such rites,</p>
<p>If he desires supreme accomplishment. {27.71}</p>
<p>“One indulging in such wantonness</p>
<p>Will only see one’s own fall into hell.</p>
<p>This has been described as the ripening</p>
<p>Of one’s solely black karma (the result of solely black rites). {27.72}</p>
<p>“As observed by the most eminent among two-legged beings,</p>
<p>The diversity and efficacy of rites (karma)</p>
<p>Always makes the arising of virtue possible;</p>
<p>Black rites of the [practitioner] can still produce virtuous results.{27.73}</p>
<p>“Accordingly, the karma is mixed</p>
<p>And is taught as such.</p>
<p>This is why such a variety of rites</p>
<p>Have been taught by those who know reality.{27.74}</p>
<p>“The reciter should avoid</p>
<p>Black or mixed rites (karma),</p>
<p>But rely on the auspicious white ones,</p>
<p>Which will bring the karmic results of good karma (activities). {27.75}</p>
<p>“Through destroying life,</p>
<p>The reciter will end up in hell again and again.</p>
<p>Desisting from it, which is the practice of ahiṃsā,</p>
<p>Is the supreme activity (karma). {27.76}</p>
<p>“Mastering the mantras</p>
<p>Leads to paradise and happy rebirths,</p>
<p>Which are obtained through skillful rites (meritorious karma)</p>
<p>And blocked by the rites (karma) that are (is) their (its) opposite. {27.77}</p>
<p>“I have explained Dharma and non-Dharma,</p>
<p>Differentiated (viceṣṭita) based on omniscient knowledge.</p>
<p>If the reciter desires accomplishment,</p>
<p>He should always perform virtuous rites (create good karma). {27.78}</p>
<p>“When virtue is present,</p>
<p>The mantras of the practitioner will be successful.</p>
<p>If he is dedicated to white rites (to accumulating good karma),</p>
<p>His liberation is guaranteed. {27.79}</p>
<p>“The tathāgatas proclaim that, for a mantra practitioner,</p>
<p>Accomplishment is obtained through virtue.</p>
<p>For guiding ordinary beings, though,</p>
<p>They teach different types of rites.{27.80}</p>
<p>“One may accomplish, if one so desires,</p>
<p>One thousand and eight rites.</p>
<p>Still, if one performs inferior rites,</p>
<p>One will not obtain the highest accomplishment. {27.81}</p>
<p>“By putting effort into the recitation and the homa,</p>
<p>One will obtain a middling accomplishment.</p>
<p>The inferior accomplishment will be won swiftly</p>
<p>If the rite is [simply] performed according to procedure. {27.82}</p>
<p>“The rites (karma) have been taught</p>
<p>To be of three types—supreme, middling, and inferior.</p>
<p>A superior reciter who is an ascetic</p>
<p>Will obtain the supreme. {27.83}</p>
<p>“A middling reciter will obtain</p>
<p>Success in the middling (will accumulate middling karma).</p>
<p>An inferior reciter will always</p>
<p>Be limited to inferior rites (accumulating inferior karma). {27.84}</p>
<p>“He will win an inferior accomplishment;</p>
<p>He cannot attain any other.</p>
<p>The recitation synchronized with the homa</p>
<p>Is again of three types. {27.85}</p>
<p>“Superior accomplishment results from superior recitation,</p>
<p>The middling is seen as the result of the middling,</p>
<p>And the inferior accomplishment is obtained</p>
<p>If the rite (karma) is minor and inferior.” {27.86}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter with instructions on the ritual procedures for the rites of the one-syllable root mantra—the heart essence of Noble Mañjuśrī—that include the painting, twenty-seventh in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 28</p>
<p>Now the blessed Śākyamuni looked again at the realm of the Pure Abode and said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, in your ritual a painting procedure—a sādhana aid that accomplishes all activities. The ritual performed in front of this painting should employ the aforementioned one-syllable heart mantra, or the six-syllable mantra that ends with ma, or your six-syllable root mantra that starts with oṁ, or the one-syllable mantra. This king of rites will become the means of protection in the future time, when I, the Tathāgata, am in parinirvāṇa and the buddhafield is empty—at the time when the lowest eon has arrived, and the world is without protection or refuge, and with nothing to resort to. This king of rites will then become the refuge, the succor, the place of rest, and the final resort. What is this rite? {28.1}</p>
<p>“To begin, one should draw Blessed Śākyamuni just as before,  on an undamaged cloth that is shorn to remove loose fibers, seven cubits long and three cubits across, with a fringe, and infused with the essence of saffron and sandalwood. He is sitting on a lotus seat and expounding the Dharma, while looking at the divine youth Mañjuśrī. On his right, one should draw Sudhana, Subhūmi, the noble Akṣayamati, and Mañjuśrī, all of them bowing to the Blessed One. Each of them has the form of a divine youth with limbs adorned with all kinds of jewelry. On his left, one should draw Samantabhadra, the noble Avalokiteśvara, Bhadrapāla, and Suśobhana.{28.2}</p>
<p>“They should all be painted smaller than the Blessed One. Avalokiteśvara and Sudhana should be painted with yak-tail whisks in their hands. Below the Blessed One, Vasudhā should be drawn with a basketful of jewels in her hand and the upper half of her body emerging from the earth. Two vidyādhara youths adorned with garlands, and clouds releasing rain and lightning, should be painted above the Blessed One. All the bodhisattvas hold flowers and jewels and look at the Blessed One’s face. They should be painted adorned with all types of jewelry, looking peaceful and happy, with the upper half of their bodies inclined in a sitting position.{28.3}</p>
<p>“One should place the painting near to a caitya containing relics and recite the syllable of Mañjuśrī one hundred thousand times while facing west. One should carefully observe the vow of silence, bathe three times a day, use three pieces of clothing, and continually fast, eating dishes of vegetables and barley and whatever has been obtained as alms. One should divide the food into four parts and offer one part to the Three Jewels, one part to Mañjuśrī, one part to all beings,  and use one part oneself. Not weakened in one’s body, one should visualize the Blessed One and, with the mind focused on all beings, recite the mantra while contemplating, ‘May I never do anything for my own sake, but always for the sake of all beings.’ {28.4}</p>
<p>“One should offer water for bathing, fragrances, flowers, incense, a bali, and lamps, placing the water in the painting’s shadow, the fragrances below the painting, and the flower and bali articles all around. One should first offer these things to the Three Jewels, then to Maitreya, and immediately after to Avalokiteśvara, Noble Samantabhadra, Noble Ākāśagarbha, Noble Akṣayamati, the divine youth Candraprabha, Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin, Noble Vajradhara, Noble Tārā, Noble Mahāmāyūrī, Noble Aparājitā, and Blessed Prajñāpāramitā. First one should offer all of the fragrances, flowers, incense, and the bali articles to those [just mentioned], and then to the painting. {28.5}</p>
<p>“Afterward, at some place outside, using clay from an anthill, one should make figurines of all the vināyakas in the form of camels, donkeys, dogs, and elephants, and offer everything to them. One should remember to avoid oil-seed cakes, cakes made of pounded sesame seeds, horse gram (kulattha), fish, meat, root vegetables, and eggplant. Vessels made of lotus leaves or bell metal should also be avoided. {28.6}</p>
<p>“One should practice the recollection of all the buddhas while sitting and resting on a bundle of kuśa grass. Mantra recitation should be performed mentally. One should prepare a bed in some other secluded place overspread with kuśa grass. One should avoid taking too much food or drink, or going out, seeing people, or sleeping too much. One should thus contemplate the buddhas three times  a day and ensure the retention of semen. One should not disclose one’s auspicious dreams to anyone but offer them instead to the Blessed One. {28.7}</p>
<p>“Proceeding on, one should speedily recite the One Syllable one hundred thousand times. At the end, one should read aloud [the text of] the blessed Prajñāpāramitā. At the time of recitation one should look at the face of Blessed One or the divine youth Mañjuśrī and recite without mixing up the syllables or words. [Each time] one reaches the end of the rosary, one should bow [to them] and offer [oneself to the deity]. Having, in this manner, completed the preliminary practice, one should install the painting in some good place, where one will be able to do the [main] rite in a happy frame of mind.”</p>
<p>This concludes the instructions on the painting procedure. {28.8}</p>
<p>“Subsequently, one should fashion out of white sandalwood [an effigy of] Blessed Mañjuśrī sitting on a lotus seat, with the text of the blessed Prajñāpāramitā in his left hand and, in his right, a fruit. One should install the effigy facing west in a secluded, clean place and dig a fire pit in front of it. The pit should be, for all rites, square and two vitastis across. At the bottom, one should place the fragrances and all kinds of grain and make [the fire] above it. Following this procedure, one should start a new fire, using sticks of the bodhi tree or aśoka tree. One should procure ghee, rice grains, boiled rice, milk, curds, and honey, and place all of it together in a copper bowl. Having incanted it one thousand and eight times, one should perform the complete homa.{28.9}</p>
<p>“Later, on another day, starting during the bright fortnight, one should perform the following rite. One should make the fire using bodhi tree sticks and, seeing that the fire is without smoke, one should summon the god of fire:</p>
<p>“Come! Come, O tawny-yellow one! One with a flaming tongue and red eyes! Give, give generously, O tawny-yellow one! Svāhā!{28.10}</p>
<p>“With this mantra, one should offer three oblations, and then summon Blessed Mañjuśrī with the mantra:</p>
<p>“Come, come, O divine youth!  Please help me as I strive for the welfare of all beings! Take these fragrances, flowers, and incense! Svāhā!{28.11}</p>
<p>“Whatever one offers, one should offer with this [mantra]. When the Blessed One arrives, one should present him with a welcome offering consisting of water with fragrant flowers and later perform a homa rite. One should offer only one oblation incanted seven times. In this way, one should gratify him with ghee, rice, sesame, and barley for seven days. At some point during this period one will certainly see Noble Mañjuśrī in the form of divine youth. {28.12}</p>
<p>“One should offer one thousand and eight oblations of sticks of sandalwood, two fingers long. If one does this every day, one will enthrall one hundred princes. If one offers one hundred thousand flowers of royal jasmine, one will enthrall a king. If one offers one thousand lotuses smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will obtain power substances. If one lights a fire of śamī sticks and offers into it sesame seeds, one will become an owner of great wealth. If one always gets up early and offers oblations of water into water, one will become dear to all the people. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of sticks of the crown flower plant smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will obtain a village [able to provide] one thousand alms rations. If one offers oblations of fenugreek, one will obtain whatever virgin girl one desires. If one offers [sticks of] devil’s horsewhip, one will pacify any pestilence. {28.13}</p>
<p>“If one lights a fire with sticks of a tree rich in sap and offers into it one hundred thousand oblations of sesame, one will obtain whichever girl one wishes for. If one desires sensual pleasures, one should offer one hundred thousand lotuses, and one will obtain them. By offering one hundred thousand oblations of barley, one’s food supply will become inexhaustible. If one offers oblations of bdellium and beautyberry together with ghee, one will obtain a son. If one offers royal jasmine flowers into the water where the crown flower plant [grows on] the bank, one will obtain a village within seven days. If one offers into the water royal jasmine flowers one by one, one will enthrall any person to whom one gives the remaining fragments to smell—the enthrallment will happen through merely smelling them. If one recites the mantra, having put in one’s mouth some saffron, musk, and cloves, the person that one subsequently engages in conversation will become enthralled. {28.14}</p>
<p>“If one puts in one’s mouth some black pepper [seeds], having incanted them one thousand and eight times,  one’s words will be endearing even though one may be angry. If one ties these [seeds] into one’s topknot, one will become invisible. If one looks at an enemy and keeps them in mind, the [enemy’s] anger will depart. {28.15}</p>
<p>“If one recites the mantra continually, one will be loved by all people. If one gets up very early and offers water with [the petals of] royal jasmine flowers, [spilling it] onto a clean place on the ground, one will become a minister whose words cannot be challenged. When fear arises, one should bring to mind [the mantra], and the fear will go away. If one looks at the face of an angry person while engendering and sustaining loving kindness, their anger will depart. {28.16}</p>
<p>“One should offer a homa consisting of all flowers with nice fragrance. Whoever one does this for will become enthralled. If, early in the morning, one drinks water incanted seven times, one will purify the imminent experiences of [ripening] karma. If one washes one’s face with water incanted seven times, one will be loved by all people. Whomever one gives incanted flowers to will become enthralled. {28.17}</p>
<p>“By offering one hundred thousand oblations of [incanted] rice grains, one will become an ācārya. If one does the same with sesame seeds, one will obtain dominion over a district. If one offers one thousand lotuses, one will obtain one thousand dinars. If, on every fifth lunar day, one offers an oblation of bdellium, sarja resin, myrrh, and pine resin, all obtained in a fair bargain and blended together, one will obtain, when six months have passed, one thousand times more. {28.18}</p>
<p>“One should make an effigy of the desired person out of ‘all fragrances,’ chop up its foot with a sharp, single-bladed weapon, and offer the bits as oblations. If the target is a man, one should chop the right foot; if it is a woman, the left. One will thus enthrall whoever one desires. {28.19}</p>
<p>“If one offers oblations of thorn apple flowers for seven days, three times a day, one will obtain cattle. Similarly, if one offers sticks of the crown flower plant, one will obtain grain. With flea tree flowers, one will obtain horses;  with aśoka flowers, gold; with vyādhighātaka, clothes. One can obtain anything one desires with oblations of royal jasmine flowers. Whatever are the colors of the flowers that one offers into the water at sunrise, one will obtain clothes of the same colors. If one does alms rounds with a bowl incanted seven times, one’s supply of alms will never wane. If one gets up at night and incants one’s own body, one will have auspicious dreams. {28.20}</p>
<p>“If one wants to enthrall a king, one should obtain some dust from his feet, mix it with mustard and sesame seeds, and offer this as an oblation for seven days, three times a day. The king will become enthralled. If one wants to enthrall a queen, one should blend together sochal salt, dill, and yams, and offer this as an oblation for seven days, three times a day. She will become enthralled. If one wants to enthrall a royal minister, one should make his effigy out of cashew nut, sesame, and sweet flag, and perform the homa for seven days, three times a day. He will become enthralled. If one wants to enthrall the family priest, one should blend together tubeflower and dill and offer this as an oblation for seven days, three times a day. He will become enthralled. {28.21}</p>
<p>“If one wants to enthrall brahmins, one should offer oblations of milk blended with ghee. All of them will become enthralled. If one wants to enthrall kṣatriyas, one should offer an oblation of rice gruel mixed with ghee for seven days. To enthrall vaiśyas, one should offer barley with sugar. They will become enthralled. If one offers oil-cakes, śūdras will become enthralled. If one mixes all these ingredients together, all the castes will become enthralled.{28.22}</p>
<p>“If anyone suffering from exhaustion offers a bali at a road junction or in an empty house,  they will be freed from exhaustion. If one recites the mantra while touching someone’s face, their fever will depart. If one’s knot of hair is incanted one hundred and eight times, one will be freed from all disease. For any disease, one should make a knot on a thread, tie one’s hair [with it], and go to sleep; all diseases will depart. When one is ravaged by a disease, one can be freed through mantra recitation alone. When one is seized by a throat obstruction, one should incant some clay from an anthill and apply it as a plaster. The disease will depart. In the case of eye disease, one should offer oblations of nīlīkalikas; it will go away.”</p>
<p>This concludes the section on the rites that rely on the painting procedure.{28.23}</p>
<p>“Following the previously described procedure, one should draw on an undamaged cloth, shorn to remove loose fibers, the divine youth Noble Mañjuśrī. He is fully adorned, red in color, has the form of a divine youth, and sits on a lotus seat. On his right is Noble Avalokiteśvara, and on his left, Samantabhadra. Both of them are a little smaller [than Mañjuśrī]. Having installed this painting, one should recite the mantra ten million times; one will become a king. One will, likewise, become a king if one offers one hundred thousand oblations of sandalwood sticks smeared with saffron. The same will occur if one offers one hundred thousand oblations of agalloch sticks smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. The same will occur if one offers ten million oblations of royal jasmine flowers smeared with ghee. {28.24}</p>
<p>“If one offers into the fire a pile of lotuses, one will obtain a hoard of dinars equal in number to the lotuses in the pile. If one does not obtain them while repeating the mantra over each lotus, one will become the monarch of the vidyādharas. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of cashew nuts, this will bring one thousand dinars. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of vyādhighātaka fruits, one will become an owner of great wealth. By offering one hundred and eight oblations of agalloch sticks, one will obtain grain. If one continually offers oblations of sesame, one’s supply of grain will, likewise,  be unbroken. {28.25}</p>
<p>“If one offers into the fire one hundred thousand oblations of cow’s rice mixed with curds, one will obtain one thousand cows. If one offers fenugreek seeds mixed together with śamī fruits, one will obtain whatever virgin girl one desires. If one offers śamī leaves, this will bring all types of pleasure. If one offers flowers of the agati tree smeared with milk, one will enthrall a brahmin. If one offers flowers of white oleander, one will enthrall a kṣatriya. If one offers blossoms of the bayur tree, one will enthrall a king. If one offers flowers of the thorn apple, one will enthrall a śūdra. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of flowers of the crown flower plant smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will be freed from all disease. {28.26}</p>
<p>“Following the same procedure, one should offer one hundred thousand fragrant flowers at the feet; one will definitely obtain happiness. If one lights a fire using sticks of the bodhi tree and offers one thousand oblations of śamī flowers, one will pacify the problems caused by the nakṣatras. If one goes into battle with the mantra inscribed with bovine bezoar tied to one’s head, one will not be touched by weapons. If one places the Mañjuśrī [mantra] on the shoulders of the elephants in the front line of the army, the enemy army will be crushed through merely seeing it. If one goes into battle, having affixed, at the end of a banner, a figurine of the divine youth sitting on a golden peacock throne, the enemy army will be crushed through merely seeing it. {28.27}</p>
<p>“One should offer one hundred thousand flowers of royal jasmine at the feet and go to sleep on a bed of kuśa grass spread at the same spot. In one’s dreams one will be told whatever one wanted [to know]. Having offered one thousand lamps, one should prepare a single lamp with a wick of lotus stalk fibers, wrap it in licorice, light it, and look on; one will behold Mañjuśrī,  the divine youth, as he really is.”</p>
<p>This concludes the second [group of rites that rely on] the painting procedure. {28.28}</p>
<p>“One should make a figurine of the divine youth out of gold or silver, with the right hand forming the boon-granting gesture and the left holding a text of the blessed Prajñāpāramitā. Having placed it before a suchlike basket containing relics, one should recite the one-syllable mantra one hundred thousand times. One should worship it with offerings during the daytime and feed, in front of the figurine, male and female children. One should provide song, music, and book reading. When the mantra recitation [of one hundred thousand repetitions] is completed, one should make a farewell offering of the three types of flowers and ask [the deity] to depart. This should be done following the previously described procedure for the summoning and the dismissing. {28.29}</p>
<p>“One should form the padma mudrā and recite the mantra. Then, with the banner mudrā, one should do the invoking; with the swastika mudrā, one should offer the seat; with the complete mudrā, the welcome offering; with the singleliṅga mudrā, flowers; with the wishing mudrā, lamps; with the twin mudrā, incense; with the peacock throne mudrā, fragrances; and with the staff mudrā, a bali. Following this procedure, one should practice day and night, day after day, until the mantra recitation [of one hundred thousand repetitions] is completed. After that, one can commence the rites. {28.30}</p>
<p>“If one sets afloat on a river that flows toward the ocean one hundred thousand flowers of royal jasmine, one will obtain a dominion. If one places, at nighttime, a heap of royal jasmine flowers before the Blessed One and goes to sleep there, one will see in one’s dream the Blessed One teaching the Dharma, surrounded by bodhisattvas. One should do this rite only for the intended person and no one else.{28.31}</p>
<p>“If one offers, while fasting, oblations of pine resin incense mixed with honey, starting during the bright fortnight, one will obtain a kingdom. If one recites the mantra ten million times, one will behold Mañjuśrī in person, and he will teach the Dharma. If one brings [him] up [in conversation] with someone, he will appear directly.  One will become a bodhisattva irreversibly established on the path to buddhahood.”</p>
<p>This concludes the third group of rites that rely on the painting procedure. {28.32}</p>
<p>“One should fashion out of red sandalwood the form of the divine youth flanked by Priyaṅkara on one side and Vīramatī, sheltered by an aśoka tree, on the other. One should place them to one side and make a replica [of them] from red sandalwood mixed with salt, mustard, and brown mustard. One should finely chop [the replica] and offer [the fragments] as oblations. One whose name one recites while making the offering will become enthralled. Similarly, one whose name one recites while offering udumbara fruits will become enthralled. So too, one whose name one recites while offering kākodumbarikā fruits will become enthralled. {28.33}</p>
<p>“If one wants to enthrall a brahmin, one should offer oblations of śṛṅgāṭaka; if it is a kṣatriya, one should offer lotus roots; if it is a vaiśya, one should offer kaśeruka roots; if it is a śūdra, one should offer oblations of śālūka. If one offers one thousand and eight oblations of salt and sugar grains three times a day for seven days, whoever’s name one recites while offering, that person will be enthralled. If one offers one thousand and eight oblations of neem tree leaves smeared with mustard oil three times a day for seven days, whoever’s name one uses while offering, that person will be enthralled. Each of these homa rites will result in enthrallment. {28.34}</p>
<p>“If one offers into the fire one hundred thousand flowers of yellow-berried nightshade, one will obtain gold. If one offers one thousand and eight kālāñjikā flowers, one will obtain a large village. If one offers flowers of the trumpet flower tree, one’s supply of grain will be inexhaustible. If one offer flowers of śrīparṇī, one will obtain gold. If one offers sweet flag smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will have an upper hand in all debates. If one places in a copper dish juice of the brāhmī plant blended with ghee, incants it ten thousand times, and drinks it,  one will be victorious in all debates. If one throws, in front of an angry person, a lump of earth incanted one thousand and eight times, their anger will depart.”</p>
<p>This concludes the fourth group of rites that rely on the painting procedure. {28.35}</p>
<p>“One should commission a painter to paint, while observing the ritual fast, on an undamaged, shorn cloth and using uncontaminated paints, Noble Mañjuśrī sitting on a lotus seat and teaching the Dharma. On his right is Noble Mahāmekhalā, and on his left, Noble Prajñāpāramitā. The latter is reciting mantras, is adorned in all types of adornments, and is dressed in white clothes. Below Noble Mañjuśrī, there is a lotus lake dotted with many different species of lotus, where two nāga kings, their bodies submerged, hold lotus stalks in their hands.{28.36}</p>
<p>“Noble Aparājitā, to one side, is destroying vināyakas and obstructers. Her mouth is blazing with fire and her brow is knitted. On the other side there is Noble Parṇaśavarī. She is dark, with red eyes, and she holds a noose and an axe in her hands. Mounted upon a peacock, she is the practitioner’s protectress. The practitioner, for his part, should be painted holding a garland of lotuses in his hands and looking at the face of Noble Mañjuśrī. Above Noble Mañjuśrī two gods should be painted, holding in their hands yak-tail whisks, flower garlands, and drums. {28.37}</p>
<p>“One should install this painting facing west in a caitya containing relics and recite the mantra ten million times. At the end of the recitation, one should offer a large pūjā, have the Prajñāpāramitā read aloud, and recite the mantra ten thousand times while looking at Mañjuśrī’s face. The painting will subsequently shake. One will obtain a kingdom and the divine eye. One will become a vidyādhara and will laugh, will become a wheel turner, and will teach. One will attain  the first bodhisattva level and will listen to Mañjuśrī’s Dharma teachings. {28.38}</p>
<p>“One should, in front of the same painting, obtain ghee from a tawny cow that has given birth to a calf of the same color, place it in a copper bowl, and recite the mantra until the ghee becomes hot, then emits smoke, and then bursts into flames. If one drinks it when it becomes hot, one will become supremely intelligent with the power to remember [everything heard]; if one drinks it when it emits smoke, one will become invisible; if one drinks it when it bursts into flames, one will be able to walk on air. One should place the ghee inside a bowl of unbaked clay with a lid, wrap the bowl in sweet flag and royal jasmine flowers, and recite the mantra until sprouts appear. If one eats the sprouts, one will be able to retain in one’s memory [everything heard]. If one recites the mantra another ten million times, one will behold Mañjuśrī in person, hear his Dharma teachings, and have faith in them. {28.39}</p>
<p>“One should make a hundred-petaled lotus out of gold, place one’s right knee on the ground, and recite the mantra until the lotus emits flames. Through merely holding it, one will become the monarch of the vidyādharas, unassailable by others. One should put some red arsenic, yellow orpiment, or collyrium in a box make of śrīparṇī wood and recite the mantra until the substance makes a crackling sound. Through merely holding it, one will become an invinciblemaster of the rākṣasas and piśācas who roam the earth. {28.40}</p>
<p>“One should take an undamaged sword with all the characteristics of good quality and recite the mantra until the sword acquires a hood like a snake. By holding the sword, one will become an unassailable emperor of vidyādharas and live for an eon. One should wrap some red arsenic in the three metals, place it in one’s mouth, and recite the mantra until it makes a gurgling sound. One will become an invisible sword bearer. Unseen, one will be able to pursue all kinds of virtuous quests, except for the hedonistic ones. One should obtain some pith from a bodhi tree that grows on a śamī tree, wrap it  in the three metals, place it in the mouth, and recite the mantra until it makes a gurgling sound. One will become invincible and will live one thousand years. {28.41}</p>
<p>“One should place a silver wheel in front of an asura opening and recite the mantra until the wheel has breached the [locking] devices set by the asuras and enters there. At that very moment, asura girls will emerge. If one enters their place with them, one will live one eon. One should place an iron trident at the opening of that passage and recite the mantra there. All the locking devices in there will break up. One will be able to enter with the girls that one desires and live there for one eon. One will behold Blessed Maitreya.”</p>
<p>This concludes the fifth group of rites that rely on the painting procedure. {28.42}</p>
<p>“One should commission [a figurine of] Noble Mañjuśrī, the size of a thumb, made from the white crown flower plant. If one offers to it one hundred thousand flowers of the crown flower plant, one will obtain a vassal kingdom. If [the figurine] is made from the root of white oleander, one thumb in size, and one offers to it ten million flowers of the same plant, one will become a minister. If the figurine is made of karahāṭa wood, one vitasti in size, and one offers to it one hundred thousand flowers of the same tree, one will become the general of an army. If the figurine of Noble Mañjuśrī is made of white sandalwood, one vitasti in size, and one offers to it one hundred thousand flowers of royal jasmine, one will become a family priest. {28.43}</p>
<p>“One should commission a figurine of Noble Mañjuśrī made from the wood of the bodhi tree, one finger in size. If one offers to it a jar of unsullied water, one will be highly esteemed by many people. If the figurine is made of ‘all fragrances,’ one will obtain, by offering to it flowers of all the fragrances, whatever one desires. If a practitioner of mantra continually offers oblations of agalloch sticks, he will be highly esteemed by many people. By reciting continually he will purify even the five karmas of immediate retribution; he will see Mañjuśrī at the time of death; and he will propagate  Mañjuśrī’s teachings. {28.44}</p>
<p>“If one recites the mantra one hundred and eight times every time one rises up [in the morning], one will be unassailable by any being. If one looks at the master, having incanted one’s eyes, he will become kindly disposed. Whoever one targets with the rite will be affected within seven days if they are in the same locality; if they are in another village, within twenty-one days; if they are in another province, after four months; if they are in a river, after six months. One may thus accomplish every activity, except for the pleasure-oriented or violent, using the procedure particular to one’s own lineage, and not other mantra [lineages].”</p>
<p>This concludes the sixth group of rites that rely on the painting procedure. {28.45}</p>
<p>“This bliss-granting king of manuals</p>
<p>Is said to be of benefit at the end of the eon.</p>
<p>It was formerly taught by the Sage</p>
<p>For beings with little merit. {28.46}</p>
<p>“It will bring accomplishments</p>
<p>At that terrible and dreadful time</p>
<p>When the teaching of the Teacher,</p>
<p>The majestic Lion of the Śākyas, has disappeared. {28.47}</p>
<p>“Now the seventh procedure will be taught</p>
<p>In this king of manuals that brings happiness.</p>
<p>This ritual procedure of mine is taught</p>
<p>For that terrible time. {28.48}</p>
<p>“This method is intended especially</p>
<p>For beings with little merit.</p>
<p>It is the root cause for the accumulations that lead to awakening;</p>
<p>It is oriented toward the path of the three vehicles. {28.49}</p>
<p>“During this period, I teach beings</p>
<p>The skill in means,</p>
<p>As they will be stupefied by craving</p>
<p>And confused by desire and hatred. {28.50}</p>
<p>“I teach this method for those</p>
<p>Who are controlled by the power of craving—</p>
<p>The method that is the cause of good karma</p>
<p>For those bound by the fetters of craving. {28.51}</p>
<p>“The accomplishment, that which is to be accomplished,</p>
<p>And the power substances arise based on the mantra methods—</p>
<p>They are taught by the guides of the world</p>
<p>For those beings who require guidance.</p>
<p>These rites possess great efficacy</p>
<p>[When performed by] practitioners who recite mantras.”{28.52}</p>
<p>This was spoken by the eminent Sage,</p>
<p>The Lion of the Śākyas, the supreme being.</p>
<p>Having thus taught at length about</p>
<p>The power and efficacy of the mantra system,</p>
<p>He then explained the accomplishment</p>
<p>That never fails during this debased eon. {28.53}</p>
<p>The supreme Victor then said to the hosts of gods</p>
<p>In the realm of the Pure Abode:</p>
<p>“Whatever, friends, was taught at length</p>
<p>In this king of manuals</p>
<p>Constitutes the instructions of Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>Intended for the benefit of the world. {28.54}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter that belongs to the section on the ritual procedures of Noble Mañjuśrī, twenty-eighth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 29</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows: {29.1}</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, in this division of your ritual prescriptions, a seventh [set of] rites involving a painting that will be effective at the end of the [dark] eon and will without fail lead to accomplishment. This accomplishment will include the arising and maturing of happiness, the knowledge of the physical world, and the forestalling of all painful destinies, and it will certainly lead to awakening.” {29.2}</p>
<p>The blessed Śākyamuni then taught the heart mantra of Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“It contains six syllables whose nature is to liberate from the six destinies;</p>
<p>It has an inconceivable, unequaled, and immeasurably great power;</p>
<p>It liberates from the ocean of all the oceans of existence,</p>
<p>From the misery of the three sufferings, and from the fetters that bind one to existence. {29.3}</p>
<p>“It can touch all the worlds</p>
<p>And no spirit can withstand it.</p>
<p>It purifies the paths of [cyclic] existence,</p>
<p>Invincible to all spirits. {29.4}</p>
<p>“It brings about the qualities of buddhahood</p>
<p>And wards off all evil beings.</p>
<p>All the buddhas rejoice in it,</p>
<p>As it produces every good fortune.</p>
<p>It is the most eminent among all the mantras</p>
<p>Included in the teachings of Mañjuśrī. {29.5}</p>
<p>“What is this mantra? It is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ vākyeda namaḥ!</p>
<p>“Now its ritual will be taught. Living on a diet of solid and liquid dishes of vegetables or barley, bathing  and changing clothes thrice a day, one should recite the mantra one hundred thousand times. This constitutes the preliminary practice. Then, one should commission a painter who is fasting to paint Noble Mañjuśrī on an undamaged cloth with fringed edges, using uncontaminated paints. He sits on a lotus seat and teaches the Dharma in the form of a divine youth, adorned with all the ornaments, with his upper robe over one shoulder.{29.6}</p>
<p>“To his left there is Noble Avalokiteśvara with a lotus and a yak-tail whisk in his hands, and to his right, Noble Samantabhadra. Above [Mañjuśrī], two vidyādharas should be drawn emerging from the clouds and holding garlands. Below [Mañjuśrī] should be drawn the practitioner, holding an incense holder in his hand. Mountain peaks should be drawn all around, and below, a lotus lake. {29.7}</p>
<p>“One should install this painting, facing west, in a caitya containing relics, offer a large pūjā, light butter lamps, and cast one thousand and eight flowers of royal jasmine at Mañjuśrī’s face, one at a time, incanting each of them with the mantra. Subsequently, a loud and deep sound of hūṁ will be heard, or the painting will shake. If the sound is heard, one will become a king over the entire earth; if the painting shakes, one will excel among all speakers and will become an adept of all worldly treatises. If one does not succeed [in this], one will become proficient in all rites.”</p>
<p>This concludes the first rite. {29.8}</p>
<p>“One should offer oblations, throughout the entire night, of agalloch sticks smeared with mustard oil, more than half a finger long, onto the smokeless embers of cutch firewood. At sunrise, one will behold Noble Mañjuśrī, who will grant whatever boon one desires, except for hedonistic ones. {29.9}</p>
<p>“One should recite the mantra all night, while burning sandalwood incense in front of the painting without interruption. Subsequently, Blessed Mañjuśrī will arrive in person and give profound  Dharma teachings. One should apply oneself to them with confidence. By doing so, one will be free from all disease and able to fully exercise one’s own will.{29.10}</p>
<p>“One should make a lotus flower out of red sandalwood, six fingers in circumference, complete with a stem, and wipe it with red sandalwood paste. One should then incant the residue of one thousand such oblations one thousand times. Then, during the full moon, one should place it on a lotus leaf and hold it up in one’s hands in front of the painting. One should recite the mantra until the substance emits light. By taking hold of it, one will obtain the form of a sixteen-year-old divine youth, the color of molten gold, exceeding in splendor the sun itself. One will be honored by all the vidyādharas and will live one great eon. After death, one will be reborn in Abhirati. {29.11}</p>
<p>“During a lunar eclipse, one should get some white sweet flag, wipe it with the five products of a cow, stuff some pipal leaves underneath it, and recite the mantra until the sweet flag gets hot, then emits smoke, and then bursts into flames. If it gets hot, one will be able to enthrall all people and outmatch all speakers. If it emits smoke, one will become invisible and live thirty thousand years. If it bursts into flames, one will be able to walk on air and will live for one great eon. {29.12}</p>
<p>“One should obtain some ghee from a tawny cow that has given birth to a calf of the same color, place it in a copper bowl stuffed with seven pipal leaves, and recite the mantra until the triple effect occurs [of the ghee becoming hot, emitting smoke, and bursting into flames]. After drinking it, one will be able to, [respectively], retain in one’s memory everything that one has heard, become invisible, and walk on air. {29.13}</p>
<p>“During a lunar eclipse, one should place some puṣkara seeds in one’s mouth and recite the mantra until the seeds make a bubbling sound. If one places them in the mouth wrapped in the three metals, one will become invisible. One will become visible again after spitting them out. {29.14}</p>
<p>“One should place in one’s mouth some fragrant cloves and recite the mantra six hundred thousand times. Whoever one speaks to will become enthralled. If one recites the mantra one million two hundred thousand times while subsisting on dishes of milk and barley,  one will become a vidyādhara. If one recites the mantra one hundred thousand times while living on alms and observing a strict vow of silence, one will become invisible. If one recites the mantra ten million times, one will receive Dharma teachings from Noble Mañjuśrī [himself] so that one becomes a bodhisattva who sojourns on earth for the last time. If one recites continually, all one’s aims will be accomplished. {29.15}</p>
<p>“The target whose effigy, made of ‘all fragrances,’ one chops up and offers the fragments of as oblations will become enthralled after seven nights. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of bdellium pills, the size of a kernel of the jujube fruit, smeared with ghee, one will obtain one hundred thousand dinars.{29.16}</p>
<p>“One should descend to a river that empties into the ocean and offer one hundred thousand lotuses. One will obtain a great treasure equal in size to the heap [of the offered] lotuses. This treasure will never become exhausted. If one offers into the fire one thousand and eight oblations of white mustard seeds smeared with saffron [paste], one will enthrall a king. If one offers one hundred thousand oblations of sesame seeds smeared with curds, honey, and ghee, one will become a great householder who gives everything away.{29.17}</p>
<p>“One should draw a circle with uncontaminated cow dung, bestrew it with flowers, and recite the mantra one hundred and eight times. If one subsequently reads aloud a genuine Dharma text, one will become supremely intelligent within one month. If one incants bovine bezoar one hundred and eight times and applies it as a bindi, one will be loved by all the people. If one incants [one’s] topknot seven times, one will become invulnerable to assault by any being. {29.18}</p>
<p>“If one offers ten thousand oblations of kiri garlands, one will become free from all disease. If one recites the mantra seven times every day, one will purify the karma that would otherwise be inevitably experienced. If one recites the mantra one hundred and eight times at the time of death, one will behold the complete [form of] Noble Mañjuśrī face to face.</p>
<p>This concludes the seventh [set of] rites [that employ] the painting.” {29.19}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter with the seventh [set of] rites in the section on the ritual procedures that employ the painting of Noble Mañjuśrī, twenty-ninth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 30</p>
<p>At that time, the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows: {30.1}</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, in your mantra treatise, a list of places for accomplishing any vidyārāja mantra, starting with the mantra of Cakravartin—the foremost among all tathāgata-uṣṇīṣas. In brief, everywhere in the northern regions, the mantras of tathāgata-vidyārājas will become accomplished. {30.2}</p>
<p>“In Tibet and in China,</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa will be accomplished.</p>
<p>The mantras that are his</p>
<p>Will be successful there. {30.3}</p>
<p>“[The mantras] of uṣṇīṣa kings</p>
<p>Will be successful there in every respect.</p>
<p>In Kāviśa, Vakhala,</p>
<p>Everywhere in Uḍḍiyāṇa, {30.4}</p>
<p>“In Kaśmīra, Sindhudeśa,</p>
<p>At the foot of the Himalayas—</p>
<p>In these northern countries,</p>
<p>The mantras that are virtuous are effective. {30.5}</p>
<p>“The mantras that are said to effect pacifying,</p>
<p>Whether those chanted by the buddhas in the past,</p>
<p>Those in use today,</p>
<p>Or those that will be uttered by the buddhas in the future, {30.6}</p>
<p>“All of them are effective</p>
<p>In the foothills of the Himalayas;</p>
<p>In that auspicious and virtuous region</p>
<p>One should undertake pacifying activities. {30.7}</p>
<p>“The mantras originating in the Lotus family</p>
<p>Are accomplished in Madhyadeśa.</p>
<p>Commonly observed there are also the accomplishments</p>
<p>Of the Elephant and the Jewel families.{30.8}</p>
<p>“The mantras of beings of yakṣa origin,</p>
<p>Such as the yakṣa Pañcika, and [the yakṣiṇī] Hārītī,</p>
<p>And also the mantras of gandharva beings,</p>
<p>All bring their respective accomplishments there. {30.9}</p>
<p>“Indeed, in the city of Vārāṇasī;</p>
<p>Everywhere in Magadha;</p>
<p>In Aṅga in the east,</p>
<p>And everywhere in Kāmarūpa;{30.10}</p>
<p>“On the pleasant banks of the Brahmaputra,</p>
<p>And everywhere in Vaṅga,</p>
<p>One will accomplish [the mantras of] Jambhala,</p>
<p>Who, likewise, is said to be of the Jewel family. {30.11}</p>
<p>“On the ocean shore or the islands,</p>
<p>Everywhere near a [large] body of water,</p>
<p>And in the pleasant city of Laṅkā,</p>
<p>The [following] mantra deities can be accomplished: {30.12}</p>
<p>“Bhṛkuṭī, Tārā,</p>
<p>Mahāśriyā, Yaśasvinī,</p>
<p>All the mantras [of the goddess] called Sitā,</p>
<p>And the four Kumārīs [who live] in the great ocean.{30.13}</p>
<p>“They can be accomplished in these places</p>
<p>And everywhere in the east,</p>
<p>In the foothills of the Vindhyas,</p>
<p>And everywhere in the Himalayas.{30.14}</p>
<p>“[The mantras of] Kārttikeya and Mañjuśrī</p>
<p>Can be accomplished anywhere in places</p>
<p>Such as lovers’ hideouts, caves,</p>
<p>Mountains, and wild forests. {30.15}</p>
<p>“One can accomplish there [the mantras of] vināyakas</p>
<p>Who create obstacles for mantra reciters—</p>
<p>Powerful, single-tusked,</p>
<p>And furnished with a trunk— {30.16}</p>
<p>“And also [the mantras of] those with the form of a horse</p>
<p>And many other forms.</p>
<p>They are the divine sons of Īśāna</p>
<p>Who create various obstacles. {30.17}</p>
<p>“The places thus described are also noted</p>
<p>As the places of success for the mantras</p>
<p>Of the mātṛs in their various shapes</p>
<p>And the terrifying grahas. {30.18}</p>
<p>“[The beings] designated as pretas by birth,</p>
<p>Who feed on humans, [are associated with] the southwestern sector;</p>
<p>[The mantras of] the preta king are recommended for that quarter,</p>
<p>As it is the place where the corresponding accomplishments will arise. {30.19}</p>
<p>“It can also be recommended as the place of success</p>
<p>[In controlling] all the spirits.</p>
<p>[The mantras of] the valiant Vajrakrauñca</p>
<p>Will be successful in his quarter. {30.20}</p>
<p>“The main asura mantras</p>
<p>And other worldly mantras</p>
<p>Will be effective there.</p>
<p>The mantras belonging to the southern quarter {30.21}</p>
<p>“Are those of the king of the pretas</p>
<p>Known as Yama—they are recommended [for that quarter].</p>
<p>The authentic Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava mantras</p>
<p>Will also be effective [there].{30.22}</p>
<p>“When using cruel mantras in peaceful rites,</p>
<p>These places are not suitable.</p>
<p>For those who perform cruel rites,</p>
<p>The mantras of Vajrapāṇi are recommended.{30.23}</p>
<p>“The mantras of those who perform evil rites</p>
<p>Are effective in the south.</p>
<p>In that quarter will also be observed the arising</p>
<p>Of the [corresponding] nonvirtuous results.{30.24}</p>
<p>“The mantras taught to be of Āditya,</p>
<p>Those known to be of Soma,</p>
<p>And the mantras of Indra</p>
<p>Are effective in the western quarter, the auspicious.{30.25}</p>
<p>“The powerful lord of yakṣas himself</p>
<p>Will be accomplished there.</p>
<p>He grants wealth to all beings.</p>
<p>To the naive and foolish {30.26}</p>
<p>“He grants common sense.</p>
<p>[These gifts are] his ritual specialty.</p>
<p>This blissful fulfiller of aims</p>
<p>Can be accomplished in the west.</p>
<p>He is known here on earth</p>
<p>As Dhanada, the ‘wealth giver.’ {30.27}</p>
<p>“Vajrapāṇi, himself a yakṣa,</p>
<p>Is a bodhisattva of great magical power.</p>
<p>Chief among the mantra deities,</p>
<p>He is a master of the ten bodhisattva levels. {30.28}</p>
<p>“All the mantras—those that originate</p>
<p>In the Vajra and Lotus families</p>
<p>And those of all the eight families—</p>
<p>Belong to [their respective] eight quarters. {30.29}</p>
<p>“The mantras that originate from the Victorious One</p>
<p>Can be accomplished in the northern quarter.</p>
<p>Those that originate from the Lotus family</p>
<p>Can be accomplished in the eastern quarter. {30.30}</p>
<p>“The mantras that belong to the Vajra family</p>
<p>Can be accomplished in the southern quarter.</p>
<p>The Elephant family is said to be in the west,</p>
<p>And the Jewel family is at the intermediate point(s) of compass.</p>
<p>The junction between the western and the northern quarters</p>
<p>Is where the success of their [mantras] is said to belong.{30.31}</p>
<p>“At the junction between the western and southern quarters,</p>
<p>[The mantras of] the yakṣa family [can be accomplished],</p>
<p>And in the intermediate quarter between south and east,</p>
<p>[The mantras of] the powerful śrāvakas. {30.32}</p>
<p>“[The mantras] indicated by the family name</p>
<p>Will be effective in the places [as mentioned].</p>
<p>[The mantras] of the pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>Originate in the northeastern quarter.{30.33}</p>
<p>“[Wherever] in the world [a particular] family is highly esteemed,</p>
<p>In those places [its mantras] will be effective.</p>
<p>All the worldly mantras will be effective</p>
<p>In the world division below. {30.34}</p>
<p>“Thus, for entering the subterranean paradises,</p>
<p>The mantras of [all] the eight families will be effective.</p>
<p>There are also supramundane mantras—</p>
<p>They are the uṣṇīṣa mantras, and so forth. {30.35}</p>
<p>“Originating from the wheel-turning victors,</p>
<p>They can be accomplished in the world division above.</p>
<p>The mantras of the vajra holder</p>
<p>Are effective everywhere, in all world divisions.{30.36}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the other mantra-kings,</p>
<p>Such as all those that originate in the Lotus family,</p>
<p>Can all be accomplished everywhere.</p>
<p>The same is true for all the mantras that bring enjoyments and profit. {30.37}</p>
<p>“[The mantras] of the Vajra and Lotus families</p>
<p>Are effective throughout the entire period [indicated for them].</p>
<p>The recommended places have already been specified;</p>
<p>Now the time is being told: {30.38}</p>
<p>“The mantra accomplishments related to the victorious ones</p>
<p>Arise at [the time of] the arising of any buddha.</p>
<p>During the middle time of the buddhas,</p>
<p>The accomplishments related to the Lotus and Vajra families arise. {30.39}</p>
<p>“The mantras belonging to other families</p>
<p>Are accomplished at other times.</p>
<p>Their success depends on the right time;</p>
<p>It is said not to arise at other times. {30.40}</p>
<p>“The highest accomplishment comes from ardor;</p>
<p>It can be attained within three births.</p>
<p>However, those who recite the mantra continually,</p>
<p>Are mentally devoted to it, {30.41}</p>
<p>“And have faith in the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Can attain accomplishment even in this life.</p>
<p>If they have faith in the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>Are adorned with bodhicitta, {30.42}</p>
<p>“Observe the prescribed conduct, have great insight,</p>
<p>And have confidence in the tantras and mantras,</p>
<p>Their mantras will be accomplished without effort,</p>
<p>As they thus maintain the conduct of awakening. {30.43}</p>
<p>“Ordinary beings, [too], can accomplish their rites</p>
<p>And fulfill their specified individual aims.</p>
<p>The mantras can always be accomplished,</p>
<p>But not by beings who are deluded. {30.44}</p>
<p>“For this reason, the victorious ones</p>
<p>Have taught this king of manuals,</p>
<p>And so, [too], the seventh chief buddha</p>
<p>Teaches in detail its rituals and mantras.” {30.45}</p>
<p>The foremost among sages,</p>
<p>This majestic moon among buddhas,</p>
<p>Further said to the seniormost son of the buddhas,</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa of great splendor: {30.46}</p>
<p>“Listen, O divine youth, about the power of mantras</p>
<p>To manifest the highest destiny.</p>
<p>At the time when the buddhas, the guides of the world,</p>
<p>Are physically present, {30.47}</p>
<p>“At that time the accomplishment</p>
<p>Of uṣṇīṣa and other such mantras is noteworthy.</p>
<p>At that time King Cakravartin</p>
<p>And Tejorāśi become celebrated. {30.48}</p>
<p>“[Also,] Sitātapatra and Jayoṣṇīṣa</p>
<p>Are extolled by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>These and other uṣṇīṣa [kings]</p>
<p>Will be accomplished at that time. {30.49}</p>
<p>“At the time when the wheel turner</p>
<p>Is reborn in Jambūdvīpa</p>
<p>And remains there as the supreme among two-legged beings—</p>
<p>The Dharma king, the fully realized Buddha—</p>
<p>At that time all the mantra utterances</p>
<p>Will lead to accomplishment.” {30.50}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on the ritual restrictions concerning the place and the time [of accomplishing the mantras], thirtieth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 31</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and said to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Listen Mañjuśrī, divine youth, as I teach about the ways of spirits who possess other beings, and the accompanying auspicious and inauspicious signs.” {31.1}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, rose from his seat, prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One, folded his hands, and said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Good it is, O Blessed One! Please teach about the thoughts and actions (cittacaritāni) of beings who enter other beings’ bodies—the noble and divine siddhas, gandharvas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, piśācas, mahoragas, and so forth, and the human and nonhuman beings whose bodies are generated by different types of karma and who have taken different types of birth and have different forms and characteristics. Now it has come to pass, O Blessed One! Now it has come to pass, O Sugata, if you think that the time is right!” {31.2}</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, became silent. Having made his request, he now remained in his seat, waiting for Gautama, the supreme Victor, the guide of the world, the seventh of the victorious ones. Blessed Śākyamuni, for his part, taught the knowledge of the thoughts, actions, external aspects, and characteristics of such beings, and also the time when the possession occurs. {31.3}</p>
<p>“A being who entered the body of another</p>
<p>Can be drawn forth by the application of mantras.</p>
<p>Some such beings seize a human being on earth</p>
<p>Because of their desire for food. {31.4}</p>
<p>“Others do this because of their cruel disposition;</p>
<p>Others yet, because of previous enmity.</p>
<p>Very fearsome, they seize human beings</p>
<p>On the surface of the earth.{31.5}</p>
<p>“Others again, themselves free from desire</p>
<p>And bound by the pledge of compassion,</p>
<p>May descend into this world of mortals</p>
<p>And seize pure human beings. {31.6}</p>
<p>“Among people, those who are praiseworthy,</p>
<p>Pure, not deformed, and of clear complexion</p>
<p>Are taken possession of, it is said,</p>
<p>When the sun is rising. {31.7}</p>
<p>“On such an occasion, the descent occurs</p>
<p>In the evening when the sun sets,</p>
<p>Or during the first watch of the night,</p>
<p>When the moon is waxing. {31.8}</p>
<p>“Such a descent is known to occur for the mediums</p>
<p>Who are praiseworthy because of their pure actions,</p>
<p>Always live in accord with the Dharma,</p>
<p>And engage in virtuous and skillful pursuits. {31.9}</p>
<p>“If they are as described, mortals can be entered</p>
<p>By powerful beings who have extinguished their passions,</p>
<p>If the place and the person are pure</p>
<p>And the stars and nakṣatras are auspicious. {31.10}</p>
<p>“Their descent may be observed</p>
<p>On an auspicious day of the week</p>
<p>And an auspicious lunar day of the bright fortnight</p>
<p>Whose lunar asterism is governed by auspicious planets</p>
<p>And perfect conjunctions.</p>
<p>It can also occur when the moon is completely full. {31.11}</p>
<p>“When powerful, desire-free beings have thus descended,</p>
<p>They will be indicated by the following signs:</p>
<p>They will remain floating above the ground</p>
<p>At the height of a fan-palm tree. {31.12}</p>
<p>“They will appear sitting unsupported</p>
<p>In a cross-legged position,</p>
<p>Saying various divine and peerless words,</p>
<p>As pleasant to the ears as Brahmā’s. {31.13}</p>
<p>“These great beings will speak</p>
<p>About matters that cause them concern.</p>
<p>Drawn by the uṣṇīṣa mudrās,</p>
<p>They will come down to the ground. {31.14}</p>
<p>“One should wait for the moment before the great beings touch the ground,</p>
<p>And immediately present them with a welcome offering</p>
<p>Consisting of water mixed with flowers of royal jasmine,</p>
<p>White sandalwood, and saffron. {31.15}</p>
<p>“One should thus promptly offer</p>
<p>Water for the feet, prepared [as described].</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner should prostrate themself on the ground</p>
<p>And, motivated by kindness, should supplicate the great beings, {31.16}</p>
<p>“Who, for their part,</p>
<p>Without any selfishness,</p>
<p>Will say divine words</p>
<p>With a pure voice pleasant to the ears. {31.17}</p>
<p>“One who knows the mantras with confidence</p>
<p>Should ask them whatever one wants.</p>
<p>One should not be afraid at this time,</p>
<p>But remember Mañjughoṣa. {31.18}</p>
<p>“Forming the mudrā five-crested,</p>
<p>Or another one that arises from the uṣṇīṣa,</p>
<p>One should bind the directions,</p>
<p>Including the ones above and below. {31.19}</p>
<p>“The great beings will then tell everything</p>
<p>From the middle to the end,</p>
<p>And from the beginning to the middle,</p>
<p>Truthfully, about the past, the future, {31.20}</p>
<p>“And the present, as it really is.</p>
<p>Such splendorous beings will express it.</p>
<p>With unblinking eyes and without moving,</p>
<p>They will look on without fear or hatred.{31.21}</p>
<p>“Whatever they say is true</p>
<p>And will not turn out to be otherwise.</p>
<p>Regarding accomplishing what is to be accomplished,</p>
<p>Whether it is power substances, the course of rebirth, the destinies, {31.22}</p>
<p>“Or the attainment of pratyeka­buddhahood, bodhisattvahood,</p>
<p>Arhatship, or the great awakening, it will inevitably come to pass.</p>
<p>Similarly, they will correctly ascertain the buddha family</p>
<p>Or the bodhisattva lineage.{31.23}</p>
<p>“The period without the Buddha lineage</p>
<p>And the powerful beings in the future —</p>
<p>All this they will truthfully describe,</p>
<p>Indicating also the time of their occurrence.</p>
<p>The practitioner should speak, taking advantage of the moment,</p>
<p>And not wait for another occasion. {31.24}</p>
<p>“Whatever one requests at that particular moment,</p>
<p>Motivated by good intentions,</p>
<p>Will all be swiftly obtained—</p>
<p>In particular, the mantra accomplishment.</p>
<p>One will obtain all good fortune</p>
<p>According to one’s desires and hopes. {31.25}</p>
<p>“Having requested the great beings to depart</p>
<p>With a prompt offering that is agreeable to them,</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner should perform</p>
<p>The bowl protection rite, following the prescribed procedure. {31.26}</p>
<p>“One should place the collapsed body</p>
<p>On a bed on the ground,</p>
<p>And employ the mantra as taught by the victorious ones</p>
<p>In conjunction with the uṣṇīṣa mudrā. {31.27}</p>
<p>“Using this mudrā, or the five-crested,</p>
<p>One should perform the protection rite.</p>
<p>Then the being left behind on the ground</p>
<p>Will become well in their body. {31.28}</p>
<p>“This protection is prescribed</p>
<p>For all possessed beings.</p>
<p>Evil beings will not then be able</p>
<p>To harm those used as such vessels.</p>
<p>This protection is indeed great</p>
<p>For people who become vessels. {31.29}</p>
<p>“If the words of the [medium] are heard in midair,</p>
<p>And the language is that known in Madhyadeśa,</p>
<p>It indicates that [the possessing being] is of divine birth,</p>
<p>From the Akaniṣṭha or other heavens in the realm of form.</p>
<p>Other signs indicating their origin</p>
<p>In the realm of form will also be observed. {31.30}</p>
<p>“For the lords of the desire realm,</p>
<p>Ruling over the gods of this realm,</p>
<p>The signs will indicate their [relatively] inferior birth,</p>
<p>And their speech will be very sweet. {31.31}</p>
<p>“If they are divine yakṣas dwelling in palaces</p>
<p>Manifested here on earth,</p>
<p>The language of these yakṣas will be the same</p>
<p>As that of Vārāṇasī along with Magadha. {31.32}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the language of Aṅga</p>
<p>Is known to be that of mahoragas.</p>
<p>The language of Pūrvī</p>
<p>Is that of the powerful garuḍas. {31.33}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the same language</p>
<p>That is spoken in Vaṅga</p>
<p>Is also known to be the speech of kinnaras,</p>
<p>And, as such, indicates them [as the possessing beings]. {31.34}</p>
<p>“The language of Oḍra is invariably</p>
<p>That of the sword-wielding siddhas, the masters of magic.</p>
<p>This language of the vidyādharas</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .{31.35}</p>
<p>“The language of Kāmarūpa is the language</p>
<p>Of the sages who can assume any form.</p>
<p>It indicates that [the possessing beings]</p>
<p>Are the sages with the five superknowledges. {31.36}</p>
<p>“The language of Samataṭa</p>
<p>And the language of Harikela</p>
<p>Are based on the sound ḍ</p>
<p>And are indistinct and unclear.{31.37}</p>
<p>“Languages where the sound l abounds</p>
<p>Are said to be piśāca.</p>

<p>Of Karmaraṅga, Nārikela, {31.38}</p>
<p>“Vāruṣaka,</p>

<p>“Indistinct languages where</p>
<p>The sound r abounds,</p>
<p>Both wispy and harsh,</p>
<p>Are spoken by the angry pretas. {31.40}</p>

<p>Among the inhabitants of Andhra,</p>
<p>Karnāṭaka, Drāviḍa, Kośala, Aḍavi,</p>
<p>And on the island of Siṃhala. {31.41}</p>
<p>“Languages that abound in the sound ḍ,</p>
<p>In combination with the guttural ra, are known as rākṣasa.</p>
<p>They are spoken by people</p>
<p>Inhabiting other islands.{31.42}</p>
<p>“The language of the mātṛs of great vigor</p>
<p>Is the same as the one just described;</p>
<p>The languages that indicate [these mātṛs as the possessing beings]</p>
<p>Are the western languages of Vidiśa and Mālava.{31.43}</p>
<p>“If the language [spoken by the medium]</p>
<p>Is recognized as that of Vatsa­matsārṇava,</p>
<p>Śūrasena, Daśārṇava,</p>
<p>The hilly Śrīkaṇṭha, or Gurjara, {31.44}</p>
<p>“This indicates that [the possessing beings]</p>
<p>Are the chief grahas, Āditya and so forth.</p>
<p>If the language is recognized as that of Pāriyātra,</p>
<p>[The possessing beings] are other grahas.{31.45}</p>
<p>“If the languages resemble those spoken</p>
<p>By the mountain dwellers in Arbuda, Sahya, or Malaya,</p>
<p>Or those spoken by the inhabitants</p>
<p>Of Khaṣadroṇi,{31.46}</p>
<p>“They indicate that [the possessing beings]</p>
<p>Are kuṣmāṇḍas and so forth.</p>
<p>These languages are based on the sounds</p>
<p>Śa, ra, ṣa, and sa; and ya, ra, la, and va. {31.47}</p>
<p>“Languages abounding in the sound gha</p>
<p>Indicate that [the possessing beings] are dānavas.</p>
<p>Such languages are found</p>
<p>In the countries of Kaśmīra and Kāviśa. {31.48}</p>
<p>“All languages originate from the buddha families,</p>
<p>[And the previously mentioned] belong to the family of Vajrapāṇi.</p>
<p>For each of the main mantras</p>
<p>There is one language that suits the best.{31.49}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the Lotus family belongs in Madhyadeśa,</p>
<p>[And the languages there] originate from this family.</p>
<p>These languages, along with the outward manner of acting</p>
<p>[Of the medium], will indicate an origin from the Lotus family. {31.50}</p>
<p>“It has been explained earlier [how] to recognize</p>
<p>[The possessing beings] as the sons of victors;</p>
<p>The signs that betoken their freedom from desire</p>
<p>Belong to [the family of] the victorious ones. {31.51}</p>
<p>“The manner of acting [of the medium] will be particular</p>
<p>To the place where the language [they use] comes from.</p>
<p>This alone will indicate the [type of] the possessing being,</p>
<p>As a sign that reveals everything. {31.52}</p>
<p>“The languages of the people living</p>
<p>In the foothills of the Himalayas</p>
<p>North of the river Gaṅgā</p>
<p>Indicate the yakṣas, gandharvas, and ṛṣis.{31.53}</p>
<p>“[The languages of] the people living in the foothills</p>
<p>Of the Vindhya Mountains south of the Gaṅgā,</p>
<p>As well as of those who live</p>
<p>In the Śrīparvata Mountains, {31.54}</p>
<p>“Indicate the rākṣasas, ostārakas, pretas,</p>
<p>The misshapen mātṛs,</p>
<p>The great vighnas with terrible forms,</p>
<p>And the fearsome grahas. {31.55}</p>
<p>“[The languages spoken by these] greedy stealers of the others’ life force</p>
<p>Derive from the languages of the people just mentioned.</p>
<p>The signs that indicate the country</p>
<p>Include the mode of acting particular to that country. {31.56}</p>
<p>“The evil beings that speak these languages</p>
<p>Express themselves through the possessed mediums.</p>
<p>There are many such beings—those [mentioned] and others</p>
<p>That act in manners consistent with their modes of existence. {31.57}</p>
<p>“They have many different forms</p>
<p>And many different characteristics.</p>
<p>The different types of [possessing] beings</p>
<p>Each have their respective type of birth. {31.58}</p>
<p>“The symptoms observed in the possessed medium</p>
<p>Thus indicate the type [of the possessing being].</p>
<p>One should truly endeavor to</p>
<p>Bring happiness to all people. {31.59}</p>
<p>“For protection, one should employ [the mantras]</p>
<p>Of the divine youth who is the origin of everything.</p>
<p>The mantra reciter can do this</p>
<p>By means of the six-syllable mantra. {31.60}</p>
<p>“Used in combination with the great mudrā</p>
<p>And placed upon the five locks of hair,</p>
<p>This mantra will afford great protection.”{31.61}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter with instructions on the procedure to be applied based on the symptoms [observed] in the possessed [person], thirty-first in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 32</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth: {32.1}</p>
<p>“Your mantras, Mañjuśrī, hold the key to the complete understanding of all the tantras; they possess the secrets of all the vidyās, and, in consequence, they can also cause the ripening of all the results of good qualities accumulated over a long period of time. I will now authoritatively teach the factors of accomplishment, which are as follows: {32.2}</p>
<p>“As time is not its primary cause,</p>
<p>Accomplishment can arise in another life.</p>
<p>The governing principle is rather that it arises</p>
<p>Subject to previously created causes. {32.3}</p>
<p>“One who lacks benefits can attain accomplishment</p>
<p>Through correctly ascertaining the right means.</p>
<p>The means attested as right for all beings</p>
<p>Is to resort to you, the divine youth.{32.4}</p>
<p>“What is here called the right means</p>
<p>Is the ritual activity performed in advance.</p>
<p>One who is steadfastly engaged in this way</p>
<p>Will obtain the supreme accomplishment. {32.5}</p>
<p>“Ritual activity accomplishes that which has not been accomplished;</p>
<p>There is no accomplishment without ritual activity.</p>
<p>There must be the activity and its agent—</p>
<p>When these are present, accomplishment will be achieved. {32.6}</p>
<p>“One will obtain the highest level</p>
<p>Through applying the right procedure.</p>
<p>When the mantra practitioner does not say the mantra,</p>
<p>Even what is not the mantra will become a mantra.{32.7}</p>
<p>“By observing the ritual conduct of silence,</p>
<p>One will win complete accomplishment.</p>
<p>Through withholding his semen,</p>
<p>The practitioner will obtain supreme intelligence. {32.8}</p>
<p>“When passing away, one will obtain the ‘first destiny’</p>
<p>At the best possible location.</p>
<p>As for the condition of one who thus passes away,</p>
<p>One will become healthy and will never get old.{32.9}</p>
<p>“If one desires accomplishment,</p>
<p>But the signs indicate that the time is not right,</p>
<p>One will not accomplish the mantras,</p>
<p>Even if one is Śakra himself. {32.10}</p>
<p>“Moreover, one’s endeavors are ill-timed</p>
<p>If one does not benefit spirits and people.</p>
<p>No accomplishment will manifest for such a one,</p>
<p>Even if he is a high-minded brahmin. {32.11}</p>
<p>“If one is lazy, full of cravings,</p>
<p>Arrogant, proud,</p>
<p>Loose of tongue,</p>
<p>And always delights in vulgar company,</p>
<p>Is slothful, and indulges in sex,</p>
<p>How will he obtain accomplishment? {32.12}</p>
<p>“Even the most prominent gods,</p>
<p>Or the most prominent asuras,</p>
<p>Will not be able to accomplish the mantra</p>
<p>If they fail to follow the procedure.</p>
<p>A rite without the right procedure</p>
<p>Only causes the mind to wander. {32.13}</p>
<p>“If beings recite unsuitable mantras,</p>
<p>Violating the right procedure,</p>
<p>Such mantras will produce</p>
<p>Deluded views in those naive beings. {32.14}</p>
<p>“These ignorant, senseless beings</p>
<p>Will end up in the most miserable state of existence.</p>
<p>The mantra holders will subsequently rescue them though,</p>
<p>And set them free again. {32.15}</p>
<p>“In stages, they will obtain accomplishment</p>
<p>And a pleasant state of existence.</p>
<p>The mantras will thus establish</p>
<p>Such reciters in an unshakable state of bliss. {32.16}</p>
<p>“The tathāgatas have thus taught</p>
<p>Mantra recitation that never fails.</p>
<p>Even if one has strayed from the right view,</p>
<p>One will be the object of their kindness. {32.17}</p>
<p>“There are spiritual friends,</p>
<p>And there are their dear children—ordinary beings.</p>
<p>For the latter, accomplishments have been taught</p>
<p>Consistent with the three vehicles. {32.18}</p>
<p>“One should therefore recite the mantra</p>
<p>In all earnestness and fully concentrated.</p>
<p>If the reciters employ the mantras</p>
<p>Apart from the prescribed rituals, {32.19}</p>
<p>“It will take them a long time</p>
<p>Before they are liberated from saṃsāra;</p>
<p>A long time will pass before one sees</p>
<p>The accomplishment of such mantras. {32.20}</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, the mantras are employed according to procedure,</p>
<p>One will swiftly obtain accomplishment</p>
<p>And will see the results manifesting in full—</p>
<p>Such mantras are said to be not without results. {32.21}</p>
<p>“Such mantras will be accomplished in this very life,</p>
<p>With the corresponding results arising accordingly.</p>
<p>Without the result-oriented rite there will be no fruition;</p>
<p>The rite that does not produce results is useless.{32.22}</p>
<p>“The rite is called attended by results</p>
<p>When the ritual performance produces results.</p>
<p>The reciter of such [rites] will, in this life,</p>
<p>Attain the deathless state{32.23}</p>
<p>“[Where] the world is said to be blissful,</p>
<p>And [the reciter] is delivered into a tranquil state.</p>
<p>Such a follower of the Buddha’s path</p>
<p>Will enter there, the great destiny. {32.24}</p>
<p>“During the inauspicious lowest eon,</p>
<p>He will see his own accomplishment.</p>
<p>In this very life he will obtain accomplishment</p>
<p>That will last beyond the end of this life. {32.25}</p>
<p>“Until the final liberation there will be peace—</p>
<p>This is the unconditioned, auspicious path.</p>
<p>It has been explained to the world</p>
<p>As the pure, auspicious state. {32.26}</p>
<p>“The victorious ones taught about buddhahood,</p>
<p>Explaining everything in full.</p>
<p>At the end of such teaching, and only then,</p>
<p>They taught the accomplishment of mantras. {32.27}</p>
<p>“When the victorious ones are absent,</p>
<p>Without manifesting individually,</p>
<p>[For such times] the powerful, moon-like sages</p>
<p>Taught the mantras to the world.{32.28}</p>
<p>“It is taught that accomplishment can manifest for beings</p>
<p>As a real experience during this life.</p>
<p>When the knower of reality is absent,</p>
<p>One can attain buddhahood by means of mantras. {32.29}</p>
<p>“During the final time period, the dark eon,</p>
<p>When the knower of reality has departed into the peace [of nirvāṇa],</p>
<p>The mantras of those who [merely] desire wealth</p>
<p>Will not be accomplished quickly. {32.30}</p>
<p>“At that time, however, if an adept of the mantra system</p>
<p>Performs the ritual according to procedure,</p>
<p>He will [swiftly] become accomplished</p>
<p>In the doctrine taught by the Sage.{32.31}</p>
<p>“When a tathāgata is physically present,</p>
<p>The supreme accomplishment can be expected [to arise] swiftly.</p>
<p>In the intermediate period,</p>
<p>The middling accomplishment is said [to arise]. {32.32}</p>
<p>“Toward the end of the eon,</p>
<p>The accomplishment is said to be inferior.</p>
<p>For the auspicious period of the eon,</p>
<p>Which is like flying in the empty sky, {32.33}</p>
<p>“The guides of the world predicted</p>
<p>The accomplishment of all the mantras.</p>
<p>At that time, one can accomplish</p>
<p>The chief family of the victorious ones. {32.34}</p>
<p>“During the intermediate period, one can accomplish the Lotus family;</p>
<p>Toward the end of the eon, one can accomplish the Vajra family.</p>
<p>The mantras that are subject to the power of [former] aspirations</p>
<p>Can be accomplished in any time period. {32.35}</p>
<p>“[The mantras of] Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Tārā, Bhṛkuṭī, the king of yakṣas,</p>
<p>And all the yakṣa-followers of Māṇicara</p>
<p>Can, likewise, be accomplished in any period. {32.36}</p>
<p>“The mantras and other [such tools] that cater to desires</p>
<p>Are employed by all the [worldly] deities.</p>
<p>These mantras, distinctly branded as worldly,</p>
<p>Are accomplished during the dark eon. {32.37}</p>
<p>“They are disseminated by gods and men;</p>
<p>By the dānava lords, yakṣas, rākṣasas,</p>
<p>Ṛṣis, garuḍas, piśācas,</p>
<p>Bhūtas, gaṇas, and grahas; {32.38}</p>
<p>“By both human and nonhuman beings</p>
<p>Who inhabit the realm of desire;</p>
<p>By the powerful beings endowed with merit</p>
<p>And by those who fearsomely engage in cruel activities; {32.39}</p>
<p>“And by Śakra, Brahmā, Rudra,</p>
<p>Īśāna, and others.</p>
<p>Powerful mantras are taught</p>
<p>By Viṣṇu and all the bhūtas. {32.40}</p>
<p>“These mantras can be accomplished by reciters</p>
<p>Toward the end of this lowest eon.</p>
<p>At this dreadful time</p>
<p>Cruel rites are accomplished. {32.41}</p>
<p>“However, accomplishment in the enthrallment</p>
<p>And the forced summons of spirits who feed on flesh</p>
<p>Is seen as useless on earth and is censured</p>
<p>In the world beyond. {32.42}</p>
<p>“For this reason, the victorious lord</p>
<p>Recommended for this dreadful time</p>
<p>The teachings of Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Wholly devoted to the welfare of beings. {32.43}</p>
<p>“In the form of mantras,</p>
<p>He will destroy, at that time, evil beings,</p>
<p>If the reciters [of these mantras] have faith in this teaching</p>
<p>And worship the Three Jewels.” {32.44}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on the ritual procedures and the rules pertaining to [the particular] time periods, thirty-second in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,”  an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 33</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows: {33.1}</p>
<p>“Your king of manuals, Mañjuśrī, styled as a nirdeśa, is a treasury of the sphere of phenomena, as it proceeds from the sphere of phenomena, which is the essence of the tathāgatas. This great sūtra, precious as a jewel, is divided into detailed sections. It is sanctioned [to teach] the greatest secrets of the tathāgatas and brings accomplishment of the supreme mantras. It contains auxiliary practices pertaining to the knowledge of signs and the rules for ascertaining the right time. [It also explains] the voices of all the [different] beings, differentiating the sounds made by sentient and insentient entities. {33.2}</p>
<p>“There is an [aspect of] knowledge called verbal,</p>
<p>And another is proclaimed to be non-verbal.</p>
<p>There is also one that is mixed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the application of mantras is threefold.{33.3}</p>
<p>“Mantras composed of divine words</p>
<p>Are employed for impermanent goals.</p>
<p>Always free expressions that are not grammatical,</p>
<p>They are each adorned with conceptual meanings.{33.4}</p>
<p>“The noble mantras are attested</p>
<p>Within the entire siddhānta.</p>
<p>As for the mantras that are devoid of lexical meaning,</p>
<p>They are always divided into three. {33.5}</p>
<p>“A mantra can also be adorned with phonemes</p>
<p>That are either heavy, light, or medium.</p>
<p>Such a mantra-queen would be adorned</p>
<p>With vowels that are metrically arranged. {33.6}</p>
<p>“The speech can be refined or not,</p>
<p>Or, as the others put it, it can be with or without lexical meaning.</p>
<p>By employing the meanings of verbal roots</p>
<p>The mantras become adorned with a graspable meaning. {33.7}</p>
<p>“The language of such mantras</p>
<p>Is full of concepts and is entirely worldly;</p>
<p>Such speech may be metrical and accented</p>
<p>And consist of just one or two syllables.{33.8}</p>
<p>“The efficacy of [the mantras of]</p>
<p>Three, four, five, six, seven,</p>
<p>Eight, nine, or ten syllables</p>
<p>Is [also] well established. {33.9}</p>
<p>“[These] ten source syllables,</p>
<p>Expressed by means of ten letters,</p>
<p>Can be multiplied, here on earth,</p>
<p>Up to ten times.{33.10}</p>
<p>“[Mantras] may [thus] consist of one hundred,</p>
<p>Twenty, or just one syllable.</p>
<p>Mantras are composed to include</p>
<p>These standard syllables. {33.11}</p>
<p>“The mantras that contain four pādas</p>
<p>Will accomplish all aims.</p>
<p>The most excellent and best mantras</p>
<p>Are those taught by the victorious ones. {33.12}</p>
<p>“But there are also mantras</p>
<p>That are middling or inferior;</p>
<p>Of these two types, the middling ones are taught</p>
<p>By the sons of the victorious ones. {33.13}</p>
<p>“As for the inferior mantras,</p>
<p>They are taught by any worldly person.</p>
<p>The mantras described as debased</p>
<p>Are those taught by the demons. {33.14}</p>
<p>“The victorious ones described</p>
<p>As standard the mantras of ten, eight,</p>
<p>Seven, and twenty [syllables]and so forth,</p>
<p>Until well over one hundred.{33.15}</p>
<p>“The number of syllables</p>
<p>That is the norm in the mantras</p>
<p>Taught by the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Could be just one or two, or five hundred. {33.16}</p>
<p>“The composition of a mantra is said to be</p>
<p>An arrangement of words that consist of syllables.</p>
<p>Meters depend on [metrical units that each] contain a vowel.</p>
<p>[Mantras] are adorned with the individual meanings of verbal roots. {33.17}</p>
<p>“[Mantric] speech should be recited well,</p>
<p>In a manner that follows tantric [principles].</p>
<p>How would accomplishment ever arise</p>
<p>If [mantras] were without word-sounds? {33.18}</p>
<p>“Combining mudrās with words that contain retroflex sounds,</p>
<p>Followed by the palatal and ending with the ‘hot’ sounds,</p>
<p>And producing dental, labial, and guttural sounds—</p>
<p>So is the sādhana performed.{33.19}</p>
<p>“One should avoid indistinct pronunciation</p>
<p>And recite the mantras correctly.</p>
<p>One who pronounces the words fully and correctly,</p>
<p>Observing the right prosody, will succeed. {33.20}</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, one strays from the right procedure,</p>
<p>Neglects the ritual performance, and misses the word meanings,</p>
<p>One’s mantras will not be accomplished soon;</p>
<p>One may expect this to take a long time. {33.21}</p>
<p>“The accomplishment of a reciter who does not recite</p>
<p>Merely for show, will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Even in their next life, they will see the boons and blessings</p>
<p>Of their mantra accomplishment. {33.22}</p>
<p>“Because of the power of the mantras</p>
<p>Of such long-term reciters,</p>
<p>Their rites, attended by these mantras, will be fruitful,</p>
<p>Since they are mantra adepts.{33.23}</p>
<p>“The lowest of all mantras</p>
<p>Are the worldly mantras of humans,</p>
<p>The mantras taught by any of the spirits,</p>
<p>And the mantras that cater to one’s greed.</p>
<p>They are said to include cerebralized letters—</p>
<p>One, two, or three of them.{33.24}</p>
<p>“Various foreign languages,</p>
<p>Known to be spoken in [particular] countries,</p>
<p>Have a linear structure,</p>
<p>With the sounds arranged in a line—</p>
<p>One thousand and eight, one hundred and eight,</p>
<p>And down to a single letter.{33.25}</p>
<p>“The speech may be in prose or in verse,</p>
<p>Such as four pādas long, or just half a pāda.</p>
<p>The verse could also be of the daṇḍaka type, measured in syllables,</p>
<p>Or an extended, ‘shallow,’ skandhaka type, measured in mātras.{33.26}</p>
<p>“[The speech,] endowed with meaning word by word,</p>
<p>Is thus adorned with thousands of meanings.</p>
<p>If the words, whether Sanskrit or Apabhraṃśa,</p>
<p>Are devoid of meaning— {33.27}</p>
<p>“If they are pronounced indistinctly,</p>
<p>Or lack the metrical rhythm—</p>
<p>It is said, when describing the accomplishment of such mantras,</p>
<p>That it has no function or place.{33.28}</p>
<p>“The following characteristics apply to all mantras.</p>
<p>The mantras with multiple occurrences of the syllable śa,</p>
<p>Adorned by the import of the syllable oṁ,</p>
<p>And containing the syllable ta that indicates their belonging to the tantra</p>
<p>Are certain to bring accomplishment.{33.29}</p>
<p>“If the mantras that start with oṁ</p>
<p>And end with m</p>
<p>Also contain the syllable śa,</p>
<p>They are auspicious and will bring results. {33.30}</p>
<p>“Mantras with the form of a square containing the syllable ta</p>
<p>That are not contracted at the end,</p>
<p>And where the syllable ta is joined with the letter r,</p>
<p>Are effective in ritual performances.</p>
<p>The letter r occurring twice or many times at the beginning</p>
<p>Will bring out good qualities of the syllable huṁ.{33.31}</p>
<p>“When the syllable va is at the end of the square,</p>
<p>The letters [of the mantra] will render the sādhana effective.</p>
<p>The syllable ka may be joined with the letter r,</p>
<p>And the syllable ma at the end become merely an m.</p>
<p>Mantras that begin with the syllables ma or na</p>
<p>Are said to be the best. {33.32}</p>
<p>“Mantras that have many syllables ta</p>
<p>Can be found in all the tantras;</p>
<p>They are said to be associated with the north.</p>
<p>Those associated with the south are adorned with huṁ.</p>
<p>Those that have many syllables bha</p>
<p>Are associated with the east and the northwest. {33.33}</p>
<p>“The syllable ca belongs to Varuṇa;</p>
<p>It is said to nourish and bring welfare to the world.</p>
<p>The mantra that has many syllables va</p>
<p>Is regarded as belonging to the great Indra.{33.34}</p>
<p>“If it starts with a recourse to the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>The mantra is one of refuge.</p>
<p>If it includes, further on, an homage,</p>
<p>It is the cause of peace and brings happiness. {33.35}</p>
<p>“Otherwise, a mantra may be used</p>
<p>For paying homage to all the gods.</p>
<p>One’s own mantra and also the ‘lord of mantras’</p>
<p>Are suitable for all types of activity. {33.36}</p>
<p>“Mantras that contain many syllables ḍa,</p>
<p>And end with the syllable phaṭ [preceded by] huṁ,</p>
<p>Are very cruel ones;</p>
<p>They have great intensity and power. {33.37}</p>
<p>“They instantly block [the target’s] life force</p>
<p>And may be skillfully employed [to target] cruel beings,</p>
<p>Especially those that commit evil;</p>
<p>They should not be used against any others.{33.38}</p>
<p>“The reciter should always avoid</p>
<p>Those things that are avoided by the sages.</p>
<p>The mantras of pacifying and nourishing</p>
<p>Will accomplish both [one’s own and others’] interests. {33.39}</p>
<p>“They can accomplish all the rites,</p>
<p>Whatever have been taught.</p>
<p>When they are recited the right way,</p>
<p>Mantras possess energy and magical abilities. {33.40}</p>
<p>“One should perform rites of pacifying</p>
<p>Using the mantras taught by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>For all the rites of nourishing,</p>
<p>One should use the mantras of the Jewel family. {33.41}</p>
<p>“All evil rites are employed</p>
<p>In the activities of assault.</p>
<p>All rites of assault should be performed</p>
<p>Using the mantras of the Vajra family.</p>
<p>Though forbidden by the lords of the world,</p>
<p>Such mantras have been taught by the lord of yakṣas.{33.42}</p>
<p>“The mantras, in all their greatness,</p>
<p>Manifest in order to guide sentient beings.</p>
<p>They are said to be of three types,</p>
<p>Always belonging to [one of] the three families. {33.43}</p>
<p>“As for the eight families</p>
<p>Enumerated by the Sage himself,</p>
<p>The accomplishment in them is threefold,</p>
<p>As it arises in three different ways—</p>
<p>Supreme, middling, or inferior.</p>
<p>This is its threefold division. {33.44}</p>
<p>“It can be of a peaceful,</p>
<p>Nourishing, or cruel type.</p>
<p>This is taught exclusively</p>
<p>In the context of mantra and tantra. {33.45}</p>
<p>“When the exalted function of mantras</p>
<p>Is utilized in the activity of assault,</p>
<p>Such rites are debased</p>
<p>And condemned by all the omniscient ones. {33.46}</p>
<p>“Even when one is in trouble, one must not perform</p>
<p>Any rite that interrupts the life force [of the target].</p>
<p>The magnitude of the karma incurred</p>
<p>Is described here only briefly: {33.47}</p>
<p>“The karmic consequences of mantras</p>
<p>Employed in tantric procedures are far reaching and extensive.</p>
<p>This has been taught in this king of manuals</p>
<p>And can also be found in other tantras. {33.48}</p>
<p>“Although one may be able to use any mantra,</p>
<p>One should not perform inferior rites.</p>
<p>Whatever worldly mantras there are,</p>
<p>They are all of dubious benefit. {33.49}</p>
<p>“All the supramundane mantras, on the other hand,</p>
<p>Are always endowed with good qualities.</p>
<p>The mantra accomplishments are infinite,</p>
<p>As they are proclaimed to be. {33.50}</p>
<p>“The count begins from one,</p>
<p>But, similarly, twenty are described.</p>
<p>Then thirty, if put briefly,</p>
<p>And after that, forty. {33.51}</p>
<p>“Next is sixty—[a number] divisible by three.</p>
<p>With an extra ten, it becomes seventy.</p>
<p>If another ten is added,</p>
<p>The number, they say, is eighty. {33.52}</p>
<p>“If another ten is added, the number is called ninety,</p>
<p>And with another ten, it is a full one hundred.</p>
<p>One hundred now being the base for counting,</p>
<p>Ten of these makes one thousand. {33.53}</p>
<p>“Ten thousands is one ayuta;</p>
<p>Ten ayutas is one lakh.</p>
<p>Ten lakhs is one vilakh (one million),</p>
<p>And ten of these is one koṭi (ten million). {33.54}</p>
<p>“Ten koṭis is one vikoṭi (one hundred million),</p>
<p>And ten of the latter is one arbuda (one billion).</p>
<p>Ten arbudas is one nirbuda (ten billion),</p>
<p>And ten of these is, as expected, one khaḍga (one hundred billion). {33.55}</p>
<p>“Ten khaḍgas is one nikhaḍga (one trillion),</p>
<p>And ten nikhaḍgas is, as expected, one kharva (ten trillion).</p>
<p>Ten kharvas is one padma (one hundred trillion),</p>
<p>And ten padmas is one mahāpadma (one quadrillion). {33.56}</p>
<p>“Ten mahāpadmas is one vāha (ten quadrillion);</p>
<p>Ten of these is one vivāha (one hundred quadrillion).</p>
<p>The next after that is known as mahāvivāha (one quintillion),</p>
<p>And ten of these is called māya (ten quintillion). {33.57}</p>
<p>“Ten māyas is one mahāmāya (one hundred quintillion);</p>
<p>Mahāmāya, after another multiplication by ten,</p>
<p>Is termed by the guides of the world samudrā (one sextillion),</p>
<p>As [known] in the science of algebra. {33.58}</p>
<p>“The next number, after the multiplication</p>
<p>By the ‘half of twenty,’ is mahāsamudrā (ten sextillion);</p>
<p>Mahāsamudrā, when multiplied by ten,</p>
<p>Is called sāgara (one hundred sextillion). {33.59}</p>
<p>“When multiplied by the ‘half of twenty,’</p>
<p>It becomes mahāsāgara (one septillion);</p>
<p>The latter, multiplied by ten,</p>
<p>Is called pragharā (ten septillion). {33.60}</p>
<p>“Ten pragharās, as they are called,</p>
<p>Are proclaimed to be one gharā (one hundred septillion);</p>
<p>Ten of the so-called gharās</p>
<p>Are said to be one aśeṣa (one octillion). {33.61}</p>
<p>“Aśeṣa, multiplied by the ‘half of twenty,’</p>
<p>Becomes mahāśeṣa (ten octillion).</p>
<p>This, according to the guides of the world,</p>
<p>Is the limit beyond which a number is incomputable. {33.62}</p>
<p>“Counting is said to rely on multiplying by ten,</p>
<p>But then, it is an incomputable number that is multiplied.</p>
<p>Multiplying an incomputable number by ten</p>
<p>Gives a number even more incomputable.{33.63}</p>
<p>“This world is proclaimed to be multiplied</p>
<p>A thousandfold infinite number of times.</p>
<p>The cosmic unit next to this world</p>
<p>Is a great world, which is manifolded further. {33.64}</p>
<p>“Beyond that, there is the so-called darkness,</p>
<p>And beyond that, the so-called light.</p>
<p>After light is the so-called great light,</p>
<p>And when this is multiplied, it is called multitude.{33.65}</p>
<p>“After the multitude is the so-called great multitude,</p>
<p>And after the great multitude is one called the deep.</p>
<p>After the deep is one called the stable,</p>
<p>And after the stable comes the more stable. {33.66}</p>
<p>“Beyond that is the abundant,</p>
<p>And beyond the abundant, the basis.</p>
<p>According to those who delight in the art of enumeration,</p>
<p>Beyond the basis is the more basic. {33.67}</p>
<p>“After that comes the great basis,</p>
<p>And the one after the great basis is known as the fixed.</p>
<p>When we have moved from the fixed to the more fixed,</p>
<p>The next [on the list] is known as the great thing.{33.68}</p>
<p>“After the great thing there is the famous basis,</p>
<p>And after that comes the great ocean.</p>
<p>After the great ocean is one called the primal,</p>
<p>And after the primal is the more primal. {33.69}</p>
<p>“The one after the [more] primal is called excellent,</p>
<p>And the one after the excellent, the most excellent.</p>
<p>After the [most] excellent is one called dwelling place,</p>
<p>And after the dwelling place, one known as the inconceivable. {33.70}</p>
<p>“[After] the inconceivable there is the terrible;</p>
<p>[After that,] the terrible, the kingdom.</p>
<p>Beyond the kingdom is the home of the treasure,</p>
<p>And beyond that is the virtuous. {33.71}</p>
<p>“Beyond the virtuous is the great mind,</p>
<p>And the next after that is the no-mind.</p>
<p>After the no-mind is the confused mind,</p>
<p>And after that is what is called expressible. {33.72}</p>
<p>“After the expressible is the inexpressible.</p>
<p>Next is one called the universal,</p>
<p>And after the universal is the great universal.</p>
<p>Next is one called asvara.{33.73}</p>
<p>“After the asvara is the place of the great asvara,</p>
<p>After which there is the kharva.</p>
<p>The place auspicious peace is so called</p>
<p>By those who have reached the limit of enumeration. {33.74}</p>
<p>“After the very courageous is the courageous,</p>
<p>And then one called the watery.</p>
<p>After the watery is the confused mind,</p>
<p>And after that, another place [called] the ultimate. {33.75}</p>
<p>“Beyond the ultimate is the domain of the buddhas,</p>
<p>With its superior levels.</p>
<p>It is impossible for human beings to</p>
<p>Go over all these world divisions. {33.76}</p>
<p>“There is nothing that would be regarded</p>
<p>As superior to the domain of the buddhas.</p>
<p>Buddhafields are believed</p>
<p>To be as numerous as the grains of sand in the Gaṅgā. {33.77}</p>
<p>“Dissecting [the physical matter,]</p>
<p>The guides [also] taught about the smallest particles.</p>
<p>This was done by way of examples</p>
<p>[Within] the domain of analytical investigation.</p>
<p>Physical matter can be established through logic (hetunā);</p>
<p>It cannot be established by relying [solely] on enumeration.{33.78}</p>
<p>“In the past, I served fully realized buddhas</p>
<p>Whose number matched such enumeration.</p>
<p>I worshiped them</p>
<p>During this inconceivable eon.</p>
<p>In the infinity of time,</p>
<p>I became a bodhisattva long ago. {33.79}</p>
<p>“For the sake of beings,</p>
<p>I became fully realized and attained buddhahood.</p>
<p>I taught tantra in different places,</p>
<p>Providing full details of the rituals. {33.80}</p>
<p>“Taught by the buddhas,</p>
<p>This supreme [manual of] rites is the best.</p>
<p>It was taught to me in the past</p>
<p>By so many fully realized buddhas. {33.81}</p>
<p>“And now, O divine youth, I teach it myself</p>
<p>During my final embodied existence.</p>

<p>And auspicious kings of rites there are, {33.82}</p>
<p>“However many supramundane or divine mantras there are</p>
<p>Among men, gods, and asuras,</p>
<p>I have explained tantric applications</p>
<p>For all of them. {33.83}</p>
<p>“This king of manuals, celebrated everywhere,</p>
<p>Has great magical power.</p>
<p>By applying the ritual procedures of the mantras</p>
<p>One will attain accomplishment and become like Mañjughoṣa.{33.84}</p>
<p>“It has been declared by Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>The powerful lord, that by the sole means of</p>
<p>This manual with its procedures</p>
<p>All these [mantras] will be accomplished.{33.85}</p>
<p>“It is a foregone conclusion that</p>
<p>Whatever other deity mantras there are—</p>
<p>All the supramundane</p>
<p>And mundane ones of great power— {33.86}</p>
<p>“They too can become accomplished</p>
<p>By the ritual methods in this king of manuals.</p>

<p>In this supreme king of manuals.{33.87}</p>

<p>In order to benefit sentient beings. {33.92}</p>
<p>“In former times, I, the bodhisattva,</p>
<p>Knowing that they benefit beings,</p>
<p>Taught them to the inhabitants</p>
<p>Of the ocean of saṃsāra. {33.93}</p>
<p>“Living for a long time</p>
<p>In the dense forests of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>I act in the way that</p>
<p>Brings beings to maturity. {33.94}</p>
<p>“I work for the benefit of beings,</p>
<p>Creating for them stores of merit</p>
<p>In every way that good karma</p>
<p>Can be accumulated. {33.95}</p>
<p>“Established in various activities,</p>
<p>Beings obtain [corresponding] types of birth.</p>

<p>For those limited by birth who have various needs.{33.96}</p>
<p>“Beings engage in various activities,</p>
<p>Serving the different aims described in the śāstras.</p>
<p>I fulfill these [aims] for them,</p>
<p>Assuming various excellent forms. {33.97}</p>
<p>“I thus assume different guises,</p>
<p>Using different bodies, be they my own or not.</p>
<p>Motivated by [the wish] to benefit beings,</p>
<p>I created different forms. {33.98}</p>
<p>“I created, in the past, [the forms of]</p>
<p>Maheśvara, Śakra, Brahmā, and others;</p>
<p>Viṣṇu, Dhanada, and Nairṛta;</p>
<p>And also the different forms of the grahas. {33.99}</p>
<p>“With their minds full of great compassion,</p>
<p>They are objects of refuge for beings.</p>
<p>Gradually, I establish these beings</p>
<p>In a state of peace. {33.100}</p>
<p>“I wander throughout saṃsāra,</p>
<p>Observing beings over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Being of the nature of the mantra,</p>
<p>I bring the fulfillment of their needs.{33.101}</p>
<p>“While wandering from birth to birth,</p>
<p>I propagate, relying in the lineage of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Mantric rituals that represent</p>
<p>The gradual knowledge of the mantras. {33.102}</p>
<p>“For me, there is neither a creator,</p>
<p>Nor an owner.</p>
<p>Always relying on the lineage,</p>
<p>I have realized the ultimate awakening. {33.103}</p>
<p>“I am at ease, un-aging, peaceful,</p>
<p>Free from worry, pure, and benevolent.</p>

<p>And liberation from the fetters of birth. {33.104}</p>
<p>“Presently, the wheel that holds fast to the ultimate reality</p>
<p>Is made to roll on,</p>

<p>That explains mantras at length.</p>

<p>This manual of rites in any of its details. {33.105}</p>
<p>“Whatever worldly mantras there are,</p>
<p>Their rituals have been taught accordingly.</p>
<p>All these [mantras] should be worshiped and honored,</p>
<p>Without any contempt whatsoever.</p>
<p>Consequently, the practitioner of mantra</p>
<p>Must also not disregard their [respective] rituals in any detail. {33.106}</p>
<p>“As for applying the knowledge of signs</p>
<p>That has been taught as the science of astrology,</p>
<p>One should not interpret these [signs] incorrectly.</p>
<p>They have been taught for good purposes, {33.107}</p>
<p>“So that mundane pursuits, such as</p>
<p>The preparation of power substances and other medicines,</p>
<p>Or the healing [remedies] for the eyes, can succeed—</p>
<p>They are thus described as beneficial. {33.108}</p>
<p>“The sayings of the victorious ones, adorned with the stanzas of benediction,</p>
<p>Recommend the auspicious [settings].</p>
<p>One should choose a day during a bright fortnight</p>
<p>Recommended as the best and indicated by auspicious signs. {33.109}</p>
<p>“With such auspicious and excellent planetary positions,</p>
<p>One should commence the mantra practice.</p>
<p>One should thus choose the auspicious [signs]</p>
<p>And avoid the inauspicious. {33.110}</p>
<p>“I myself taught these things in the past;</p>
<p>The mantra reciters should therefore accept them [as true].</p>
<p>Whatever benefits there are in this world</p>
<p>That can be derived from the knowledge of astrology, {33.111}</p>
<p>“Or other such benefits—</p>
<p>Those derived from polity and logic</p>
<p>Or those well conceived in the treatises of Nyāya</p>
<p>For the benefit of beings— {33.112}</p>
<p>“I have taught all of this</p>
<p>And the mantra reciters should accept it [as true].</p>
<p>This path is the cause of accomplishment;</p>
<p>It has been shown by those who know reality. {33.113}</p>
<p>“The entire [Buddhist] canon, as taught by me,</p>
<p>Is wholly for bringing liberation.</p>
<p>Because of this, one should follow the path of mantras,</p>
<p>As they are the source of accomplishment. {33.114}</p>
<p>“The reciter must never, to any extent,</p>
<p>Employ the mantras the wrong way,</p>
<p>Be they any of the worldly mantras</p>
<p>Or those proclaimed as supreme. {33.115}</p>
<p>“When employing, in any [rites],</p>
<p>The supramundane mantras or the divine mantras [of magic],</p>
<p>One must not harbor wrong thoughts</p>
<p>And must never defile one’s mind. {33.116}</p>
<p>“One should worship all the mantra [deities]</p>
<p>Approved for those who know the right time</p>
<p>And taught in the instructions of the Teacher</p>
<p>That are founded on the sameness of all buddhas.{33.117}</p>
<p>“These deities are the recourse of the victors’ sons;</p>
<p>They are summoned and caused to enter</p>
<p>Into the maṇḍala of the moon-like sages.</p>
<p>They are here taught for those who know the right time.{33.118}</p>
<p>“They are always effectual, and if one wishes them to enter,</p>
<p>One can summon them with mantras.</p>
<p>One should neither bow to submit to the mantras [deities]</p>
<p>Of other systems, nor treat them with contempt,</p>
<p>As it is said that the mantras that are debased</p>
<p>Are not unproductive. {33.119}</p>
<p>“Whatever worldly mantras there are,</p>
<p>Reciting them brings inferior results.</p>
<p>Although they produce results for reciters,</p>
<p>They will lead, as far as can be seen, to afflictions. {33.120}</p>
<p>“When one feels indignant and angry,</p>
<p>One should not harbor wrong thoughts.</p>
<p>Nor should one indulge in pleasures,</p>
<p>As this brings adverse karmic results.</p>
<p>One must not allow one’s mind</p>
<p>To develop such inclinations. {33.121}</p>
<p>“One should stick with just one mantra</p>
<p>And recite it continuously with a focused mind.</p>
<p>One will consequently obtain the full result</p>
<p>As specified in the ritual instructions. {33.122}</p>
<p>“Without allowing the mind to wander,</p>
<p>One should recite the same mantra.</p>
<p>Mantras accomplished through single-mindedness</p>
<p>Will accomplish every purpose. {33.123}</p>
<p>“One who is distracted in mind and inwardly confused</p>
<p>Will not see success.</p>
<p>One should instead win the full array of results</p>
<p>And a high rebirth. {33.124}</p>
<p>“One whose mind is always pure,</p>
<p>Who trusts in the teachings</p>
<p>And has faith in the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>Will obtain the accomplishment as specified.” {33.125}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter that explains the knowledge of signs pertaining to the ritual activity procedures, thirty-third in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 34</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to the divine youth Mañjuśrī as follows: {34.1}</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, to your most esoteric and secret teaching on your mudrās and mantras. No followers of your mantra path should ever disclose this teaching to people who have no trust and no faith in the doctrine of the Tathāgata; to people who do not have the authorizing samaya or do not maintain the continuity of the lineage of the Three Jewels; to people who are in bad company; to people who do not desire religious merit; to people who interact and mix with evil companions or are surrounded by bad friends; to people who distance themselves from the Buddha’s teaching; to people who have not been instructed by their master and so this manual would bring no results for them; to people, divine youth, who have not been initiated into your supreme and most secret maṇḍala; or to people who do not observe their samaya or who have no connection to the family of the Tathāgata. {34.2}</p>
<p>“One without faith in the Buddha’s teachings</p>
<p>Is far from realization.</p>
<p>One should not teach mudrās</p>
<p>Nor explain the tantra to such a person. {34.3}</p>
<p>“If someone stupefied by ignorance</p>
<p>Should disclose them through carelessness, greed, and the like,</p>
<p>The methods and mantras of such an errant reciter</p>
<p>Will not be accomplished. {34.4}</p>
<p>“One should practice the mudrās</p>
<p>And the mantras in seclusion,</p>
<p>Otherwise accomplishment will not come soon,</p>
<p>And one’s body will decline. {34.5}</p>
<p>“One can explain the art (tantra) of mudrās</p>
<p>[Only] to those who are gentle, have faith,</p>
<p>Are true to their samaya,</p>
<p>And are advanced in the tantra and mantra. {34.6}</p>
<p>“One can explain it to those who</p>
<p>Worship the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>Have faith in the doctrine of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>And know how to apply the procedure. {34.7}</p>
<p>“One can explain it to those</p>
<p>Who are adorned with bodhicitta</p>
<p>And, familiar with the methods of its generation,</p>
<p>Always pursue the path to awakening. {34.8}</p>
<p>“One can explain the mudrās to those who engage</p>
<p>In the practice of the mantras and tantras,</p>
<p>Who observe their samaya in regard to the relative and the absolute</p>
<p>And are committed to the great realization. {34.9}</p>
<p>“One can explain the mudrās to those who have faith</p>
<p>In the sons of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>In the śrāvakas and the solitary pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>And who understand the results of Dharma practice. {34.10}</p>
<p>“One can explain the mudrās to those</p>
<p>Who see phenomena without conceptual contrivance,</p>
<p>Who have faith, are free from avarice,</p>
<p>And know how to apply the Teacher’s instructions. {34.11}</p>
<p>“These mudrā seals are themselves sealed.</p>
<p>Their exact number is one hundred and eight—</p>
<p>No fewer and no more than that</p>
<p>Have been proclaimed by the buddhas. {34.12}</p>
<p>“[The number of] mantras</p>
<p>In Mañjuśrī’s manual is the same.</p>
<p>One hundred and eight mantras</p>
<p>Have been taught,</p>
<p>As have one hundred and eight mudrās</p>
<p>By the eminent sages in the past. {34.13}</p>
<p>“This number is the standard</p>
<p>For the mudrās and mantras found in this manual.</p>
<p>It is a treasury of all the buddhas</p>
<p>Referred to as a mantra treasury.</p>
<p>Mudrās used in combination with mantras</p>
<p>Accomplish activities swiftly. {34.14}</p>
<p>“Just as a chariot would never roll on</p>
<p>Without wheels,</p>
<p>So also no mantra</p>
<p>Will accomplish its activity without a mudrā.</p>
<p>Mantras used in combination with mudrās</p>
<p>Accomplish activities swiftly. {34.15}</p>
<p>“They can summon everyone within</p>
<p>The entire triple universe with its gods and asuras,</p>
<p>Let alone accomplish other activities</p>
<p>In the cultivated world of humans. {34.16}</p>
<p>“When mudrās and mantras</p>
<p>Are used together and are pure,</p>
<p>The results will be seen in real life.</p>
<p>They will manifest based on the applied procedure. {34.17}</p>
<p>“They can summon spirits,</p>
<p>As well as the eminent victors along and their sons.</p>
<p>There are three accessories that make rites effective:</p>
<p>Mantras, mudrās, and austere meditation. {34.18}</p>
<p>“The reciter can obtain</p>
<p>Any accomplishments as desired</p>
<p>If the mantras are sealed with the mudrās,</p>
<p>And the mudrās with the mantras. {34.19}</p>
<p>“If no mantra is without a mudrā</p>
<p>And no mudrā without a mantra,</p>
<p>The mudrās thus employed along with the mantras</p>
<p>Will accomplish every activity. {34.20}</p>
<p>“Mutually they produce results,</p>
<p>Which arise in mutual dependence.</p>
<p>If the practitioner applies them in tandem,</p>
<p>There is no activity that could not be accomplished. {34.21}</p>
<p>“All mantras will succeed if used along with mudrās</p>
<p>By those endowed with a physical form.</p>
<p>The mantra should be employed according to procedure</p>
<p>And sealed with a mudrā.{34.22}</p>
<p>“Even if one were to cross all the worlds</p>
<p>From the pinnacle of existence down to Avīci Hell,</p>
<p>There is no such place from where a being</p>
<p>Could not be successfully summoned, {34.23}</p>
<p>“Nor a place where a being could not be controlled</p>
<p>Even though they had not been summoned.</p>
<p>Nor is there any being</p>
<p>Able to resist [this ritual]. {34.24}</p>
<p>“Even bodhisattvas of great power can be summoned</p>
<p>And induced to speak if the procedure is followed.</p>
<p>They are unable to invalidate the protection procedure</p>
<p>Or thwart the successful outcome of a rite,</p>
<p>Even if they are established</p>
<p>On the tenth level. {34.25}</p>
<p>“Beings who rely on mantras and mudrās</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>When employed as part of the procedure</p>
<p>Mudrās become a source of protection.{34.26}</p>
<p>“They accompany all the mantras</p>
<p>And can be seen [used] with each of them.</p>
<p>So, too, each mudrā is accompanied by a mantra—</p>
<p>They belong one with the other. {34.27}</p>
<p>“If the procedures involving form and recitation</p>
<p>Are employed in the rites of homa,</p>
<p>They will be a source of accomplishment;</p>
<p>The mudrās are assigned to the mantras. {34.28}</p>
<p>“For someone who is constantly engaged in</p>
<p>And always relies on the recitation of mantras,</p>
<p>All the mantras will be effective.</p>
<p>The words of the sages are not spoken in vain— {34.29}</p>
<p>“Those who distort</p>
<p>The teachings of all the buddhas</p>
<p>Will never be able to apply</p>
<p>The art of mantras correctly.</p>
<p>Those who apply the teachings [correctly]</p>
<p>Follow the procedure complete with the mantra and the mudrā.{34.30}</p>
<p>“I say this, Mañjuśrī, divine youth,</p>
<p>Again and again, that</p>
<p>A mudrā, when complemented by a mantra,</p>
<p>Is a source of benefit. {34.31}</p>
<p>“I applaud the result derived from this king of manuals,</p>
<p>Which is to ferry [beings] out of [saṃsāra].</p>
<p>The art of mudrās constitutes</p>
<p>The most secret boon for the world.”{34.32}</p>
<p>Then, smiling softly,</p>
<p>The divine youth who is the origin of everything,</p>
<p>Clever, glorious, and forbearing,</p>
<p>With the form of a young boy,</p>
<p>The bodhisattva of great courage</p>
<p>Established on the tenth level, said, {34.33}</p>
<p>“Please explain, O supreme of sages,</p>
<p>The buddha Friend of the Sun,</p>
<p>[Why it is] that you, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>For the sake of mantras, teach in this world {34.34}</p>
<p>“That which has already been taught to me</p>
<p>By the fully realized buddhas in the past.</p>
<p>Why is the Lion of the Śākyas</p>
<p>Teaching it [again] now?</p>
<p>This uncertainty is born [in me],</p>
<p>So please explain [this], O supreme sage!” {34.35}</p>
<p>The learned one with the sweet voice of a cuckoo</p>
<p>That resembles the powerful voice of Brahmā</p>
<p>Replied to the bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī],</p>
<p>Who was established on the tenth level, {34.36}</p>
<p>“Formerly, while wandering</p>
<p>In saṃsāra over many eons,</p>
<p>I obtained this king of manuals</p>
<p>From the sage called Saṃkusuma.{34.37}</p>
<p>“[Wandering] from place to place,</p>
<p>I brought about much help for beings.</p>
<p>Swayed by the power of compassion,</p>
<p>I formed an aspiration then</p>
<p>That I would become, during the debased eon,</p>
<p>The supreme buddha. {34.38}</p>
<p>“Having fulfilled the goal of teaching</p>
<p>And having set the Dharma wheel rolling,</p>
<p>In the final period</p>
<p>Before I would pass into nirvāṇa on earth,</p>
<p>I would teach this king of manuals</p>
<p>In your presence. {34.39}</p>
<p>“When I have departed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And the world that is called Jambu is empty,</p>
<p>When the Dharma basket of the Teacher</p>
<p>Is difficult to find, during the lowest eon,</p>
<p>This king of manuals would fulfill</p>
<p>The purpose of instructing beings. {34.40}</p>
<p>“This king of manuals, with its extensive contents,</p>
<p>Is [now] entrusted to you in particular,</p>
<p>So that it will be used, at that time,</p>
<p>For the benefit of beings. {34.41}</p>
<p>“At that terrible time,</p>
<p>People will be without Dharma.</p>
<p>Never following any rules,</p>
<p>The kings will be full of ill will. {34.42}</p>
<p>“Both humans and nonhuman beings</p>
<p>Will all be hostile to the teaching.</p>
<p>They will destroy the entire Dharma basket</p>
<p>That I have taught. {34.43}</p>
<p>“The mantra basket was taught</p>
<p>In order to guide them.</p>
<p>It was for you, O divine youth, that I made this aspiration</p>
<p>Throughout inconceivable past eons:{34.44}</p>
<p>“ ‘Whatever buddhas, friends of the world, have existed,</p>
<p>Who are now in the state of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>I will strive to spread their doctrine</p>
<p>Eon after eon. {34.45}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will travel everywhere</p>
<p>In the form of a young boy</p>
<p>And guide beings</p>
<p>In the form of the mantra, time after time.’ {34.46}</p>
<p>“This aspiration, O divine youth,</p>
<p>I made in the past for you.</p>
<p>This has now come to pass, O youth!</p>
<p>This is my instruction to you:{34.47}</p>
<p>“When the buddhafield is empty</p>
<p>And people are without refuge,</p>
<p>You should instruct them, as a young boy,</p>
<p>In the form of the mantra. {34.48}</p>
<p>“You will guide many beings,</p>
<p>Granting them every good fortune.</p>
<p>At that time, during the debased eon,</p>
<p>You will grant boons to all beings. {34.49}</p>
<p>“When I have departed from this world into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And the land has become empty,</p>
<p>You will carry on the Buddha’s work</p>
<p>In the form of a young boy. {34.50}</p>
<p>“At that time, I will enter nirvāṇa</p>
<p>In the delightful wilderness</p>
<p>Of the foothills of the Himalayas,</p>
<p>On the bank of the Hiraṇyavatī.” {34.51}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter with the instructions on the procedures enhanced by the stimulus of mudrās, given in response to Mañjuśrī’s inquiry, thirty-fourth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 35</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode  and entered the samādhi called that which animates the great receptacle of mudrās of the tathāgatas. As soon as he entered this samādhi, a great light issued from the tuft of hair between his eyebrows. This mass of light, surrounded by innumerable billions of light rays, illuminated many buddhafields, arousing all the buddhas [dwelling there], and entered back into Lord Śākyamuni’s tuft of hair. {35.1}</p>
<p>As soon as they were roused, all the blessed buddhas entered the samādhi of the nature of the sky and positioned themselves in the sky above the Pure Abode. Having greeted all of them reverentially, the blessed Śākyamuni spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, about the procedures pertaining to the receptacle of mudrās, blessed by all the buddhas to come.” {35.2}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, prostrated to the feet of the Blessed One, bowed to all the buddhas, and spoke to blessed Tathāgata Śākyamuni as follows: {35.3}</p>
<p>“Very good, O Blessed One! Please teach, if you think that the time is right, the most secret chapter on the receptacle of the mudrās of all the tathāgatas. This will be for the benefit and happiness of many people. Teach it out of kindness for the world, for the welfare and happiness of great numbers of people. This will create happiness and the ripening [of the causes of] happiness for gods, men, and all beings.” {35.4}</p>
<p>Being thus supplicated by Blessed Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, the blessed Śākyamuni began to teach, gazing at all the buddhas, directing his attention to all the beings, gladdening all the bodhisattvas, perfectly calming  all the pratyeka­buddhas and noble śrāvakas, animating all those whose minds were occupied with the meaning of their respective mantras, keeping all the evil beings at bay, restoring confidence in all the frightened ones, and establishing in the ease of the auspicious nirvāṇa all those that were in difficult predicaments. For the happiness of all suffering beings, he taught the procedures from the chapter on the mudrās as follows: {35.5}</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, divine youth,</p>
<p>As I teach the chapter on mudrās.</p>
<p>First comes the five-crested</p>
<p>Known as a ‘great mudrā.’{35.6}</p>

<p>“With the hands, which are clean, unimpaired,</p>
<p>Perfect, and free of blisters—only with such hands—</p>
<p>One should form a mudrā for saluting, and so forth,</p>

<p>“One should salute any buddha from among the above</p>
<p>Who are superior among two-legged beings.</p>
<p>Purified, in a clean place,</p>
<p>One should form a mudrā during recitation. {35.124}</p>
<p>“Once having examined the master,</p>
<p>One should relinquish one’s doubts about him.</p>
<p>Adhering to the right conduct,</p>
<p>One should form a mudrā at ease. {35.125}</p>
<p>“One should clean a [suitable] place, set it up as separate,</p>
<p>And incant it with the mantra.</p>
<p>One must not get angry, leave rubbish behind,</p>
<p>Or be an object of the others’ rebukes.{35.126}</p>
<p>“One should never form a mudrā</p>
<p>Near smoldering embers or ashes.</p>
<p>Nor should one hanker after the wives</p>
<p>Or the possessions of others. {35.127}</p>
<p>“For a mudrā to bring happiness, one should form it</p>
<p>Neither standing up nor lying down.</p>
<p>One should not be facing south</p>
<p>Or west. {35.128}</p>
<p>“Nor should one form a mudrā</p>

<p>This procedure is regarded as supreme. {35.130}</p>
<p>“Next, I will teach the mudrās</p>

<p>Pointing them toward the tips</p>
<p>Of the middle fingers.{35.131}</p>
<p>“The tips of the index and small fingers</p>

<p>“The two fingers should touch</p>
<p>At the third knuckle below the nail [of the middle finger].</p>
<p>One should thus display the shape of a needle,</p>
<p>While forming a sheath [with one’s hands].</p>
<p>This is the mudrā of the mantra-lord,</p>
<p>The great Cakravartin.{35.273}</p>
<p>“If the same index fingers are brought into contact</p>
<p>With the middle finger sidelong,</p>
<p>And the ring fingers touch</p>
<p>At the tips of the fingernails,</p>
<p>That mudrā is the uṣṇīṣa;</p>
<p>It was taught by the victorious lords. {35.274}</p>
<p>“One should place the hands as before,</p>
<p>With the middle fingers entwined</p>
<p>And the small fingers joined together;</p>
<p>This mudrā is called the arising of Sitātapatra. {35.275}</p>
<p>“One should align the tips of the middle fingers</p>
<p>So that their fingernails touch.</p>
<p>When the shape of a bracelet is formed,</p>
<p>The mudrā is said to be the great mudrā.{35.276}</p>
<p>“One should place the tips of the index fingers</p>
<p>. . . with the three . . .</p>
<p>The middle fingers should form a ‘needle,’</p>
<p>With the hands firmly joined below.{35.277}</p>
<p>“The thumbs should reach [to the middle fingers],</p>
<p>With their nails squeezed [under the third joint thereof].</p>
<p>This mudrā is taught as the most excellent mudrā</p>
<p>Of the sagacious Mañjughoṣa.{35.278}</p>
<p>“One should place the hands as before,</p>
<p>Forming the añjali gesture.</p>
<p>The tips of the middle fingers</p>
<p>Should remain bent.</p>
<p>The thumbs should touch the joints</p>
<p>Of the middle and three other fingers.{35.279}</p>
<p>“One should then form a ‘needle’ with the small fingers,</p>
<p>Straightening them and raising them up.</p>
<p>This excellent supreme mudrā</p>
<p>Constitutes the treasury of the Dharma.{35.280}</p>
<p>“One should position the hands as before</p>
<p>Following the same basic instructions,</p>
<p>And then arrange all the fingers</p>
<p>To form the complete [shape of] a basket. {35.281}</p>
<p>“Both hands should be splayed,</p>
<p>With the eight fingers forming an enclosure.</p>
<p>These eight, divided into four pairs,</p>
<p>Represent the eight personages who know reality.</p>
<p>The perfect buddhas, supreme among two-legged beings,</p>
<p>Call this mudrā the saṅgha. {35.282}</p>
<p>“This mudrā is known</p>
<p>In the realm of existence as the saṅgha.</p>
<p>It is supreme and excellent,</p>
<p>As it accomplishes the aims of all activities.{35.283}</p>
<p>“One should cup the hands,</p>
<p>Joining them together in an añjali gesture,</p>
<p>And then extend the index finger</p>
<p>Of the right hand. {35.284}</p>
<p>“This mudrā, the pacifier of beings,</p>
<p>Was taught by the teachers who see reality;</p>
<p>It is described as excellent,</p>
<p>As it fulfills the aims of all activities. {35.285}</p>
<p>“One should place the hands as before,</p>
<p>Their fingertips ‘piled up’ in a line.</p>
<p>The hands should form a lump, hollow within,</p>
<p>With the thumbs raised up and bent.</p>
<p>This mudrā, the lotus wreath,</p>
<p>Was taught by the buddhas from the earliest times. {35.286}</p>
<p>“The palms of the hands should face upward,</p>
<p>With the fingers splayed around.</p>
<p>The hands should form the shape of a fully open bud,</p>
<p>With the thumbs and three other fingers fully extended.{35.287}</p>
<p>“The thumbs and the index fingers</p>
<p>Should touch at the second joint.</p>
<p>The fully realized buddhas call this excellent mudrā</p>
<p>The abode of the Thirty[-Three].{35.288}</p>
<p>“These [last] eight mudrās, designated as</p>
<p>‘Great’ mudrās, are suitable for peaceful rites.</p>
<p>Taught by the fully realized buddhas,</p>
<p>They are of equal splendor and great efficacy. {35.289}</p>
<p>“The spontaneously arisen</p>
<p>Eminent sages of the past,</p>
<p>Who are beyond counting,</p>
<p>Taught sixty quadrillions and eighty mudrās.</p>
<p>The practical instructions</p>
<p>Were given for 108 mudrās. {35.290}</p>
<p>“With all of them available,</p>
<p>One can accomplish all the mantra-rites;</p>
<p>One will accomplish the rites</p>
<p>Of all the mantra [deities].{35.291}</p>
<p>“These one hundred [and eight] mudrās were taught</p>
<p>By all the buddhas of great power.</p>
<p>If employed according to procedure,</p>
<p>They will swiftly accomplish all aims.” {35.292}</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, the most eminent of sages,</p>
<p>The Lion of the Śākyas, supreme among men,</p>
<p>Then specifically addressed Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>The bodhisattva of great power: {35.293}</p>
<p>“This collection of the different sets of mudrās</p>
<p>Found in your manual</p>
<p>Was handed down by yourself, Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>To protect [the Buddha’s] instructions on earth</p>
<p>At the time when the final period has arrived</p>
<p>And I have departed into nirvāṇa. {35.294}</p>
<p>“I have now taught all of it</p>
<p>In order to protect my doctrine—</p>
<p>I taught the defining characteristics</p>
<p>Of the mudrās and the mantras at length.</p>
<p>This esoteric and secret lore</p>
<p>Has now been taught for all of the world. {35.295}</p>
<p>“It has been taught in this sūtra—the lord of manuals</p>
<p>That is replete with excellent qualities</p>
<p>That arise in multiple ways</p>
<p>Based on the letters of the mantras. {35.296}</p>
<p>“Many applications of mantra and tantra</p>
<p>Have been explained in it.</p>
<p>[This sūtra] constitutes for the reciters the cause</p>
<p>Of a definitive accomplishment of glorious qualities. {35.297}</p>
<p>“It is said that auspicious results will arise</p>
<p>For beings, whatever destinies they follow,</p>
<p>If they apply themselves to the cause</p>
<p>Of accomplishing your mantras, O divine youth!” {35.298}</p>
<p>Thus addressed, the divine youth Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Resting in space,</p>
<p>Bowed his head to the perfect Buddha,</p>
<p>The sun-like lord of the world. {35.299}</p>
<p>He sighed deeply, tender with compassion,</p>
<p>And then began to weep piteously.</p>
<p>He moved close to the Buddha</p>
<p>And asked about the supreme boon:{35.300}</p>
<p>“When the mantra basket [of teachings]</p>
<p>Has disappeared in the world and on earth,</p>
<p>How will beings be able to ensure</p>
<p>An auspicious course of rebirth?”{35.301}</p>
<p>Being thus asked, the perfect buddha</p>
<p>Spoke to Mañjughoṣa as follows:</p>
<p>“Listen, dear Mañjuśrī, divine youth,</p>
<p>If you are asking.</p>
<p>When I have passed from this world into final nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And the earth is devoid of a buddha,</p>
<p>When the basket of the Dharma has disappeared</p>
<p>And [all] the śrāvakas have long ago entered nirvāṇa, {35.302}</p>
<p>“At that time, [beings] should make</p>
<p>An image of the Teacher, best of two-legged beings,</p>
<p>And offer to it, respectfully,</p>
<p>Incense, fragrances, scented oils, {35.303}</p>
<p>“Different types of high-quality clothes,</p>
<p>And other things, such as jeweled earrings, adornments,</p>
<p>And sacrificial food consisting of</p>
<p>Different types of solid and liquid articles</p>
<p>That come in different forms,</p>
<p>According to the maker’s choice. {35.304}</p>
<p>“The destiny of beings who repeat the mantra</p>
<p>While doing these things will be auspicious.</p>
<p>They will reach exalted abodes</p>
<p>And the highest birth.</p>
<p>They will eventually attain awakening</p>
<p>And obtain the subsequent peace.” {35.305}</p>
<p>Buoyed up by the perfect Buddha,</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī rejoiced at his words.</p>
<p>The sagacious bodhisattva of great power</p>
<p>Remained very joyful afterward.{35.306}</p>
<p>All that was taught in former times</p>
<p>Was now set to continue above the realm of the Pure Abode.</p>
<p>The Buddha, turner of the wheel of Dharma,</p>
<p>Turned, in the presence of the buddhas,</p>
<p>The wheel of the mantra [path],</p>
<p>Letting it roll for a long time.{35.307}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on mudrā procedures, thirty-fifth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 36</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, a most secret mudrā presentation that includes your root mudrā and its assorted mudrās. [These mudrās] may be employed in all rites. In short, they bring every kind of good fortune and produce results; they supplement every mantra and accomplish the aim of every activity. {36.1}</p>
<p>“To start, one should extend the hands in the añjali gesture, with the index and the ring fingers folded in at the middle joint and the fingers not touching. This, Mañjuśrī, is described as your root mudrā; it is suitable for all rites. {36.2}</p>
<p>“If one joins the hands the same way, but with the ring, index, and middle fingers touching closely and the small fingers positioned along an upward line toward the tips of the thumbs, this, Mañjuśrī, is another mudrā of yours, called the mouth. {36.3}</p>
<p>“If one makes a fist in such a way that the facing fingers touch, extends the middle fingers to form the shape of a needle, and places the two index fingers in such a way that they surround this [needle] on either side, this, Mañjuśrī, is your mudrā called the fangs. {36.4}</p>
<p>“If one [subsequently] positions the thumbs on either side, that mudrā is you, Mañjuśrī, in person. You remain contained in that place, in the cavity between the hands, as the blessing of the samaya. {36.5}</p>
<p>“If one stretches out the index fingers of the mutually touching fists and positions both thumbs in the space in between, this, Mañjuśrī, is another one of your mudrās, [called] the crest. {36.6}</p>
<p>“If one extends the hands in the añjali gesture and places the index finger, crossed at the joints with the ring finger, between the tips of the middle fingers, this, Mañjuśrī, is another root mudrā that is said to be yourself in person.{36.7}</p>
<p>“If one forms the same mudrā as before, but with the index fingers extended, this, Mañjuśrī, is your eye mudrā. {36.8}</p>
<p>“If the small and ring fingers are entwined and positioned in the cavity between the hands, the middle fingers are placed on the outside with their tips folded in above the index fingers, and the tips of the thumbs press against each other, this, Mañjuśrī, is yet another mouth mudrā of yours. {36.9}</p>
<p>“Proceeding in the same way, one should loosen up the fingers one by one—all of them, including the thumbs—and then extend them one by one, with the right thumb raised up. This, Mañjuśrī, is your uṣṇīṣa mudrā. {36.10}</p>
<p>“When the right . . . is curled and the left extended, that [same mudrā] becomes the forehead mudrā; seeing it, all the wicked grahas will flee. {36.11}</p>
<p>“In the same way [one should form the mudrās of] the ears, neck, arms, heart, hands, throat, hips, navel, thighs, calves, feet, eyes, mouth, and tongue. By extending the ten fingers one after the other, one will display the mudrā signs in their respective order. They accomplish their respective activities: {36.12}</p>
<p>“A mouth mudrā will shut [the opponent’s] mouth. The fangs mudrā will effect release from the wicked grahas. The tongue mudrā will suppress evil talk. The heart mudrā will appease the king’s anger, or the anger of any other displeased being—  a god or asura, or any other human or nonhuman being born in whatever form. In this way, one can successively accomplish all activities in all respects. {36.13}</p>
<p>“Following this pattern, there are innumerable mudrās. Accordingly, Mañjuśrī, you can accomplish every activity whatsoever. All activities arise because of all these mudrās. These great mudrās are used by tathāgatas impossible to count, great heroes and protectors, and also by the great heroes who have reached all the higher levels that transcend the world—ever and ever beyond it—where myriads [of them abide]. They are the thirty-six . . . eighty . . . nine . . . five . . . who are sixty billion in number.{36.14}</p>
<p>“All the rites involve mudrās,</p>
<p>Including all the worldly rites.</p>
<p>If performed using these and other mudrās,</p>
<p>These rites can accomplish the aim of any practice. {36.15}</p>
<p>“The mudrās are formed with both hands</p>
<p>At the time of practice within the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Whether one is doing the preliminary practice,</p>
<p>The homa [rite], or during recitation. {36.16}</p>
<p>“A vow holder may recite while sitting,</p>
<p>Standing, or however they wish.</p>
<p>One should perform all the activities</p>
<p>Always relying on the full repertoire of the mudrās</p>
<p>And employing the ritual procedure</p>
<p>Of the great protection for oneself and others.” {36.17}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed second chapter on mudrā procedures, thirty-sixth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 37</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, as follows: {37.1}</p>
<p>“There is, Mañjuśrī, in your root manual, another most secret mudrā. Its ritual procedure [represents] the entire mudrā system.  It is recommended for all the mantras and can be employed with any of them. It accomplishes all rites and purifies the path to perfect awakening. It destroys all the paths that lead to saṃsāric existence. It sustains all beings and grants long life, freedom from disease, and powerful sense faculties. It fulfills all wishes and gives rise to all the factors of awakening. It gives joy to all beings and produces the results they all wish and hope for. It fulfills all activities and makes all mantras efficacious. It comprises all the other mudrās and mantras. Listen, Mañjuśrī, divine youth! {37.2}</p>
<p>“One starts with the [hand] sign of uṣṇīṣa. Both hands should be extended and evenly aligned, forming the shape of a flame. The ring fingers should be between the hands, their nails placed one against the other and covered by the tips of the thumbs. The small fingers should form a ‘needle’ with their tips joined, and the middle fingers should be centered, aligned, and touching at the nails. The index fingers should form a ‘needle.’ This is the great mudrā called the great representation of the uṣṇīṣa surrounded by light. The corresponding mantra is āḥ maḥ haṁ. {37.3}</p>
<p>“If, subsequently, one brings the index fingers together so that one fingernail touches the other and the fingertips form the shape of a circle, this is the great Dharma-wheel mudrā called incineratingthe perversions—the thorns of the wrong views. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, make [them] tremble and fall! Crush [them], O wheel! You are the possessor of the vajra, hūṁ!{37.4}</p>
<p>“If, subsequently, one . . . the index fingers . . . , this is the great mudrā called the seat of the enemies of the four māras—the vajra heroine who devours the great afflictions [experienced] on the earth with its animate and inanimate entities. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Vajrānanī!Hūṁ phaṭ!{37.5}</p>
<p>“These mudrās and mantras</p>
<p>Can be universally employed in all rites.</p>
<p>They will destroy all the vighnas</p>
<p>Like autumn clouds. {37.6}</p>
<p>“Any obstacles created by the four māras</p>
<p>And those created by gods or asuras</p>
<p>Will all perish as soon as</p>
<p>This supreme mudrā is displayed.{37.7}</p>
<p>“Further, the third [of these] mudrās may be formed by displaying</p>
<p>The same gesture, but with the index fingers loosened up.</p>
<p>If the [remaining] fingertips are neatly folded in,</p>
<p>Such a fist is known as the tathāgatī.</p>
<p>“This great mudrā is known throughout the three worlds under the name of the garland of light rays of the great lord. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“OṁVijayā! Haḥ!{37.8}</p>
<p>“There is also the fist mudrā of the tathāgata, [where] the two hands are evenly aligned below. During formal or preliminary practice, one should recite the mantra just once while forming any of these mudrās with both hands, and then recite as long as one likes, either sitting or standing. Consequently, no vighnas or vināyakas will be able to cause harm, and the accomplishment will be imminent. {37.9}</p>
<p>“If one brings the same index fingers together in such a way that their tips touch above the middle fingers, this is the mudrā of Udgatoṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is</p>
<p>Oṁ, burn, blaze up! O blazing Udgatoṣṇīṣa! Make [them] tremble, do! Hūṁ!{37.10}</p>
<p>“If one brings the same index fingers into contact with the ‘needle’ formed by the middle fingers and joins them at the tips of the fingernails so that they form the shape of a straightened anklet, this is the mudrā of the uṣṇīṣa [king] Sitātapatra. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, ma ma ma ma, hūṁ niḥ!{37.11}</p>
<p>“If, subsequently, the same index fingers are evenly raised so that they cling to the ‘needle’ formed by the middle fingers, this is the mudrā of Tejorāśi. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Tejorāśi! You are the uṣṇīṣa of the tathāgatas, invisible on their head! Blaze, blaze! You are one and unique! Rip and tear! Chop and split! Hūṁ hūṁ, sphaṭ sphaṭ, svāhā!{37.12}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are joined, forming the shape of the circle, while the middle fingers form the ‘needle,’ this is the mudrā of Jayoṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Jayoṣṇīṣa! Blaze, blaze! Bind, bind! Tame, tame! Ṅraṁ ṅraṁ ṅraṁ, haḥ! Strike! Hūṁ! This is the mantra of Jayoṣṇīṣa.{37.13}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are brought in contact with the ‘needle’ of the middle fingers above the nail and cling to them at the third phalanx, this is the mudrā of [the uṣṇīṣa king] Cakravartin. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, homage to Cakravartin, the invincible uṣṇīṣa of the tathāgatas, invisible at the top of their head, hūṁ! Blaze, blaze! Burn, burn! Make [them] tremble, make! Drive [them] away! Frighten [them]! Kill [them]! Uproot [them]! Strike, strike! Aṁ aṁ aḥ aḥ kaḥ kaḥ! O Proṅkhinī, Proṅkhinī! The unconquerable bearer of arms, adorned with earrings! Hūṁ phaṭ!</p>
<p>“[This is the mantra of] Cakravartin.{37.14}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are brought into contact with the ‘needle’ of the middle fingers under the fingernail and cling to them along the third phalanx, this is the mudrā of Cakravartin, the lord of mantras. If the index fingers are brought into contact with the ‘needle,’ touching it under the fingernail, this is the mudrā of the lord of mantras.{37.15}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are brought together  and remain in contact in the space between the fingernail phalanges of the needle-shaped middle fingers, this is the mudrā of Mahācakravartin. If the tips of the same index fingers are brought together and mutually touch below the third phalanx of the needle-shaped middle fingers, forming thus the shape of a circle, this is [another] mudrā of Mahācakravartin. If the tips of the same index fingers are brought together and mutually touch in the space between the third phalanges of the needle-shaped middle fingers, this is [another] mudrā of Mahācakravartin, the lord of mantras.{37.16}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are made into the shape of an anklet with each tip touching the third joint [of the opposite finger(?)] and are positioned below the middle joint of the needle-shaped middle fingers, this is the heart mudrā of the cakravartin Aparājitoṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Aparājita,dhik!</p>
<p>“Using the root and other mudrās of the uṣṇīṣa kings as an auxiliary practice one will accomplish all activities. {37.17}</p>
<p>“If one extends the tips of the thumbs up to the [base of] the ring fingers and raises [the hands], this is the mudrā of summoning. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Come, come, O blessed Dharma lord! Take this welcome offering of water, fragrances, flowers, incense, refreshments, and lamps, and protect me! Svāhā to you, one of invincible strength and power!</p>
<p>“When one has performed the summoning, using flowers that are naturally white, water for the feet, water for rinsing the mouth, and a seat to sit on, one should bind the cardinal directions, the intermediate directions, and the ones above and below, using the same.{37.18}</p>
<p>“One should touch, as before, the ring fingers with the tips of the thumbs and then bend the ring fingers at the middle joint. When they have touched [the thumbs?], one should stretch them upward. One should rotate [this mudrā] from the right to the left with the offering of dismissal for one’s deity. The mudrās for binding the directions should [also] be displayed. The corresponding mantra for dismissing is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the invincible uṣṇīṣa! Go, go, O blessed Dharma lord! Take from me this dismissal offering of water, fragrances, flowers, and incense, and protect me! Svāhā to you, invincibly strong and powerful!</p>
<p>“These were the mudrā and the mantra of  dismissing with the respective offerings. {37.19}</p>
<p>“The same index fingers should touch below at the third joint of the needle-shaped middle fingers. The opposite thumbs, together with the small fingers, should form a tight fist. The middle fingers should form a ‘needle.’ The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Oṁ oṁ, hrauṁ! Bind, hūṁ phaṭ!</p>
<p>“This mudrā and mantra of the invincible uṣṇīṣa Tejorāśi can be employed in all the rites of binding, and so forth. It will accomplish all of them. {37.20}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the same index fingers are folded in and lightly touch at the third joint of the needle-shaped middle fingers, this is the mudrā of Vikaraṇoṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! O Vikaraṇa, shake [them], shake! Hūṁ!</p>
<p>“The great vidyārāja Vikaraṇoṣṇīṣa can be employed in all the rites belonging to the uṣṇīṣa system of the blessed vidyārāja, such as destroying all the vighnas and vināyakas, conferring empowerments, self-protection, binding the directions, binding the maṇḍala, and so forth. {37.21}</p>
<p>“If the same index fingers are extended outward with the tips folded in and are moved in a pulling motion, [this is the mudrā] for summoning [the god of] fire for the purpose of homa. The same mudrā [is used also] for dismissing, if the index fingers are stretched forth. This is the mudrā of Jvālā­mālinoṣṇīṣa. It is invincible in every rite. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Come, come! Svāhā to Agni, one who is garlanded with flames!{37.22}</p>
<p>“If the same index fingers are folded at the tips and are joined together in the space between the needle-shaped middle fingers at the third joint, this is the mudrā of Balotkaṭoṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Accept these fragrances, flowers, incense, refreshments, and lamps! Take [them], take. Svāhā to you, invincible Dharma king!</p>
<p>“This is the mantra for offering fragrances, and so forth. {37.23}</p>
<p>“If the ring fingers are in reverse position, the thumbs joined at the third joint, and the index fingers form the shape of a needle, this is the mudrā of Vajratejoṣṇīṣa. Unassailable by any vināyakas, it should be used to restrain them and, also, for making the time and the place salutary. One can thus use this mudrā and its mantra to afford protection at the time of recitation, formal practice, or the maṇḍala [ritual]. They can be used in all activities. The mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa who destroys all the vighnas! Destroy [them]! Svāhā!{37.24}</p>
<p>“If the ring fingers [each] form a circle [touching] the base of the thumb, and the index fingers form the shape of a needle, this is the mudrā of Aparājitoṣṇīṣa,  invincible in every way. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, Aparājitoṣṇīṣa that can never be defeated! O great vidyā! You are the samaya, peaceful and restrained, taught by the Dharma king! You fulfill all aims, svāhā!</p>
<p>“One should perform, [using this mudrā and mantra], the rites of pacifying and nourishing, while offering homas of ghee, and so forth. {37.25}</p>
<p>“If the same ring fingers are folded into a circular shape, and the folded tips of the index fingers press against each other, this is the mudrā of Śaṅkaroṣṇīṣa. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed invincible uṣṇīṣa! Oṁ, svāhā to Śaṅkara!</p>
<p>“[This mantra and mudrā] afford protection in every rite. {37.26}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the thumbs are placed upon the third joint of the ring fingers, and the index fingers form the shape of a needle, this is the mudrā of Samayoṣṇīṣa, invincible as a vajra and applicable to every type of samaya. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Oṁ, the samaya for prosperity! Svāhā!{37.27}</p>
<p>“If the tips of the thumbs are placed upon the middle joint of the ring fingers, and the index fingers, with their tips folded in, cling to the middle joint of the needle-shaped middle fingers, this is the mudrā of the invincible Mahā­samayoṣṇīṣa. When employed against the gods and the asuras, this [mudrā] establishes them in the samaya. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to the blessed, invincible uṣṇīṣa! Oṁ, the great samaya for prosperity! Svāhā!{37.28}</p>
<p>“Having bound the maṇḍala with this mudrā, one may recite, ‘Abide in the samaya, abide!’ addressing even the emperor; one may subdue other emperors, too. While mantras are being recited at that very place, whether worldly or supramundane, none will interfere with another or neutralize its power. [This is true] for all the reciters in a particular place. Starting with those just mentioned, there are innumerable uṣṇīṣa kings—one should practice the entire Tathāgata family at length. {37.29}</p>
<p>“Further, Mañjuśrī, there are, in this king of manuals, mantras that are infinitely profound and mudrās of many different kinds. I will now teach them in brief. If I were  to explain them in detail, no human or nonhuman being, not even in a thousand eons, would be able to grasp or remember them. I will therefore, Mañjuśrī, teach them in brief. Keep all of this in your memory. {37.30}</p>
<p>“The heart mudrās of the Sage</p>
<p>Are the most excellent taught in this manual.</p>
<p>After them, there are the mudrās</p>
<p>Of the cakravartin deities who surpass all gods. {37.31}</p>
<p>“The mudrās of the moon-like Avalokiteśvara,</p>
<p>Of the sagacious bodhisattva [Mañjuśrī],</p>
<p>And of Vajrapāṇi, the king of yakṣas,</p>
<p>Are said to be next. {37.32}</p>
<p>“After them come other mudrās</p>
<p>Of great power and energy,</p>
<p>Namely all those of the hosts of dūtas and dūtīs,</p>
<p>Followed by those of the ceṭas and ceṭīs, {37.33}</p>
<p>“The celestial yakṣas and yakṣiṇīs,</p>
<p>The nāgas and nāginīs,</p>
<p>The kiṃkaras and kiṃkarīs,</p>
<p>And the piśācas and piśācīs;{37.34}</p>
<p>“Of the powerful rākṣasīs</p>
<p>And other celestial ladies;</p>
<p>And of the wives of the daityas,</p>
<p>Of all the siddhas and vidyādharas, {37.35}</p>
<p>“And of all the human and nonhuman beings</p>
<p>Born in the threefold universe—</p>
<p>In short, the mudrās of all beings</p>
<p>That are designated to them individually. {37.36}</p>
<p>“Mantras, too, are of many types,</p>
<p>Accomplishing a variety of activities.</p>
<p>Whether in the Royal or Jewel families,</p>
<p>These mantras each have a corresponding mudrā. {37.37}</p>
<p>“The mudrās of the arhats or the pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>Both bring splendid results.</p>
<p>As for all the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Established on the ten levels, {37.38}</p>
<p>“Their heart mudrās and mantras</p>
<p>Are taught individually.</p>
<p>The mudrās in the family of the divine yakṣa,</p>
<p>A family worshiped by the ṛṣis and the gandharvas; {37.39}</p>
<p>“The mudrās taught as belonging to the seventh family</p>
<p>And relating to the gandharvas;</p>
<p>And likewise the mudrās in the eighth family,</p>
<p>Are [all] said to be for their [respective] families.{37.40}</p>
<p>“All the mudrās thus enumerated,</p>
<p>And the others named after the sugatas,</p>
<p>Are individually paired with mantras,</p>
<p>Both worldly and those related to the sugatas.{37.41}</p>
<p>“A mantra employed together with a mudrā</p>
<p>Is exceptionally powerful in the performance of rites.</p>
<p>The vināyakas will stay away from those who</p>
<p>Skillfully employ mudrās and so forth. {37.42}</p>
<p>“Now the descriptions of these and other such great mudrās will be given. First come the descriptions  of the heart mudrās of the blessed buddhas. {37.43}</p>
<p>“One should hold the fingers of both hands together, with the thumbs exposed to view. This is the heart mudrā of the tathāgatas. The same mudrā, but with only the right thumb showing, is the mudrā of Padmadhara. If one first makes the left and right hands into fists, and then relaxes and extends both the middle fingers to form the single form of a vajra, this is the mudrā of Vajradhara. {37.44}</p>
<p>“If one inclines the pointed tip [of the vajra] down, this is the mudrā of the bodhisattva Gandhahastin. If one subsequently raises [the hands] up and forms the shape of a circle, this is the mudrā of Gajagandha. If one then folds in one phalanx of each [middle finger], this is the mudrā of the Jewel family. It may be employed, in combination with the mantras of Jalendra and so forth, [to invoke] Jambhala and all the spirits of the Jewel family. {37.45}</p>
<p>“If the index fingers are each folded at two joints and touch each other at the fingernails, this is the mudrā of the five very powerful yakṣas and so forth, which belongs to the Yakṣa family. If [the index fingers] are joined at the fingernails and held above the fingernails of the thumbs, with the hands positioned as before and the middle fingers raised up to form the shape of a needle, this is the mudrā of all the gods who inhabit the celestial realms of Akaniṣṭha and so forth; it belongs to the Celestial family.{37.46}</p>
<p>“If one brings the hands together and makes them into fists with the thumbs exposed to view, this is the mudrā of the pratyeka­buddhas and noble śrāvakas. {37.47}</p>
<p>“The eight mudrās just mentioned</p>
<p>Belong to the eight families.</p>
<p>Now I will teach a single mudrā</p>
<p>That can be used for all the sons of the victors.{37.48}</p>
<p>“If [the hands] are extended in the añjali gesture</p>
<p>And then slightly contracted,</p>
<p>This is the mudrā, it is taught,</p>
<p>Of all the great bodhisattvas. {37.49}</p>
<p>“The seven mudrās of the Sage are those</p>
<p>Of the wish-fulfilling gem, the mendicant’s staff,</p>
<p>The monk’s shirt, the bowl, the robe,</p>
<p>The fangs, and the fearlessness. {37.50}</p>
<p>“The vision, the loving kindness, the aura of light, the webbed [fingers],</p>
<p>The [forty] teeth, the ūrṇā,  and the abiding in bliss</p>
<p>May also be regarded as mudrās</p>
<p>Arising from the Victor’s own body.{37.51}</p>
<p>“The above two heptads of mudrās,</p>
<p>Together with the five mudrās handed down by me</p>
<p>And the heart mudrā of the Sage,</p>
<p>Constitute twenty mudrās taught by the primordial, self-arisen ones. {37.52}</p>
<p>“These mudrās, formerly taught</p>
<p>By the primordial victors,</p>
<p>Are also referred to as the ‘retinue’</p>
<p>Of the twenty cakravartins.</p>
<p>The enumeration may continue on and on,</p>
<p>With each mudrā having a corresponding mantra. {37.53}</p>
<p>“If one raises [the hands] and cups them, this is the mudrā of the wish-fulfilling gem. If one makes [one’s hands] into fists and holds them, while sitting in a cross-legged position, at the left and right shoulders, this is the mudrā of the mendicant’s staff. If the hands face each other with a space in between, this is the mudrā of the monk’s shirt.{37.54}</p>
<p>“If the hollowed [hands are held] down below, this is the mudrā of the bowl. The mudrā of the robe is formed with the left hand. The mudrā of the fangs is formed out of the heart mudrā by raising the thumb of the left hand. In the mudrā of fearlessness, the [right] hand displays the gesture of granting fearlessness, while the left is supporting the robe.{37.55}</p>
<p>“If there is a hollow space between the middle fingers, the index fingers are folded outside and the thumbs placed inside, this is the mudrā of the Buddha’s eye. The same mudrā, but with the middle fingers folded at the joints and the index fingers at the side of them, is [the mudrā] of the Buddha’s loving kindness. If one forms the añjali gesture with the fingers splayed, and then forms a triple ‘needle’ by hiding away the index and ring fingers, this is the mudrā of Māmakī.{37.56}</p>
<p>“If one forms the añjali gesture, bends the index and middle fingers outward at the third joint, and joins the thumbs but keeps them apart from other fingers, this is the mudrā of Bhogavatī. The mudrā of Vijayā is formed with the index and middle finger of the left hand. With the three fingers of the right hand, one should display a vajra at the waist.{37.57}</p>
<p>“Similarly, one can accomplish all activities by forming,  above one’s head, the mudrā of the vidyārāja, which has the nature of the eight great mudrās. If one casts flowers onto the maṇḍala at the right time following the procedure as previously described, one will accomplish any activity according to one’s wish. Samayas are expressed by vidyās or mantras; when properly sealed with a mudrā, they become as powerful as the mudrā. Should one display a mudrā carelessly or at the wrong time and place, one would break one’s samaya.{37.58}</p>
<p>“As with the vajra, so with the trident—there is no difference between them—if it is raised, the [mudrā] is associated with Vajradhara; if lowered, with Maheśvara. If it is formed in the center, it is associated with the venerable masters and teachers as well as all humankind.{37.59}</p>
<p>If a single finger is raised up, this is the mudrā of all human beings and other two-legged, four-legged, multilegged, and legless creatures in the threefold universe. If two fingers are raised, this is the mudrā of all the yakṣas and yakṣiṇīs. If three are raised, this is the mudrā of all the vidyādharas and vidyādharīs. If four fingers are raised, evenly leveled with the palm, this is the mudrā of the male and female lower gods and asuras.{37.60}</p>
<p>“If the hands display a gracefully formed añjali gesture, this is the mudrā of all the gods inhabiting the realm of form. The same gesture is also the mudrā of the gods inhabiting the formless realm.{37.61}</p>
<p>“If the hands, positioned as before, are made into hollow fists, this is the mudrā of all worldly beings, starting from the lords of the realm of desire and all the beings dwelling there, including men, animals, pretas, and yāmas.{37.62}</p>
<p>“If one extends a single finger while forming the above mudrā, this is the mudrā of the piśācas and piśācīs. If one extends two fingers, this is the mudrā of the rākṣasas and rākṣasīs. If one extends three fingers, this is the mudrā of all the kravyādas and other carrion-eating spirits, the grahas, the mātṛs,  the kuṣmāṇḍas and so forth, the piśitāśas, all the ḍākinīs, the vyantaras, the kaśmalas, and others. If one forms four fingers into hooks, this is the mudrā of all the kaśmalas. {37.63}</p>
<p>“One performs summoning with the mudrās of summoning, and dismissing with the mudrās of dismissing. If one employs one’s own mind, one will accomplish all activities. Using only these mudrās according to need, one can combine them only with the mantras assigned to them. One must not use other [mudrās], or perform activities other than [those assigned to these mudrās]. One can only employ a mantra with whatever mudrās they are designated to. {37.64}</p>
<p>“These mudrās, blessed by all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Must not be used in a transgressive way.</p>
<p>Through merely beholding the mudrā,</p>
<p>No being will be capable of feeling anger.{37.65}</p>
<p>“Those who use the mudrās transgressively will perish. By violating a mudrā one breaks one’s samaya and transgresses against all the vidyās. The violator will certainly fall into the Raurava or Avīci hell. Creators of obstacles will fall deep down into one of the great hells. Those, on the other hand, who keep their samayas regarding the mudrās will experience long-lasting great happiness, will be reborn in the gods’ realms, and will certainly progress toward the final goal of awakening. {37.66}</p>
<p>“In short, many different types of mudrās have been taught by the primordial buddhas and the bodhisattvas of great power. It is impossible for any being to fathom, enumerate, or learn them. {37.67}</p>
<p>“Briefly, there is in the family of the Victorious One a single-syllable mantra, the vidyārāja, the cakravartin. Its corresponding mudrā, used for protection, is formed as follows: First one should make the left and right hands into fists, except for the middle fingers, which should be extended forth together, each bent at the first joint. As for the index fingers, each should be bent at both joints and touch the other at the fingernail. [Their tips] should be above the fingernails of the thumbs.  This mudrā of the cakravartin [One Syllable] is suitable for all activities. It was declared by the protectors of the world to be the best of all mudrās. {37.68}</p>
<p>“When this mudrā is employed with the previously described cakravartin One Syllable, it can accomplish all activities. When [One Syllable] is accomplished, the entire Tathāgata family is accomplished, and all the worldly and supramundane mantras are accomplished. When One Syllable is recited, all the mantras are recited. {37.69}</p>
<p>“As for the other eminent mantra [deities] invoked in this king of manuals, the practitioner should always recite [their] mantras one thousand and eight times to start with. In this way, all these vidyā deities will be experienced directly and will soon grant accomplishments and boons. One will steadily progress toward awakening. {37.70}</p>
<p>“One will accomplish all activities by combining the one-syllable heart mantra of Avalokiteśvara with the mudrā of Padmadhara, or by combining the vidyā of Pāṇḍaravāsinī with her mudrā—so also, by combining the mudrā of Vajradhara with his one-syllable heart mantra, or by combining the mudrā of Māmakī with her great vidyā. {37.71}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the Royal family, [one will accomplish all activities by combining] the one-syllable heart mantra of the bodhisattva Gajagandha with his mudrā. Also, regarding the Jewel, the Yakṣa, the Celestial, and the Noble families, one will accomplish all activities by combining the one-syllable heart mantras of these families with their respective mudrās. In this way, one will always be able to accomplish all activities using any of these mudrās and mantras. The power of the vidyā mantras will be directed according to how they are employed. Activities will not be accomplished any other way.{37.72}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the right hand raised in a svasti gesture [should be combined with the mantra] of Brahmā Sahāmpati; the single liṅga mudrā, [with the mantra] of Maheśvara; the discus mudrā, [with the mantra] of Viṣṇu; the añjali gesture with the fingers splayed, [with the mantra] of Garutman; a hand raised in a cursing gesture, [with the mantra] of the ṛṣis. The same applies to the mudrā of the gandharvas, the lower gods, and the asuras, which is formed by placing the tip of the left thumb inside a fist. The mudrā of the four virgins, again, can be combined only with the corresponding mantra.{37.73}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the spear mudrā [should be combined with the mantra] of Kārttikeya. The same applies to the mudrās of Yama, Varuṇa, Kubera, and the yakṣas, rākṣasas, piśācas, and mahoragas—all the beings inhabiting the threefold universe, following the course of whatever destiny, and reborn in whatever realm—the grahas, mātṛs, kravyādas, kaśmalas, and so forth. All these beings have mudrās and mantras designated to them, which must be employed observing the right correspondence. Everything must follow the right order, not otherwise. {37.74}</p>
<p>“First of all, the practitioner should rely on the auspicious mudrās and their corresponding mantras, as taught in this king of manuals, that represent the way of the tathāgatas. Also, Mañjuśrī, there are the mudrās of the noble bodhisattvas Samantabhadra, Mahā­sthāna­prāpta, and Vimalagati, as well as your utpala mudrā. These mudrās, of both the tathāgatas and the bodhisattvas, should always be displayed by the practitioner facing the east. Having gotten up early, he should stand facing the sun in a clean place and, himself clean, should display any one of these mudrās, raising it upward, above his head. {37.75}</p>
<p>“Any of the corresponding mantras should be recited one hundred and eight times. He will be free from all disease, will live long, and will not be overcome by the vighnas. He will become unassailable by any living being. He will meet, face to face, all the mantra [deities] who will promptly grant him accomplishment. He will receive blessings from all the buddhas and will steadily progress toward awakening. The divine youth Mañjuśrī will himself become his spiritual friend until the attainment of full realization. What, then, are these mudrās and mantras?{37.76}</p>
<p>“First, I will teach the mudrā of the great hero. One should join the cupped hands folding the fingers in and raising up the thumbs bent where they meet the wrist. This is the mudrā of the great hero, taught by all the tathāgatas.  The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Āḥ hero! Hūṁ khaṁ!</p>
<p>“If combined with this mantra, the mudrā of the great hero will accomplish all activities. {37.77}</p>
<p>“Having joined the cupped hands as before, one should open them with the fingers expanded all around into the shape of a blooming lotus. This excellent mudrā, introduced by the primordial buddhas, is called blooming. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you who originate from the sky! Be bright, be! Spread light, spread! You are blessed by the buddhas! Illuminate all the buddhas! Hūṁ hūṁ, Vikāsinī! Phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!{37.78}</p>
<p>“This mantra, when employed in combination with its namesake mudrā, is suitable for all activities. It points out those who are possessed by grahas. It causes those possessed, whether it is by grahas, kravyādas, or kaśmalas, or those knocked out by poison, to speak. Following the manner of its employment, it will fulfill all the required activities accordingly. In short, this vidyā, when employed along with the blooming mudrā, will fulfill all aims; it will swiftly bring the desired result even if it is not fully mastered. {37.79}</p>
<p>“If one joins the cupped hands together with the fingers evenly folded, this is the heart mudrā [of the tathāgatas]. This heart [mudrā] should be incanted seven times with the [corresponding] heart mantra, and then ‘released.’ The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, brave Godari, svāhā!</p>
<p>“This is the heart mantra of the tathāgatas. {37.80}</p>
<p>“If one joins the cupped hands as before, with the fingers set apart so that there is free space between the fingertips, this is the uṣṇīṣa mudrā. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ droṁ! Bind! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“This mantra is suitable for all activities. {37.81}</p>
<p>“If one makes the right hand into a fist with the thumb free, this is the mudrā of the mendicant’s staff. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, shake [them]! You are invincible in battle, hūṁ!</p>
<p>“This mantra of the mendicant’s staff is suitable for all activities. {37.82}</p>
<p>“If the same mudrā is formed with the left hand touching the robe, this is the mudrā of the robe. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, protect [me], protect! O my robe, blessed by all the buddhas, svāhā!</p>
<p>“With this mudrā of the robe of the Tathāgata one can accomplish all activities.  If one wears a robe incanted with the corresponding mantra, one will enjoy good fortune and powerful protection. All the grahas, mātṛs, piśitāśas, kravyādas, kaśmalas, and vighnas will flee upon merely seeing [such a robe]. {37.83}</p>
<p>“If the thumb of the left hand and the small finger of the right mutually touch, and the hands are lowered down with a hollow space between them, this is the mudrā of the bowl. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, O buddha bowl of great power, you are blessed by the protectors of the world! Hold, hold, and cause [the contents] to be held! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“This mantra, when combined with the mudrā, is suitable for all activities. If one recollects [this mantra] at the time of eating, one will not be affected by any poison that one might swallow. {37.84}</p>
<p>“If one makes the hands into fists, with the index fingers bent at the middle joint, this is the mudrā of the wish-fulfilling gem. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ splendor, blaze! You who fulfill all aims. Bring success, bring! O wish-fulfilling gem, huṁ!</p>
<p>“This mantra of the wish-fulfilling gem, when combined with its namesake mudrā, will accomplish all activities splendidly.{37.85}</p>
<p>“By incanting with this mantra all one’s ornaments and decorations and putting them on, one ensures a powerful protection for one’s body, and one attains supreme good fortune. If one enters a battle, having donned the ornaments and incanted the armor, no weapon will be able to strike one’s body and one will be unassailable by one’s enemies. One will protect one’s own army and defeat the enemy army. One will accomplish these and innumerable other feats, even if one has not mastered them previously. {37.86}</p>
<p>“If one takes a ruby, an emerald, or other type of precious stone, incants it one hundred and eight times and places it at the tip of a banner, on one’s head, or on an elephant’s back, one will not be taken prisoner when one enters the front lines of a battle. Seeing [the incanted gem], the enemy army will certainly be crushed without any fight or will fall into a heavy stupor. The defeated troops will flee, and so will their leader. {37.87}</p>
<p>“If one forms the hands into mutually touching fists with the index fingers bent at the middle joint, on the level with the third joint on the middle fingers, this is the mudrā of the Dharma wheel. The corresponding mantra, the mantra of the Dharma wheel, is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ blazing circle! Chop up, break, strike, burn, burn! Huṁ!{37.88}</p>
<p>“If one is firmly set with the left foot outstretched, the right knee touching the ground, the left [hand] extended backward, and the right poised to deliver a blow, this is the mudrā of Aparājitā. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, hulu hulu! O caṇḍālī, O mātaṅgī!Svāhā!</p>
<p>“The mantra of Aparājitā and the mantra the Dharma wheel are suitable for all activities if used in combination with their corresponding mudrās. In short, they will remove all suffering. Whatever activities they are employed for, they will accomplish all of them. {37.89}</p>
<p>“One should place the left hand in the lap and display with the right [the gesture] of teaching the Dharma. This is the spear mudrā of the tathāgatas. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“OṁVijayā of great power, difficult to resist! Hūṁ phaṭ! O Victorious One, phaṭ! O auspicious one, phaṭ!</p>
<p>“[This mantra of] the spear of the tathāgatas, when employed with its [namesake] mudrā, can accomplish all activities. It can paralyze all the vighnas, evil beings, and enemies, as well as all the gods. Its qualities are infinite. Whatever activities it is employed for, it will accomplish all of them. {37.90}</p>
<p>“One should interlace the fingers of the hands with the palms facing upward and the index fingers touching at the tips to form the shape of a needle. This mudrā, turned around so that the palms face downward, should be displayed at the forehead. This is the ūrṇā mudrā of the blessed buddhas, taught by the primordial buddhas. The corresponding mantra is, ‘Homage to all the worthy tathāgatas, the fully realized buddhas.’ [The portion to be recited is]:</p>
<p>“He he! Bind, bind! Remain, remain! Support, support! Suppress, suppress! O jewel of the ūrṇā, svāhā!</p>
<p>“This mantra of the ūrṇā of the tathāgatas, when employed along with its [namesake] mudrā, can accomplish all activities. {37.91}</p>
<p>“If one steps into the midst of one’s enemies wearing a bindi on one’s forehead made with bovine bezoar [incanted with the ūrṇā mantra] and reciting [the same], one will be unassailable by any  wicked beings and will not be harmed by them. Or, if one enters the middle of a battlefield, one will cause, merely by one’s gaze, the destruction of the enemy army. If one does not fail to display [the bindi], one can accomplish feats without limit. This [ūrṇā] has been taught by innumerable blessed buddhas. {37.92}</p>
<p>“One should form the añjali gesture with the hands joined together without any gaps. The two index fingers should be bent at the middle joint. The thumbs should also be bent. This is the mudrā of the eye of the tathāgatas. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, ru ru! Flash, blaze, and stay on! O Siddhalocanā who accomplishes all purposes, svāhā!</p>
<p>“This mantra of the eye of the tathāgatas, when employed along with its namesake mudrā, can accomplish all activities. {37.93}</p>
<p>“If one enters among one’s enemies, having incanted one’s eyes [with the eye mantra of the tathāgatas], they will lose their anger upon merely being looked at. Filled with loving kindness, they will harbor good wishes and will become friends. Or, if one gazes at one’s enemies when in the vanguard of the battle after incanting one’s eyes, they will become kindly disposed. Unable to raise their weapons in assault, they will turn back without any fight and subsequently turn into allies. {37.94}</p>
<p>“If the hands are positioned horizontally and form the shape of a book with the opposite fingertips touching, this is the mudrā of Prajñāpāramitā. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Homage to you, blessed goddess beautiful to look at! Oṁ tha!</p>
<p>“This [mantra of] Blessed Prajñāpāramitā, when employed along with its namesake mudrā, can accomplish all activities. {37.95}</p>
<p>“If one touches one’s heart while reciting [the mantra just described], one will increase one’s powers of recollection. If, while reciting, one enters into the midst of wicked enemies, one will deprive them of the ability to think. In the heat of a battle, one will be able to stupefy one’s adversaries, whether they are two-legged or four-legged, or make them lose their minds. In short, whatever activities the blessed goddess is employed for, she will accomplish all of them.  The qualities of this [mantra] are infinite, and so are its ritual applications. {37.96}</p>
<p>“The mudrās and mantras of the tathāgatas are infinite. One should employ [primarily] all the mudrās and mantras of the [deities] listed in the ‘Assembly’ chapter as the retinue deities of the tathāgatas, as the rites of other [deities] are innumerable. These mudrās and mantras should be employed according to the ritual of this king of manuals. {37.97}</p>
<p>“Thus, the mantra of the Lotus family should be used together with the padma mudrā. This mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ jiḥ jiḥ! Svāhā to the dispeller of fear, one with the body of a victorious one!</p>
<p>“This is the mantra of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. When employed together with the padma mudrā, it will accomplish all activities. When it is recited, all the mantras of the Lotus family are being recited. When it is accomplished, all the mantras of the Lotus family are accomplished. {37.98}</p>
<p>“The mantra to be used with [the mudrā] of the great vidyā Pāṇḍaravāsinī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ kaṭe vikaṭe nikaṭe kaṭaṅkaṭe kaṭavikaṭa­kaṭaṅkaṭe svāhā!</p>
<p>“[This mantra], when combined with the mudrā of Pāṇḍaravāsinī or the padma mudrā, can accomplish all activities. It also affords protection to those visiting any of the charnel grounds. {37.99}</p>
<p>“Similarly, Tārā, Bhṛkuṭī, Candrā, any deities said to be from the retinue of the lord of vidyās Hayagrīva, as well as the entire Lotus family in its infinity, may be invoked by the means of the mantras and mudrās along with their extensive rituals.{37.100}</p>
<p>“The same applies to the Vajra family where the mantra is used together with the double vajra mudrā. This mantra is:</p>
<p>“Hūṁ!</p>
<p>“When this mantra of Vajrapāṇi is accomplished, all the mantras of the Vajra family are accomplished. When this mantra is recited, all of them are recited. When employed along with previously described double vajra mudrā, this mantra will accomplish all the activities the practitioner desires, even those forbidden by the most eminent of victors, if they are required to guide sentient beings. This mantra of the great yakṣa is extremely fierce. {37.101}</p>
<p>“Similarly, [the mudrā] of Māmakī, the great vidyā who is the mainstay of the [Vajra] family, can accomplish all activities. The corresponding mantra is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ maintainer of the family! Bind, bind! Huṁ phaṭ!</p>
<p>“This great vidyā called Māmakī, taught by all the buddhas, is suitable for all activities. When employed together with the mudrā of Māmakī formed in advance, it can accomplish any activity according to the practitioner’s wish. One can also employ the mudrās of the retinue [deities] of Vajrapāṇi as listed in the introductory chapter, as well as the entire vajra holder’s family without exception, in combination with their respective mantras. {37.102}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the Elephant family, there is, the mantra of the bodhisattva Gajagandha:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you with an elephant’s name, hūṁ! You who walk in the sky, svāhā!</p>
<p>“When [this mantra] is employed along with the previously described mudrā, it will accomplish all activities. Just as before, when this mantra is accomplished, the whole family is accomplished. {37.103}</p>
<p>“So also [is the case with] the mantras of Samantabhadra, Mahā­sthāna­prāpta, and Vimalagati, which are, [respectively:]</p>
<p>“Oṁ, son of the victors! The same and not the same! Do not delay! Hūṁ phaṭ!;</p>
<p>“Remain, remain in the exalted place! Having attained awakening, remember your samaya! Hūṁ, phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!;</p>
<p>“and</p>
<p>“Oṁ, stainless, stainless! With stainless form! Burn, burn! Remember your samaya, svāhā!{37.104}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Gaganagañja can accomplish all activities if employed with the mudrā of any bodhisattva. This applies also to all the innumerable great bodhisattvas who have attained the tenth bodhisattva level, starting with Apāyajaha, Sadāprarudita, Kṣitigarbha, Ratnapāṇi, and Maitreya. Their mudrās and mantras are, likewise, innumerable. They ought to be employed [as instructed] in this king of manuals. {37.105}</p>
<p>“The detailed section on all the mantras and mudrās covers a vast range of the worldly ones and the different levels of the supramundane. All the rites and their variants taught in this [manual] entail a samaya of the great assembly and require accomplishing all the relevant mantras.{37.106}</p>
<p>“These mudrās and mantras should thus be employed according to their family association, whether the Jewel, the Yakṣa, the Celestial, or the Noble family. However, all these mantras and mudrās in all the tantras in the three times constitute but one family, which is none other than the Tathāgata family. And you too, Mañjuśrī, divine youth, may be regarded as belonging to the Tathāgata family. {37.107}</p>
<p>“You should remember, Mañjuśrī, that all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, noble śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas; all the worldly and supramundane mantra [deities], whether subject to karmic influences or not; and all the different mudrās—all of them belong to the families of the tathāgatas.  There is no such mudrā, Mañjuśrī, or esoteric mantra system, that would not belong to a tathāgata family or have no samaya bond with a tathāgata. Know, divine youth, that they are connected. {37.108}</p>
<p>“Just as the Tathāgata is said to be at the forefront, so is the Tathāgata family said to be at the forefront. Therefore, Mañjuśrī, this king of manuals is the jewel of the most eminent of families. It was taught, elucidated, established, and propagated by the past buddhas since time immemorial. {37.109}</p>
<p>“This king of manuals was taught by Blessed Saṃkusumita Rāja, Blessed Śālarājendra, Blessed Saṃkusumita­gandhottama Rāja, Blessed Ratnaketu, Blessed Amitābha, Blessed Puṇyābha, [Blessed] Kusumottama, [Blessed] Saṃkusuma, [Blessed] Supuṣpa, [Blessed] Amitāyurjñāna­viniścaya­rājendra, [Blessed] Kanakamuni, [Blessed] Kāśyapa, [Blessed] Krakucchanda, [Blessed] Śikhin, [Blessed] Viśvabhū, Blessed Konākamuni, and also by me, Śākyamuni. It was taught before and will be taught again. {37.110}</p>
<p>“In this way, O divine youth Mañjuśrī, this sovereign manual of your rites has been passed down by the succession of buddhas. It is the prime jewel of the Tathāgata family that brings great benefits. It is necessarily rooted in the sphere of phenomena. It is not possible to describe its benefits even in a thousand eons, or to fully describe its great qualities. Not even the likes of you could describe or communicate the experiences to be had in this world, or those related to the future state of awakening, its ultimate goal.{37.111}</p>
<p>“The extent of the great qualities of this manual and the ensuing results are immeasurable. They relate to both this existence and the hereafter. If any persons, full of trust and free from doubt, should memorize and propagate [this manual], apply themselves to its diverse practices, accomplish [its] mantras or [just] recite them, display [its] mudrās, applying themselves continually, such persons would exhibit the following eight qualities:{37.112}</p>
<p>“(1) They would obtain special qualities and benefits. (2) They would be unfazed by their adversaries and have no fear therefrom. (3) Their bodies would be immune to poison and invulnerable to weapons. (4) They would be blessed by the buddhas  and bodhisattvas and have long life, comforts, and intelligence. (5) The divine youth Mañjuśrī would become their spiritual friend and would appear to them in their dreams at night. (6) All the mantra [deities] would protect them and reveal to them their mudrās in their dreams. 7) No evil kings, wicked beings, or other ill-wishers would be able to harm them. (8) They would certainly be destined for awakening.{37.113}</p>
<p>“These eight benefits will manifest for those with faith and no doubts, who earnestly apply themselves to the practice—householders or renunciants, women or men—if they follow the instructions. They will not manifest for others. For those engaging in evil actions the opposite will happen; they will proceed downward into the Raurava and other hells. {37.114}</p>
<p>“As has been said, displaying the mudrās in the forenoon is conducive to long life. One should respectfully display the mudrās of the uṣṇīṣa [kings], and of Locanā and the others, while reciting the heart mantras of the deities from the retinue of the Tathāgata. They are of the same efficacy and power as your mudrās and mantras, O divine youth Mañjuśrī. {37.115}</p>
<p>“As has been said, one should be clean and be in a clean place. The intermediate area should be free from thorns, smeared with cow dung that has not fallen, and strewn with sweet-smelling white flowers. Standing there, one should recite the mantra and display the mudrā—not anywhere else, and not [the mantras and mudrās] of other [deities], but a single mantra out of those [specified], accompanied by [its respective] mudrā. {37.116}</p>
<p>“As said before, one should be clean. When the sun has set, one should wash oneself in pure water, free of living organisms, and put on fresh clothes. One should perform the uṣṇīṣa protection, and one should avoid sexual activity, be morally upright, and joyfully guard one’s purity and virtue. {37.117}</p>
<p>“The protection effected by the uṣṇīṣa</p>
<p>Should be followed by creating a [protected] circle</p>
<p>Where, during sleep after the first watch of the night,</p>
<p>One should contemplate the tathāgatas. {37.118}</p>
<p>“One should obtain a thread spun by a virgin girl, or a brahmin girl who has never experienced sexual pleasure, and incant it one hundred and eight times with the mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, seize, seize! Bind, bind! Arrester of semen and fulfiller of aims, svāhā!</p>
<p>“One should recite this mantra while displaying the mudrā of Māmakī and then tie the thread around one’s hips. If one wraps it around three times, the semen will be arrested.{37.119}</p>
<p>“Not even the lord of the realm of desire will be able to disturb one’s mind during sleep, so how could the dream-framing vināyakas do it? Through this method, and not without it, neither the daughters of the ṛṣis nor the daughters of the lord of the realm of desire, who assume various forms to excite passions, will be able to disturb one’s mind, even if normally one has passions and is not free from them, so how could other women, whether human or nonhuman, disturb it? {37.120}</p>
<p>“Applying this procedure, one should rise early, go to the toilet, brush one’s teeth, rinse one’s mouth, and wash oneself, as before, in clean water free of living organisms. Facing the east, one should display the mudrā and recite the mantra. {37.121}</p>
<p>“As a consequence, one will enjoy a long life and proficiency in all types of activity. One will be free from all major diseases and will be loved by everybody. One’s enemies will become one’s friends. Through merely seeing [the mudrā], all the grahas, kravyādas, kaśmalas, and so forth will flee. The enemy army will become paralyzed. Through merely displaying [the mudrā], one will accomplish any activity. One thus has a choice between the procedure that is pure, or the impure lack of it.{37.122}</p>
<p>“This king of manuals is filled with infinite sets of mudrās and mantras, which have been and will be taught by innumerable blessed buddhas. I too—Tathāgata Śākyamuni, a worthy, fully realized buddha—have just now taught them in the midst of this great assembly. {37.123}</p>
<p>“You also, Mañjuśrī, divine youth, will engage in the task of safeguarding these instructions and safeguarding the domain of the teachings over the long period of time when I have passed into nirvāṇa, dissolved into the ultimate reality, and attained the complete peace of the final state. {37.124}</p>
<p>“As the end of an eon is now setting in, at this terrible time I taught this with my mind overcome by great compassion,  for the benefit of beings. I taught this king of manuals in order to restrain and guide those who offend against the Three Jewels—the evil kings and the wicked beings. I taught this king of manuals with its detailed sections for the sake of all beings.” {37.125}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on the ritual procedures that prescribe the mantras and the mudrās, thirty-seventh in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 38</p>
<p>At that time the blessed Śākyamuni again directed his gaze at the realm of the Pure Abode and spoke to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth:</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī!</p>
<p>“Briefly, there are detailed [teachings on] the characteristics of the mudrās and the mantras, the procedures of the maṇḍalas and the association-based distribution of mudrās therein, and the secret maṇḍala of all the mantra [deities] in all the tantras.{38.1}</p>
<p>“All of them were taught before</p>
<p>By every buddha of great majesty.</p>
<p>The exalted function of the mantras</p>
<p>Was explained for each of the families</p>
<p>By the former buddhas from the earliest time</p>
<p>To bring benefit to sentient beings. {38.2}</p>
<p>“Having set in motion the mantra wheel,</p>
<p>Which constitutes the supreme wheel of the Dharma,</p>
<p>They dissolved into the ultimate reality,</p>
<p>Mounted upon the wheel of peace.</p>
<p>All these buddhas, very powerful in the world,</p>
<p>Entered the peace [of nirvāṇa]. {38.3}</p>
<p>“All this was formerly taught</p>
<p>By the tathāgatas since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>I, too, will teach it [now] in this final world,</p>
<p>Putting my trust, Mañju, in you.” {38.4}</p>
<p>The divine youth Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Hearing these words</p>
<p>Of the buddha of great splendor,</p>
<p>Folded his hands before him, {38.5}</p>
<p>And said to the best of speakers,</p>
<p>The fully realized buddha, supreme among two-legged beings,</p>
<p>“Teach the Dharma, O sagacious one,</p>
<p>To bring benefit to the world! {38.6}</p>
<p>“Teach it in a succinct manner, without elaborating,</p>
<p>Causing the greatness of its qualities to bear fruit.”</p>
<p>Having said this,</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī remained silent. {38.7}</p>
<p>The glorious great lord</p>
<p>With a voice as sweet as a cuckoo</p>
<p>Taught then everything that pertains</p>
<p>To the distribution of mudrās in the maṇḍala. {38.8}</p>
<p>Staying above the realm of the Pure Abode,</p>
<p>The Lion of the Śākyas, the best of men,</p>
<p>The fully realized buddha, [also] taught, at that time,</p>
<p>The [relevant] mantra system. {38.9}</p>
<p>“Listen, Mañjuśrī, divine youth,</p>
<p>About the mudrās with their procedures,</p>
<p>And about the mantras employed in tantric methods.</p>
<p>Hear the full account of the greatness of their qualities! {38.10}</p>
<p>“First of all, there are signs that indicate</p>
<p>Whether something is a living being or not;</p>
<p>[They include] form, actions, behavior,</p>
<p>And all the gestures and speech. {38.11}</p>
<p>“These gestures may involve both hands, both feet,</p>
<p>The head, or the fingers of each hand.</p>
<p>All of them were designated as mudrā</p>
<p>By the primordial buddhas of yore. {38.12}</p>
<p>“They are the pitcher,</p>
<p>Parasol, lotus, banner, flag,</p>
<p>Fish, vajra, conch,</p>
<p>Jar, wheel, {38.13}</p>
<p>“[And the mudrās named after] different weapons and implements—</p>
<p>As many as there are known in the world—</p>
<p>Including the mudrā shaped like a blue lotus,</p>
<p>All of them are arranged around the maṇḍala. {38.14}</p>
<p>“They are arranged in sequence,</p>
<p>As specified in the instructions.</p>
<p>Each of them should always be drawn</p>
<p>With its own respective form. {38.15}</p>
<p>“When talking about the mudrās in the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>They are each placed</p>
<p>In their own dedicated slot,</p>
<p>Where they are known to belong. {38.16}</p>
<p>“In all the maṇḍalas,</p>
<p>One must use the right mudrā form;</p>
<p>Cakravartin is thus represented by the wheel.</p>
<p>If the uṣṇīṣa lord is Sitātapatra, {38.17}</p>
<p>“One should draw a white parasol</p>
<p>In the most prominent place in the maṇḍala.</p>
<p>The Dharma wheel represents the buddhas,</p>
<p>And the lotus, the Lotus family. {38.18}</p>
<p>“The vajra is said to represent the Vajra family;</p>
<p>The elephant, the Elephant family;</p>
<p>And the jar, the Jewel family.</p>
<p>These allocations apply to every maṇḍala. {38.19}</p>
<p>“The two eminent families, the Celestial and the Noble,</p>
<p>Should be drawn as the endless knot and swastika respectively.</p>
<p>To represent the distinguished yakṣa family,</p>
<p>One should draw a fruit that is a source of phalaja.{38.20}</p>
<p>“To represent Mahābrahmā, one should draw a swan;</p>
<p>For Śakra, one should draw his thunderbolt.</p>
<p>To represent Maheśvara, one should draw his trident,</p>
<p>And in addition, his bull.{38.21}</p>
<p>“The trident is a three-pointed lance.</p>
<p>For Skanda, one should draw a [one-pointed] lance;</p>
<p>For Viṣṇu, a discus;</p>
<p>And for the dānavas, a mace. {38.22}</p>
<p>“The deities have various weapons</p>
<p>And assume different bodily positions.</p>
<p>They also have different vehicles,</p>
<p>Which should always be drawn in the center.{38.23}</p>
<p>“Conveying their form by means of an image,</p>
<p>One should draw, in every maṇḍala,</p>
<p>One of these [deities],</p>
<p>Whichever one is appropriate. {38.24}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍalas taught by the supreme victors</p>
<p>May have one, two, three,</p>
<p>Or an infinite number [of deities],</p>
<p>Arranged to resemble the rows of an altar.{38.25}</p>
<p>“[The deity] indicated for a given maṇḍala</p>
<p>Should be placed in the center;</p>
<p>If [the maṇḍala] is the ‘womb’ of the victors’ family,</p>
<p>One should paint, in the very center, the Buddha. {38.26}</p>
<p>“One should thus draw the image</p>
<p>Of the Teacher right in the center.</p>
<p>Second, one should draw [the deity] of the Lotus family,</p>
<p>And third, [the deity of] the Vajra family. {38.27}</p>
<p>“Having drawn all of this, one should add,</p>
<p>Following the right order, the gods and the asuras,</p>
<p>And then, filling the entire area,</p>
<p>The yakṣas, rākṣasas, and humans. {38.28}</p>
<p>“Next, one should draw,</p>
<p>In the right order, the tīrthikas,</p>
<p>And also the guardians of the quarters,</p>
<p>All of them in their respective places.{38.29}</p>
<p>“In short, one may draw a maṇḍala</p>
<p>Starting from a single dot or two,</p>
<p>Up to infinity, until the quarters are filled</p>
<p>Up to their farthest limits. {38.30}</p>
<p>“The earth is said to be infinite,</p>
<p>And so can be the surface of the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Starting from a single dot or two,</p>
<p>And extending over the entire earth.{38.31}</p>
<p>“Based on the instructions,</p>
<p>The maṇḍala procedure is said to be</p>
<p>Of three kinds, known as</p>
<p>The highest, the medium, and the lowest. {38.32}</p>
<p>“The highest procedure results in the highest accomplishment.</p>
<p>If the procedure is medium, the accomplishment is said to be middling.</p>
<p>The lowest procedure results in an inferior accomplishment,</p>
<p>As was formerly taught by the supreme victors. {38.33}</p>
<p>“The supreme victors also explained</p>
<p>The threefold accomplishment based on mental capacity:</p>
<p>Great beings attain great accomplishment,</p>
<p>And the mediocre, the middling.</p>
<p>The third accomplishment, that of minor beings,</p>
<p>Is taught for the minor activities. {38.34}</p>
<p>“When one’s thoughts [are suffused with] faith,</p>
<p>One is of the highest capacity and will definitely obtain</p>
<p>Final buddhahood with its attendant rewards</p>
<p>Through merely seeing the maṇḍala. {38.35}</p>
<p>“Those of the middling mental capacity will attain,</p>
<p>At that time, the realization of a pratyeka­buddha.</p>
<p>The remaining ones, because of their lack of devotion,</p>
<p>Are bound for the state of a śrāvaka.{38.36}</p>
<p>“This is not unfruitful, as the proclaimed result</p>
<p>[Of the śrāvaka path]—the peaceful destiny [of nirvāṇa]—is exalted.</p>
<p>If one merely sees the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>One is bound to attain birth in the divine realms. {38.37}</p>
<p>“Similarly, all the excellent mudrās</p>
<p>And the mantras, in all their vastness,</p>
<p>Can be employed in three different ways;</p>
<p>In terms of bringing happiness, they are divided into three categories.</p>
<p>The mudrās and the maṇḍalas having already been described,</p>
<p>[Now] the benefits of mantras are being told. {38.38}</p>
<p>“Starting from One Syllable,</p>
<p>And as far as the count goes,</p>
<p>However many [types of] speech</p>
<p>Are known [to be used] in the mantras,{38.39}</p>
<p>“[Whether it is] ordinary speech,</p>
<p>Lamentation, weeping, laughter, wailing,</p>
<p>Or any [other kind of] speaking or talking,</p>
<p>All of them have their place in the mantras. {38.40}</p>
<p>“These mantras are of three kinds—</p>
<p>The same three categories</p>
<p>That have been taught for the maṇḍalas</p>
<p>Apply also to the mudrās and the mantras. {38.41}</p>
<p>“The relevant procedures</p>
<p>Taught by the guides of the world</p>
<p>Are, in the same way, threefold,</p>
<p>And further still, manifold or thousandfold. {38.42}</p>
<p>“While being of three kinds, or falling into three categories,</p>
<p>They are also twofold, or of infinite types.</p>
<p>The mantra is coextensive with the mind</p>
<p>And never separate from the mind. {38.43}</p>
<p>“One who employs the mantra,</p>
<p>Blending it with the mind, will succeed.</p>
<p>Whatever mantras there are in the Tathāgata</p>
<p>Or the Lotus families, {38.44}</p>
<p>“Or those chanted in the Vajra</p>
<p>Or other families,</p>
<p>Including all the worldly mantras,</p>
<p>All of them arise from the [mind].{38.45}</p>
<p>“If one studiously recites any mantra</p>
<p>From the Victor’s family that was taught</p>
<p>For the sake of beings by the victors’ sons,</p>
<p>One will certainly become a buddha.{38.46}</p>
<p>“If one reverently recites</p>
<p>The mantras of the middle category,</p>
<p>One will definitely acquire the family status</p>
<p>Referred to as pratyeka­buddha. {38.47}</p>
<p>“A mantra reciter studiously engaged</p>
<p>In reciting other mantras,</p>
<p>Such as those taught by the noble śrāvakas</p>
<p>And the worldly mantras that are essentially virtuous,</p>
<p>Will certainly acquire the family status</p>
<p>Of a śrāvaka of great power. {38.48}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the rites may be divided</p>
<p>Into the highest, the medium, and the inferior.</p>
<p>The rites of pacifying lead to the realization of a buddha;</p>
<p>Those of nourishing, to the realization of a rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddha.</p>
<p>Those that involve minor mantras</p>
<p>Are said to lead to the realization of a śrāvaka. {38.49}</p>
<p>“In this context, the mind should also</p>
<p>Be regarded as being of three types,</p>
<p>But can be further subdivided into many,</p>
<p>Even infinite, types.” {38.50}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter on all the ritual procedures involving the mudrā and the maṇḍala methods, thirty-eighth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 50</p>
<p>At that time Blessed Vajrapāṇi, the general of the yakṣas who was in the assembly, got up from his seat, draped his upper robe over the left shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, bowed to the Blessed One with his palms pressed together, and made the following request: {50.1}</p>
<p>“O Blessed One! You have not fully explained the ritual of the lord of wrath called Yamāntaka that was taught by Mañjuśrī, the divine youth. Nor has Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, explained it. I request you, Blessed One, to teach this ritual, out of regard for human beings during the final age, so that, at the time when you are in the state of complete nirvāṇa, when the teachings have disappeared, during the dreadful time of the worst age when the buddhafield is completely devoid of śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas, the teachings of the tathāgatas may be preserved, the domain of the Dharma may remain for a long time, all wicked kings may be subdued, those who harm the Three Jewels may be suppressed, the inconceivable bodhisattva conduct may bring the virtues of beings who require guidance to completion, and innumerable sentient beings may be brought to complete maturity. {50.2}</p>
<p>“During the final eon, Blessed One, when the final age has arrived in which the Sugata’s instructions perish,  should one practice this rite of the wrathful lord Yamāntaka correctly, one will attain accomplishment. And this lord of wrath should always be used against none other than those evil kings and sentient beings who harm the teachings, such as the great yakṣas who are extremely powerful and engage in acts of oppression or assistance but lack great compassion.” {50.3}</p>
<p>The Blessed One, remaining silent, entered the samādhi called the buddha’s blessing through miraculous transformation. The divine youth Mañjuśrī, too, remained silent. The entire assembly and its surroundings began to shake in six different ways. {50.4}</p>
<p>The hosts of divine beings, all the youthful lords,</p>
<p>Were alarmed and terrified.</p>
<p>All the gods, the nāgas,</p>
<p>The dānava lords, the mātṛs, {50.5}</p>
<p>The grahas, the mukhyas, and so forth—</p>
<p>All of the hosts of divine beings trembled.</p>
<p>Human beings also trembled, their minds disturbed,</p>
<p>And so did the evil-minded pūtanas.{50.6}</p>
<p>After that the violently predisposed human kings,</p>
<p>Fearful and distressed,</p>
<p>Took refuge in the instructions</p>
<p>Of the Dharma king.{50.7}</p>
<p>Awed by the great radiance of Vajrapāṇi,</p>
<p>The lord of guhyakas, himself a yakṣa,</p>
<p>And by the youthful prince Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Lord of the mantra,</p>
<p>They forged then, in Mañjughoṣa’s presence,</p>
<p>A samaya connection by saying, {50.8}</p>
<p>“Protect us, O venerable boy</p>
<p>Who cares for all beings!</p>
<p>We are being burnt</p>
<p>By the extremely fierce, cruel mantras.</p>
<p>We stand before you on earth</p>
<p>In a stupor caused by our anger.” {50.9}</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva with the form of a child</p>
<p>Of great splendor addressed them as follows:</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, all of you gods,</p>
<p>Yakṣas, rākṣasas, and dānavas. {50.10}</p>
<p>“Your samaya, now explained to you by me,</p>
<p>Cannot be violated by any deity</p>
<p>By any human or nonhuman being,</p>
<p>And especially not by any spirit.{50.11}</p>
<p>“Being perpetually of a kind mental disposition,</p>
<p>At all times one should recollect the mantra—</p>
<p>The mantra that is the fully realized buddha,</p>
<p>Supreme among two-legged beings, the Lion of the Śākyas and best of men. {50.12}</p>
<p>“He taught the mantras</p>
<p>Of the uṣṇīṣas and so forth, including the Locanā;</p>
<p>The mantras of the teachers of the three worlds—</p>
<p>Cakravartin, Tejorāśi, and Jayoṣṇīṣa— {50.13}</p>
<p>“And also of Vijayoṣṇīṣa and the rest;</p>
<p>Of Padmapāṇi, Lokita,</p>
<p>Avalokiteśvara, Bhṛkuṭī,</p>
<p>Tārā, and Yaśasvinī; {50.14}</p>
<p>“And also [the mantras of] the goddesses</p>
<p>Sitavāsinī, Mahāśvetā, and Yaśovatī;</p>
<p>The vidyā Bhogavatī;</p>
<p>And Hayagrīva, the king of mantras. {50.15}</p>
<p>“These are the main mantras</p>
<p>In the Lotus family that emerged from the victorious ones.</p>
<p>The cakravartin One Syllable</p>
<p>Is the mighty lord of [all these] mantras. {50.16}</p>
<p>“If one remembers the god of gods,</p>
<p>The splendorous lord of mantras</p>
<p>By the name of Yamāntaka,</p>
<p>One will have no anger.{50.17}</p>
<p>“[The mantra of] Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Gives rise to compassionate thoughts</p>
<p>And overwhelms the mind with great compassion.</p>
<p>[The mantra of] Tārā, revealed by the former buddhas{50.18}</p>
<p>“And spoken by Avalokiteśvara,</p>
<p>Delivers sentient beings [from suffering].</p>
<p>This noble vidyā is generated during samādhi</p>
<p>And designated as woman in name and form.{50.19}</p>
<p>“Consequently, the bodhisattva conducts himself</p>
<p>As [Tārā], the supreme ‘companion in awakening,’</p>
<p>In thousands of world spheres,</p>
<p>Too many to be counted. {50.20}</p>
<p>“Synchronically, the goddess [herself] sojourns widely,</p>
<p>Bringing welfare to embodied beings</p>
<p>In her form of a woman</p>
<p>With the nature of the mantra. {50.21}</p>
<p>“At that time, she establishes beings who need guidance</p>
<p>On the path to awakening,</p>
<p>Manifesting the inconceivable</p>
<p>Conduct of the bodhisattvas. {50.22}</p>
<p>“One should also keep in mind Vajrapāṇi,</p>
<p>The valiant lord of mantras,</p>
<p>And Māmakī who upholds her family—</p>
<p>The goddess worshiped by the three worlds— {50.23}</p>
<p>“And also [the dūtīs] Śṛṅkhalā,</p>
<p>Mekhalā, Vajramuṣṭī, and Yaśasvinī;</p>
<p>[The krodhas] Krodhendra, Tilaka, and Śatru;</p>
<p>[And the vidyārājas] Nīladaṇḍa and Bhairava.{50.24}</p>
<p>“These are the hosts of dūtīs,</p>
<p>The krodhas, and those known as the overseers of vidyās.</p>
<p>They are all the main deities of the Vajra family,</p>
<p>And my sentinels.{50.25}</p>
<p>“Also, if one remembers Gajagandha,</p>
<p>The bodhisattva of great power in this world,</p>
<p>Or Mahāsthānagata, the sagacious</p>
<p>Bodhisattva of great power, {50.26}</p>
<p>“Or the greatest, the head of the sons,</p>
<p>The beautiful Samantabhadra,</p>
<p>At that time</p>
<p>One will be free from fear. {50.27}</p>
<p>“Similarly, if one continually recollects</p>
<p>Māṇibhadra, or the supreme yakṣa Jambhala,</p>
<p>Or any śrāvaka, pratyeka­buddha, or buddha,</p>
<p>How could one be afraid? {50.28}</p>
<p>“It is stated that through recollecting</p>
<p>Or worshiping them one obtains great protection.</p>
<p>Great rewards will then be obtained,</p>
<p>[Such as rebirth as] a god of Puṇyābha or Asaṃjñaka. {50.29}</p>
<p>“As for those who possess the female form,</p>
<p>They should worship the majestic goddess free from passion,</p>
<p>And also the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>While trusting in the teachings of the Victorious One.{50.30}</p>
<p>“They will not be in any danger then</p>
<p>From either friend or foe.</p>
<p>The relevant samaya, it is said,</p>
<p>Must never be violated by any mantra practitioner.{50.31}</p>
<p>“It is taught in connection with the supreme krodha</p>
<p>And praised [as the samaya] of Yamāntaka himself.</p>
<p>If beings keep this samaya,</p>
<p>No humans will be eaten.”{50.32}</p>
<p>After that, all the gods and</p>
<p>Nonhuman beings were delighted.</p>
<p>Realizing the bodhisattva mind,</p>
<p>They were all established in the samaya. {50.33}</p>
<p>The yakṣa general was angry</p>
<p>And expressed his contempt.</p>
<p>Then, shaking all the innumerable</p>
<p>World spheres, [he exclaimed,] {50.34}</p>
<p>“What is the use of this instruction?</p>
<p>There is no need for Lord of Wrath;</p>
<p>Up to now the sons of the victorious ones</p>
<p>Guided sentient beings! {50.35}</p>
<p>“The power of Lord of Wrath</p>
<p>Was dispensed with long ago!”</p>
<p>Having said this, the vajra holder</p>
<p>Threw his vajra scepter down and waited. {50.36}</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa, the divine youth</p>
<p>In the form of a male child,</p>
<p>Powerful and intelligent,</p>
<p>Laughed and gave this reply: {50.37}</p>
<p>“Do not be upset, O great yakṣa,</p>
<p>Powerful Vajrapāṇi!</p>
<p>Although the [deity] taught by me</p>
<p>Is Lord of Wrath of great power, {50.38}</p>
<p>“It is your own mantra that I am going to reveal.</p>
<p>You may disseminate it as you like,</p>
<p>[But] it is not possible for you to proclaim</p>
<p>The power of [Lord of] Wrath.{50.39}</p>
<p>“If you ask why, it is because</p>
<p>He is identical with you</p>
<p>And is seen present here in [your own] body,</p>
<p>Summoned there for you as your heart essence.{50.40}</p>
<p>“With Lord of Wrath immerged in you,</p>
<p>It is not possible to reverse it at this stage.</p>
<p>Once you have departed, permitted to do so,</p>
<p>You may teach your own samaya the way you like.{50.41}</p>
<p>“If one is unwashed, sleepy,</p>
<p>Engaged in the dharma of commoners,</p>
<p>Anointed with oil and not protected,</p>
<p>And always having bad thoughts; {50.42}</p>
<p>“If one has given up all the excellent mantras,</p>
<p>Has no faith in the teachings,</p>
<p>And consequently harbors doubts,</p>
<p>Is intolerant toward those without faith,{50.43}</p>
<p>“Rejects the jewel of the sacred Dharma,</p>
<p>Repudiates the saṅgha, and is distracted,</p>
<p>Naked, always unclean</p>
<p>And limited to unclean pursuits, {50.44}</p>
<p>“Not discreet, not practicing the mantra,</p>
<p>Always impure, and devoid of compassion;</p>
<p>If one has a penchant for having sex</p>
<p>In the vicinity of temples and caityas {50.45}</p>
<p>“Or in the courtyard of a monastery,</p>
<p>[Lord of] Wrath will destroy one.</p>
<p>Those who have broken their samaya, have no faith,</p>
<p>Do not know how to use the mantras,{50.46}</p>
<p>“Or stumble in their conduct somewhat—</p>
<p>[Lord of] Wrath will bring their ruin.</p>
<p>It is not possible to find in this human world</p>
<p>Anyone that is not careless. {50.47}</p>
<p>“Women intoxicated with passion,</p>
<p>Tarnished by breaking their samayas,</p>
<p>Are killed by Lord of Wrath,</p>
<p>Along with the negligent practitioners of mantra.{50.48}</p>
<p>“All immature beings everywhere</p>
<p>Fall under the sway of others if they are careless.</p>
<p>Except for the pratyeka­buddhas, the arhats, and the śrāvakas</p>
<p>Who have extinguished their passions forever, {50.49}</p>
<p>“All of them will be killed by Lord of Wrath</p>
<p>And punished in every respect.”</p>
<p>Being thus told by Mañjuśrī, with his mind filled with compassion,</p>
<p>The beings [in the assembly exclaimed,] {50.50}</p>
<p>“Inconceivable are the acts of the buddhas</p>
<p>And the bodhisattvas of great power!”</p>
<p>Having said this,</p>
<p>They all remained silent. {50.51}</p>
<p>The glorious Vajradhara then</p>
<p>Took up his vajra scepter once again.</p>
<p>Holding it, he rejoiced.</p>
<p>Permitted [to do so], he spoke again.{50.52}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter describing Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, the greatness of his mantra and the attendant rules, fiftieth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 51</p>
<p>At that time Vajrapāṇi, the lord of guhyakas, looked at the entire great assembly and addressed all the hosts of beings seated [in the space] above the realm of the Pure Abode: {51.1}</p>
<p>“Listen, honorable friends! For a start I will teach the painting procedure of Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka—one of infinite power and courage, the tamer of those difficult to tame, one who terminates the life of Vaivasvata, a great bodhisattva devoted to restraining wicked beings—the procedure that was taught by Mañjuśrī.{51.2}</p>
<p>“There are no restrictions regarding</p>
<p>The lunar day, the asterism, or fasting injunctions.</p>
<p>One should commission this painting</p>
<p>Whenever one is afraid of enemies. {51.3}</p>
<p>“One should obtain, on the fourteenth</p>
<p>Or the eighth day of the dark fortnight,</p>
<p>At night, in a charnel ground,</p>
<p>A clothing item from a dead brahmin.{51.4}</p>
<p>“One should take it at night,</p>
<p>Dye it red with blood,</p>
<p>Wash it in water again and again,</p>
<p>And then dry it thoroughly. {51.5}</p>
<p>“One should commission a cruel and angry painter</p>
<p>To paint in a manner that is terrifying,</p>
<p>In a charnel ground, during the dark fortnight,</p>
<p>And have it completed within three nights.{51.6}</p>
<p>“On the night of the eighth or the fourteenth lunar day,</p>
<p>By the light of a lamp fed by human fat,</p>
<p>The painter should stay put right there,</p>
<p>Always facing the south. {51.7}</p>
<p>“He should be sitting on a human skull,</p>
<p>Have the protection ritual performed, and be focused.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the mantra practitioner can do the painting himself,</p>
<p>If he is tormented by the fear and suffering caused by enemies. {51.8}</p>
<p>“In the course of the first night,</p>
<p>The enemies will be seized with great fear.</p>
<p>On the second night, they will be, in addition,</p>
<p>Seized by a great fever and fall into a swoon. {51.9}</p>
<p>“On the third night, they will breathe their last</p>
<p>And proceed to the next world.</p>
<p>How could they ever experience peace</p>
<p>When the mantra practitioner is displeased? {51.10}</p>
<p>“The enemies’ bodies will wither</p>
<p>And their houses fall into ruin</p>
<p>As the result of drawing a picture</p>
<p>Of the terrifying Yamāntaka in this way: {51.11}</p>
<p>“He should be drawn with six faces and six feet,</p>
<p>Black in color, with a ‘wolf’s belly,’</p>
<p>Wearing a garland of skulls, angry,</p>
<p>Wearing a tiger skin, {51.12}</p>
<p>“Terrifying with his various weapons,</p>
<p>With a staff in his hand, inspiring fear,</p>
<p>With eyes red with rage,</p>
<p>And distinguished by his three eyes. {51.13}</p>
<p>“His blazing hair flows upward,</p>
<p>With smoke-colored strands here and there.</p>
<p>He is black as collyrium, terrifying,</p>
<p>And dark as a monsoon cloud. {51.14}</p>
<p>“One should draw him mounted on a buffalo</p>
<p>And resembling, in form, the god of death,</p>
<p>Vicious in his actions, extremely terrifying,</p>
<p>And a fierce and vehement killer. {51.15}</p>
<p>“He terminates the life of Yama</p>
<p>And is ready to kill living beings.</p>
<p>Exceedingly cruel in his actions,</p>
<p>He is most terrible and terrifying. {51.16}</p>
<p>“This bringer of death to all embodied beings</p>
<p>Strikes fear and panic into fear itself.</p>
<p>One should draw the supremely wrathful one</p>
<p>Using paints made from one’s own blood. {51.17}</p>
<p>“The paints should be of bright and varied [colors],</p>
<p>Mixed with human fat and cow products.</p>
<p>They should be in containers made of skulls,</p>
<p>Secured with [pieces of] human bone.{51.18}</p>
<p>“One should use brushes</p>
<p>Skillfully made from the hair of a corpse.</p>
<p>Whether the painting is done by oneself or a painter,</p>
<p>It must be executed while fasting. {51.19}</p>
<p>“One should [thus] make the best of paintings,</p>
<p>Offering worship at the beginning, halfway through, and at the end [of the work],</p>
<p>[Which should consists of] copious bali offerings of flowers and so forth,</p>
<p>Red chaplets, and prime quality sandalwood.</p>
<p>One should burn incense of human flesh and fat</p>
<p>And adorn [the working place] with lamps [fed] with [human] fat. {51.20}</p>
<p>“When the painting is finished,</p>
<p>One should pay the artist—</p>
<p>Always a big amount,</p>
<p>Or whatever he will be happy with.</p>
<p>Since his Dharma work is fraught with great danger,</p>
<p>It should be made worthwhile for him.{51.21}</p>
<p>“In short,  one should pay a generous amount,</p>
<p>Whatever the craftsman may desire.</p>
<p>As the artist’s work will produce results,</p>
<p>One should avoid underpayment. {51.22}</p>
<p>“He should be employed on terms</p>
<p>That he finds wholly satisfactory.</p>
<p>A protection ritual must also be performed,</p>
<p>Otherwise he will die. {51.23}</p>
<p>“[As] the artisan would perish with his household,</p>
<p>He too must protect himself.</p>
<p>He must do the work after reciting the vidyā,</p>
<p>And the procedure should not be disclosed to others. {51.24}</p>
<p>“Once the painting is fully completed</p>
<p>And one sees that it is as had been envisaged,</p>
<p>One can perform all the cruel rites</p>
<p>That destroy one’s enemies. {51.25}</p>
<p>“Taking this best of paintings,</p>
<p>One should go to a place of one’s liking.</p>
<p>[One can target with the ritual] kings backed by powerful vassals,</p>
<p>Or those who are arrogant on account of their great wealth, {51.26}</p>
<p>“Proud in the extreme,</p>
<p>Cruel and given to cruel pursuits,</p>
<p>Or committing offenses against the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>Also, the nihilists who reject the mantras,</p>
<p>Those who do not worship the mantra [deities],</p>
<p>Or those who censure the devotees who take refuge in these [deities]. {51.27}</p>
<p>“Particularly humiliated will be those</p>
<p>Who insult mantra reciters.</p>
<p>One can target them,</p>
<p>Following the prescribed procedure. {51.28}</p>
<p>“The rite that instantly arrests the life force</p>
<p>Can likewise be employed</p>
<p>Against those who always act contrarily to the Dharma</p>
<p>And oppress each and every living creature. {51.29}</p>
<p>“One should obtain the fruit,</p>
<p>Leaves, bark, and root of soapberry</p>
<p>And combine them with kāñjika, tamarind,</p>
<p>And powdered human bone. {51.30}</p>
<p>“[One should add] white mustard oil, some poison,</p>
<p>Vinegar, fresh ginger, and brown mustard</p>
<p>And blend [everything] with blood</p>
<p>Of human origin. {51.31}</p>
<p>“One should take this entire preparation,</p>
<p>Set up the painting in a secluded place,</p>
<p>And position oneself to face south,</p>
<p>With the painting facing north. {51.32}</p>
<p>“One should prepare the fire pit as one likes</p>
<p>And make it blaze using bundles of straw</p>
<p>And dry sticks that produce acrid [smoke].</p>
<p>Fully focused, one should offer</p>
<p>The entire preparation into the fire pit</p>
<p>Following the procedure prescribed for homa.{51.33}</p>
<p>“One should summon the [god of] fire</p>
<p>With the mantra of Lord of Wrath.</p>
<p>For all the rites of this ritual,</p>
<p>One should display the spear mudrā. {51.34}</p>
<p>“One should angrily offer into the fire pit</p>
<p>One thousand and eight oblations.</p>
<p>At the first junction [of the night],</p>
<p>The [target’s] son will die;{51.35}</p>
<p>“At the second junction, the [target’s] wife</p>
<p>Along with his retinue and the senior staff;</p>
<p>And at the third, the person</p>
<p>Against whom the rite was performed. {51.36}</p>
<p>“If one recites at midnight,</p>
<p>Close to the painting,</p>
<p>With the intention to kill one’s enemies,</p>
<p>This will happen just so. {51.37}</p>
<p>“The [target’s] kingdom will be ruined—</p>
<p>A plague will arise in his army,</p>
<p>And there will be wildfires, hurricanes,</p>
<p>Heavy rains, and floods. {51.38}</p>
<p>“The [target’s] entire army will be</p>
<p>Completely destroyed by another army.</p>
<p>Various misfortunes will befall him,</p>
<p>And he will be stricken with great illness. {51.39}</p>
<p>“The entire body of that king</p>
<p>Will wither, there is no doubt about this,</p>
<p>And his whole household will be haunted</p>
<p>And troubled by nonhuman beings. {51.40}</p>
<p>“He will find no rest in bed</p>
<p>And will pace in circles on the ground.</p>
<p>His house will be overrun</p>
<p>By rākṣasas, pretas, and kravyādas. {51.41}</p>
<p>“He will always be troubled and afraid</p>
<p>And tormented by acute suffering.</p>
<p>Maheśvara and other earthly deities</p>
<p>Will not be able to protect him, {51.42}</p>
<p>“Nor will the world protectors—Brahmā and so forth;</p>
<p>Or the thirty-three gods—Śakra and so forth;</p>
<p>Or any mantras or deities</p>
<p>In the whole world. {51.43}</p>
<p>“The life of a person who is evil, cruel, and haughty</p>
<p>Will be brought to an end.</p>
<p>If the mantra is recited</p>
<p>At midnight or at midday,</p>
<p>The angry Vaivasvata will appear</p>
<p>As Yamarāja before [such a person]. {51.44}</p>
<p>“During the dark fortnight, whenever convenient,</p>
<p>One should prop up the painting on the ground</p>
<p>And perform a big pūjā along with bali offerings.</p>
<p>This should be in a charnel ground, in a forest, {51.45}</p>
<p>“By a solitary tree or a śivaliṅga,</p>
<p>On top of a mountain, or in a cave.</p>
<p>One should always perform [this rite]</p>
<p>Alone, without a companion, {51.46}</p>
<p>“While staying in a lonely place in a great forest,</p>
<p>A vacant temple or shrine,</p>
<p>At a river,</p>
<p>Or on the shore of an ocean. {51.47}</p>
<p>“One should always do the ritual</p>
<p>Staying in or near such places,</p>
<p>Or anywhere one wants within the radius</p>
<p>Of one hundred leagues [from the target]. {51.48}</p>
<p>“One should always perform these rites</p>
<p>Following the rules and staying pure.</p>
<p>There are countless locations where one may stay</p>
<p>And infinite number of pure places. {51.49}</p>
<p>“Within the inconceivable domain of mantras,</p>
<p>The range of mantra [activity] is inconceivable.</p>
<p>The power of mantras is inconceivable,</p>
<p>The accomplishment of reciters is inconceivable,</p>
<p>The activity appears to be inconceivable,</p>
<p>And the result is also inconceivable. {51.50}</p>
<p>“Inconceivable is the activity</p>
<p>Of Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, the great being.</p>
<p>Inconceivable, too, is the range of his power</p>
<p>And his great display of miracles.</p>
<p>Inconceivable is the accomplishment of reciters</p>
<p>Of his mantra observed here on earth. {51.51}</p>
<p>“All the bodhisattvas, with their great powers,</p>
<p>Would not be able to protect the target;</p>
<p>How then would worldly mantra deities,</p>
<p>Along with the grahas and mātṛs, protect him? {51.52}</p>
<p>“Neither Īśāna nor Viṣṇu;</p>
<p>Nor Skanda or Purandara;</p>
<p>Nor those who are bound by samaya,</p>
<p>Including the victorious ones and their sons; {51.53}</p>
<p>“Nor the eminent bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who abide on the ten levels;</p>
<p>Nor the pratyeka­buddhas and arhats,</p>
<p>Free from passion and possessed of great powers</p>
<p>Would be able to protect [the target],</p>
<p>Even though they formerly took the samaya. {51.54}</p>
<p>“I will briefly explain.</p>
<p>Listen, those of you who desire prosperity!</p>
<p>When the reciter is not pleased,</p>
<p>No being can escape him;</p>
<p>How could such a being find peace,</p>
<p>If the reciter of this supreme mantra is not happy? {51.55}</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, the reciter</p>
<p>Of the great Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka</p>
<p>Is kindly disposed in his mind</p>
<p>Or tender with compassion,</p>
<p>Then such being will obtain peace and stability</p>
<p>And will remain alive. {51.56}</p>
<p>“[One should combine] neem,</p>
<p>White mustard, kāñjika, the five poisons,</p>
<p>Human blood, flesh,</p>
<p>Salt, the three pungent substances,{51.57}</p>
<p>“Brown mustard, powdered conch,</p>
<p>Vinegar, fresh ginger,</p>
<p>The root of devil’s trumpet,</p>
<p>The root of ribbed gourd,{51.58}</p>
<p>“The root of the castor-oil plant, barley potash,</p>
<p>Safflower, devil’s thorn,</p>

<p>Garlic, gṛñjanaka,{51.59}</p>
<p>“Dhak tree, śākhoṭaka tree,</p>
<p>Onion, and grain beer.</p>
<p>Having blended all these [ingredients], one should offer</p>
<p>[The mixture] into the fire, near to the painting. {51.60}</p>
<p>“When one has offered one thousand and eight homas,</p>
<p>The enemies will be destroyed, root and branch—</p>
<p>One will destroy all of them</p>
<p>Along with their sons, daughters, and retinues. {51.61}</p>
<p>“If one performs the homa at the second junction,</p>
<p>They will be completely uprooted.</p>
<p>If the reciter performs the homa</p>
<p>When the third junction has arrived, {51.62}</p>
<p>“A famine will strike the target</p>
<p>And his townsfolk.</p>
<p>There will be droughts and many deaths,</p>
<p>With rākṣasas pullulating everywhere. {51.63}</p>
<p>“There will be wildfires, hailstorms,</p>
<p>Thunder, and lightning</p>
<p>In the countries and domains</p>
<p>Of such a king. {51.64}</p>
<p>“Many disasters will occur,</p>
<p>Including an invasion by a foreign army.</p>
<p>There will be many misfortunes</p>
<p>In his country—</p>
<p>They will manifest in various ways,</p>
<p>As the goddess of fortune departs.{51.65}</p>
<p>“If one offers as homa the root of devil’s trumpet,</p>
<p>The target will lose his mind.</p>
<p>If one offers kaṭuka as homa,</p>
<p>The target will definitely be caught in a great fire.</p>
<p>If one offers a citron into the fire,</p>
<p>A great fever with chills will arise in the [target’s] body. {51.66}</p>
<p>“Whether he is a wicked king</p>
<p>Intoxicated by his own might,</p>
<p>Backed by powerful and cruel vassals</p>
<p>And his own great army,</p>
<p>He will die after two</p>
<p>Or seven nights. {51.67}</p>
<p>“Whichever [king is targeted], one should write</p>
<p>The name of his personal deity or his nakṣatra</p>
<p>And draw his form on the ground in front of the painting</p>
<p>Using charcoal from a cremation ground.</p>
<p>Then, one should step upon the [king’s] head with one’s foot</p>
<p>And recite the mantra angrily. {51.68}</p>
<p>“All of a sudden the king will be seized</p>
<p>By various acute pains.</p>
<p>Overcome by a terrible disease,</p>
<p>He will die that very moment. {51.69}</p>
<p>“He also may be struck with an axe</p>
<p>And, moreover, lose his limbs.</p>
<p>He may be eaten by nonhuman beings</p>
<p>Such as the cruel rākṣasas, kaśmalas, {51.70}</p>
<p>“Kravyādas, pūtanas,</p>
<p>Piśācas, pretas, or mātṛs.</p>
<p>He may suddenly be attacked by them,</p>
<p>And even by his own servants.” {51.71}</p>
<p>The glorious Vajradhara,</p>
<p>Having thus spoken to the assembly,</p>
<p>Bowed to all the buddhas</p>
<p>And then waited in silence. {51.72}</p>
<p>For the sake of those who want to benefit the world,</p>
<p>He furthermore pronounced</p>
<p>The mantra of all the hosts of yakṣas</p>
<p>And yakṣiṇīs everywhere.{51.73}</p>
<p>Continuing with his talk,</p>
<p>The bodhisattva, the general of the yakṣas,</p>
<p>Then taught the section on the yakṣiṇīs</p>
<p>That contains all the [relevant] rites:</p>
<p>The summoning of anyone, the enthrallment,</p>
<p>And the removing of all physical afflictions.{51.74}</p>
<p>When a mantra practitioner is looking for sex</p>
<p>And is blinded by passion or otherwise confused in his mind,</p>
<p>The Sugata’s prohibitive ordinances</p>
<p>Cannot possibly stop him.{51.75}</p>
<p>Such people have already experienced intense suffering</p>
<p>In the cycle of births without beginning.</p>
<p>The tathāgatas taught that their [future] rebirth</p>
<p>Will take them from suffering to greater suffering.{51.76}</p>
<p>A celibate person who has tamed his senses</p>
<p>Will obtain a pleasant rebirth,</p>
<p>Which is said to be good and auspicious.</p>
<p>Eventually, he will obtain peace.</p>
<p>Riding the three vehicles with equanimity,</p>
<p>He will obtain nirvāṇa. {51.77}</p>
<p>Those among the ascetics who, blinded by passion,</p>
<p>Do the opposite under the sway of bad inclinations,</p>
<p>Will wander in the terrible abyss of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>Following the five destinies. {51.78}</p>
<p>It is for the sake of those who suffer [like this]</p>
<p>That the sensual enjoyments will be described.</p>
<p>They will then have all their negativity extinguished,</p>
<p>Will turn away from the three faults, and,</p>
<p>Following the injunctions of the Teacher,</p>
<p>Will be released from all fetters.{51.79}</p>
<p>This concludes  the detailed second chapter with the precepts regarding the violent rites of Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, fifty-first in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>Chapter 52</p>
<p>At that time the great being, Bodhisattva Śāntamati, who was sitting in the midst of that great gathering, got up from his seat, bowed to each of the buddhas, and stood in the middle of the assembly. Having circumambulated the blessed Śākyamuni three times clockwise, he bowed at his feet and, looking in the direction of Vajrapāṇi, the great general of the yakṣa army, said: {52.1}</p>
<p>“You are exceedingly cruel, Vajrapāṇi, in that you teach mantra methods that are harmful to all sentient beings, or serve to obtain sensual pleasures. It is not proper, O son of the victorious ones, for the bodhisattvas, the great beings, to act like this because bodhisattvas, great beings, are endowed with great compassion and practice bodhisattva conduct. Practicing benevolence for the sake of all beings, they do not cast off the fetters of existence.{52.2}</p>
<p>“Moreover, O son of the victorious ones, the venerable tathāgatas, the fully realized buddhas, having all sentient beings in mind, do not give Dharma instructions on how to harm beings. Since they possess great compassion, they adopt the attitude of benevolence toward all beings.” {52.3}</p>
<p>The great being Bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi replied to Bodhisattva Śāntamati, “Śāntamati! A bodhisattva should indeed train to be this way and should adopt such an attitude. What you now say and teach, all the buddhas and the bodhisattvas of great power teach. I will explain it, too, speaking from the perspective of the absolute truth. {52.4}</p>
<p>“The ultimate Dharma is taught</p>
<p>While abiding in the ultimate reality.</p>
<p>The limit of beings cannot be conceived of,</p>
<p>Nor can the methods for ripening them. {52.5}</p>
<p>“The teachings of the buddhas are inconceivable,</p>
<p>And so is the conduct of awakening.</p>
<p>When it comes to beings who require guidance,</p>
<p>A bodhisattva’s mode of acting is inconceivable. {52.6}</p>
<p>“The conduct of the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Is proclaimed as inconceivable.</p>
<p>Among all of the mantras,</p>
<p>The power of this mantra-method is inconceivable.{52.7}</p>
<p>“The extent of the miraculous power of the mantra</p>
<p>Of Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, the great being,</p>
<p>Is inconceivable, and so is the greatness</p>
<p>Of mastering it. {52.8}</p>
<p>“Śāntamati, the conduct of the bodhisattvas, the great beings, which manifests throughout the entire domain of sentient beings, is inconceivable. Accordingly, Śāntamati, a bodhisattva who recites the mantra should think, ‘Supposing the aims of the target [were fulfilled], he would accumulate a lot of negativity and would fall into one of the great hells. But this being should not make his store of negativity even greater. May he never be separated from the three realizations.’{52.9}</p>
<p>“Only after forming this wish, Śāntamati, can a bodhisattva who recites the mantra perform a violent rite of assault, applying the skillful means. In all [such] rites, he must be aware of his motive and avoid any unwholesome motives. When undertaking to guide beings, he must strive to do this with a mind full of compassion. {52.10}</p>
<p>“Moreover, son of the victors, because of the greatness of their comprehension of Dharma and non-Dharma, virtue and nonvirtue, and good and bad, the blessed buddhas mastered the ability to skillfully guide beings. They have attained the realization of the sphere of phenomena,  and all of them without exception bring beings to maturity by the skillful means of Dharma instructions.{52.11}</p>
<p>“We should strive, son of the victors, to be the same [as them], so that we can guide, mature, and instruct beings. Therefore, venerable sons of the victors, each and all of you present in this assembly, who have taken the great samaya, should study and develop trust, seeking to establish what is skillful and what is not, so that you can take joy in teaching the Dharma of the tathāgatas.”{52.12}</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Śāntamati, the great being, looked at the yakṣa general Vajrapāṇi in silence and remained in his seat. Looking then at Lord Buddha, he thought, “The Buddha’s teachings are inconceivable.” {52.13}</p>
<p>Vajrapāṇi, the master of guhyakas, directing his gaze at the entire assembly, continued to teach the ritual of Lord of Wrath: “Listen, respectable hosts of gods and all the hordes of bhūtas who dwell in the inhabited worlds! {52.14}</p>
<p>“To start, one should perform the protection ritual, take the painting of Lord of Wrath, and go to a secluded place where there is a single śivaliṅga, the abode of Maheśvara. One should anoint this liṅga with poison, blood, brown mustard oil, and kāñjika, and worship it with the petals of neem tree [flowers]. One should put on a sacred thread made of human entrails of tubular shape, take a human skull with the right hand, and make a gesture as if delivering a blow. Filled with utmost wrath, one should threaten the liṅga with the index finger of the left hand, while focusing the mind on humiliating the haughty and wicked kings or other corrupt men with powerful acquaintances, very wealthy, very fierce, and very influential. One should then shut the door [of the temple] and stand naked with loose hair, with one’s left foot atop the Maheśvara liṅga. One should recite the mantra of Lord [of Wrath] until the liṅga splits open. {52.15}</p>
<p>“The liṅga will be in two separate parts and the great syllable hūṁ will be heard. One must not be afraid at that time. On the very same day, the wicked kings, or other enemies with powerful acquaintances, will suddenly be seized with fever, or seized by nonhuman beings, such as rākṣasas and so forth. If, at that time, one keeps reciting the mantra for a while, the enemy’s life will suddenly be terminated. If one recites at night, the enemy’s entire family will perish. {52.16}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. One should go at midday, as before, to a temple of Maheśvara and worship the liṅga with neem leaves, burn the incense of human flesh, and recite the mantra until the house of the enemy is set on fire, or the enemy starts shivering from a great fever. If one does not stop reciting and remains, really angry, near to Dakṣiṇamūrti, the enemy will die and his family line will be terminated. To bring [the enemy] back to life, one should repeatedly wash the liṅga in water and rinse it with the cool milk of a cow. [The enemy] will become well again. {52.17}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. One should light a fire opposite the southern face of the Maheśvara liṅga, using sticks of the thorn apple, and offer into it one thousand and eight oblations of sticks of vaikaṅkata smeared with poison, blood, and brown mustard [oil]. All the enemies will succumb to a serious illness and will be unable to perform any actions. On the second day, they will be seized with a great fever, a sharp pain, and various diseases. They may also become seized by nonhuman beings who will eventually bring about their death. On the third day, [if the rite is performed] at the three junctions, all of them will, without exception, lose their lives. To bring them back to life, one should offer oblations of milk. This will pacify the suffering.  All the people in the area and all the enemies will become well again. {52.18}</p>
<p>“Similarly, one can perform this rite for any target by stepping upon the deity or spirit that the target is a devotee of. This deity should be represented by its mantra or nakṣatra, upon which one should step with one’s left foot and perform the rite. The exceptions are the vidyās who are tathāgatas, over whom one should never step or stand astride but perform the rite, for all of them, holding them between one’s big toes. It is only the worldly mantra deities that one can step upon. {52.19}</p>
<p>“Even if the mantra of Lord of Wrath has not been fully mastered, it can still accomplish the [intended] activities by merely being recited. With it, one can obliterate all [other] mantras, slay all one’s enemies, and destroy all the magical diagrams and devices. In short, whatever this mantra is employed to do, it will accomplish all of it regardless of whether it is a mundane or supramundane mantra ritual. The mantra will accomplish it all. Through merely reciting it, all hopes will be fulfilled. Accomplished through recitation, Lord of Wrath will subsequently grant the supreme accomplishment. The practitioner will destroy his enemies by merely wishing to do so. If employed in combination with the great spear mudrā, the mantra will accomplish all activities. {52.20}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. One should go at midday to a charnel ground, fast for one night—the fourteenth of the dark fortnight—at a cremation spot, light a fire there using charnel ground wood, and offer into the fire oblations of brown mustard smeared with poison and blood. Subsequently, all the pretas will arrive, making the sound hā hā. One must not be afraid, but say, ‘Please kill my enemies!’ They will reply, ‘So be it!’ and disappear. Then, traveling one thousand leagues in a mere instant, they will kill the enemies and ruin their families. They will carry out these and similar acts. {52.21}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. In a secluded and clean area, wearing clean clothes,  one should enter an abandoned house and offer one thousand and eight oblations of cotton seeds. One should then scoop the [sacrificial] ashes with both hands, wrap them in clean cloth in two separate bundles, and seal them in a double clay bowl. Ritually protected, one should then take the [sealed] contents out of the house and go at night—either the fourteenth or the eighth of the dark fortnight—to a big charnel ground. Standing at a cremation spot with one’s face toward the south, naked and with loose hair, one should hold the sealed vessel and recite the mantra, angry and fearless, ten thousand times. The ashes will thus become empowered. {52.22}</p>
<p>“Should any nonhuman being then request a power substance, one should not give it, but apply force, recollecting Lord of Wrath and employing his syllable hūṁ. [The spirit] will die that very instant. This method is in particular for all the vighnas. One should make an ash mark with the ashes held in the left or the right hand.{52.23}</p>
<p>“Having performed the protection [rite] with care, one should return [to the abandoned house] before dawn. At sunrise, one should wash oneself and, when clean, put on clean clothes and go to one’s own house or a place of one’s choice. {52.24}</p>
<p>“Then, if one takes the ashes with one’s right hand and throws them at the head of any male being, whether two-legged or four-legged—a man, a god, a nāga, or a yakṣa—he will become enthralled. If one takes the ashes with one’s left hand and throws them at the head of any female being, whether human or nonhuman, she will become enthralled. {52.25}</p>
<p>“If one takes the ashes with one’s right hand and strikes with them a man around the navel, he will become a eunuch. Or, if one sprinkles the ashes onto his private parts, he will not be able to have sex. {52.26}</p>
<p>“If one sprinkles some ash onto the private part of the woman that one is fond of, she will not be able to have sex with another man.  She will be free from lesions, but whenever she returns to the other man again, the lesions will clearly manifest. She will thus be unable to indulge in her inappropriate passion. {52.27}</p>
<p>“Likewise, if one sprinkles the ash onto a man’s penis with one’s right hand, he will be not be able to have sex when frequenting the wives of others. His penis will be as if completely withered. The erection, however, will return when he submits to the will of whoever administered the ashes. Whoever administers the ashes, whether it is a woman to a man or the other way around, the recipient will come under his or her power. According to their wish, the recipient will either remain or not remain under their control. {52.28}</p>
<p>“If the ashes are administered to men who rape their partner, their private parts will become infested with worms, eaten by which they will lose their lives. Within one month their bodies will fester, smelling foul and looking like corpses. They will contract male diseases, such as the ‘great discharge’ and so forth. They will develop cancer, and when they do, the torment of it will kill them. Or, if this is the wish of the person who administers the ashes, they will just be unable to enjoy anything. One can make all this happen with a mere touch, if one wants to.{52.29}</p>
<p>“If one cannot physically touch the target, one should stand within the range of sight, [and if this is not possible], outside the range of sight, and cast the ashes with the wind, so that some of it settles on the target. The dispenser should thus cast the ashes making a wish. Whatever acts he thinks of, he will realize all of them, whether by his own or somebody else’s hand. All of them will come to pass according to his wish, and not otherwise.{52.30}</p>
<p>“One can also sprinkle the ashes onto beds, seats, and so on; spreads, covers, and so on; different types of adornments, different clothes, riding animals, vehicles, shoes, parasols, and so on; any types of tools;  all the things necessary for the body; cooked and uncooked food and drink; crockery and cutlery; or flowers, betel, fruit, perfume, incense, and so on. If one besprinkles any of these, the body of the enemy will become infested with and bitten by lice, fleas, and worms all over. He will be smitten by suffering of different kinds and will die within seven nights. Neither physicians nor gods will be able to stop it. No mantras will be able to protect him and nobody will be able to help, except for the one who administered the ashes. {52.31}</p>
<p>“The following is the remedial procedure. One should blend together licorice root, blue lotus, and white sandalwood. One should mash these ingredients together with cool water and smear [the paste on the target’s body], starting from the head and ending with the soles of the feet, while reciting the mantra of Noble Mañjuśrī. The target will become well again. {52.32}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite. One should employ it only against all the wicked witches, swollen with pride, and no other women. Having gone upwind from the woman intended as the target, one should cast the ashes toward her with the wind. If one does the corresponding visualization, her vagina and breasts will completely disappear. If the same is done to a man, he will lose his male organ and his facial and bodily hair and develop breasts. In this way, one may perform, or have someone else perform, many different and unusual acts. One may engage for this purpose someone whom one likes, either a woman or a man. {52.33}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, one may pass on the ashes to and engage in the desired [task] an accomplice that one does not like. If one duly instructs him in the procedure, the target will be seized, accordingly, by a serious illness or other disorder. Touching the head in combination with the appropriate visualization causes [the target] to develop a severe headache.  Touching the mouth will cause an inflammation of the mouth. Following in this order, the target may develop an acute chest pain or stomachache. Similarly, touching the legs and the feet will result in [the legs and feet of the target] developing blood-related diseases, when the blood goes bad. {52.34}</p>
<p>“In short, one can cause death, loss of vitality, or inflammation with suppuration. One can also summon or enthrall the target. Whatever [the ashes] are employed for, all of that will be accomplished. One can bring harm upon, summon, or enthrall the target, even if one is far away. {52.35}</p>
<p>“One should go next to a wall that is difficult to breach and, standing upwind, cast the ashes held in both hands. The wall, the main gateway, and the watchtower will crumble. The residence that will subsequently come into view will go up in flames, and the defending army will be routed. Plagued by great calamities, the target will either flee, leaving everything behind, or will give himself up as prisoner. {52.36}</p>
<p>“Similarly, if one throws the ashes with the wind at the enemy forces, even a powerful army will be defeated. It will be seized with a great febrility or fever and its elephants, horses, chariots, banners, and so forth, including the general, will be destroyed or taken prisoner. {52.37}</p>
<p>“One can thus perform many different rites as necessary, whether they are to destroy the enemy or afford protection for oneself, one’s own army, and one’s allies. To completely undo the harm ever inflicted on any target, one should offer one thousand oblations of milk in front of the painting. They will again become strong and well. {52.38}</p>
<p>“If one wants to perform magic on a yakṣiṇī—</p>
<p>Naṭī, Naṭṭā, and Bhaṭṭā;</p>
<p>One known as Revatī;</p>
<p>And Tamasundarī, Ālokā,</p>
<p>Mekhalā, and Sumekhalā—</p>
<p>These eight yakṣiṇīs</p>
<p>Can grant every desire.{52.39}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Naṭikā is:</p>
<p>“OṁNaṭī, great Naṭī! Come, come in your divine form! Svāhā!’</p>
<p>“One should draw this vidyā on a slab or a tablet and recite her mantra one thousand and eight times while living on a diet of meat or milk. She should be drawn adorned with all the ornaments, of pure dark complexion, next to a tree. She wears a single garment, has loose hair and red eyes, and is smiling a little. She displays the threatening mudrā toward the practitioner with her right hand and holds on to a branch of the tree with the left. All her limbs are adorned, and she is wearing a brightly colored, silken sash. {52.40}</p>
<p>“One should position oneself before the painting of the same Lord of Wrath, alert in mind and facing north, and light a fire of dhak sticks. One should offer into it, at the three junctions of the day for seven days, one thousand and eight bdellium pills smeared with curds, honey, and ghee. One the seventh day, one should make an extensive bali offering, lighting butter lamps and reciting the mantra until midnight. The yakṣiṇī will then arrive in person in her own form, effulgent with great light. {52.41}</p>
<p>“When she arrives, she will say, ‘What can I do for you?’ The practitioner should reply, ‘Be my wife.’ She will then say, ‘So be it!’ and will disappear. From then on, she will be the practitioner’s wife. She will grant his every wish and take him to her abode. He will obtain there an elixir of long life, and upon drinking it he will obtain a divine form, equal to the great yakṣa. If she does not arrive, the second time one should include in the recitation [the mantra of] Lord of Wrath, and she will certainly come. If not, she will wither and die.{52.42}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Naṭṭā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Naṭṭā!  Wearing white garments and garlands, and fond of sex! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her ritual procedure is the same as the previous. {52.43}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Bhaṭṭā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Bhaṭṭā, Bhaṭṭā! Splendorous one, why do you tarry? Come, come! Arrive, arrive! Do my bidding! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her rite can be accomplished even without the painting. One should draw a maṇḍala in a prominent spot and recite her mantra one thousand and eight times while burning an incense of bdellium. If one does this without engaging in talk, alone, pure, and behind closed doors, she will certainly arrive within one month, at nighttime. {52.44}</p>
<p>“When she arrives, the practitioner should make love to her, and she will become his wife who grants every wish. If he enters her house, he will live five thousand years. If not, he will stay in Jambūdvīpa and live five hundred years, playing with her. She will carry out his every command. She will go with him, wherever he wishes. She will procure for him the elixir of longevity, and, just as a beloved wife does, will act with the best of intentions. {52.45}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Revatī is, ‘Homage to all the yakṣiṇīs!’ [The mantra to recite is]:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, red one with a red glow and wearing red unguents! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Revatī is a distinguished yakṣiṇī,</p>
<p>Playful and fond of sex.</p>
<p>She wears a soft-red garment</p>
<p>And has blue, curly hair. {52.46}</p>
<p>“This yakṣa lady is adorned on every limb</p>
<p>And always delights in the pleasures of sex.</p>
<p>She always grants wishes and gives pleasure.</p>
<p>One should depict her displaying a boon-granting gesture. {52.47}</p>
<p>“Her painting should be done as before, except that Revatī is wearing garments of red silk, including an upper garment of the same material. Her complexion has a reddish glow. {52.48}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Mekhalā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Mekhalā! Great yakṣiṇī! Please do my bidding! Svāha!{52.49}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Sumekhalā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Mekhalā, Sumekhalā! Great yakṣiṇī who fulfills every purpose, hūṁ! Remember your samaya! Svāha!{52.50}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Ālokinī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Lokinī! Lokavatī!Svāhā!</p>
<p>“The ritual procedure of the [last three] yakṣiṇīs is the same as before. {52.51}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Tamasundarī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ ghuṇu!Ghuṇu, ghuṇu, O secret one! Come, come, O guhyakī! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“As for her practice, no painting of her is prescribed. One should start during a full moon, wearing clean clothes and being clean oneself, in a secluded place . . . . One should firmly shut the door and recite her vidyā ten thousand times in complete and utter darkness. This constitutes the preliminary practice. {52.52}</p>
<p>“Afterward, one should begin the formal practice. One should start during a full moon and perform the rite until the next full moon, doing it alone at night in an isolated and hidden place, when it is time to sleep and one is in bed with the door closed, in complete and utter darkness. One should blend closed lotus buds and vānapuṣpa with white mustard oil and rub it onto one’s hands and feet. One should incant the right arm one hundred and eight times and go to sleep in silence. If one does this every day until the next full moon, then Tamasundarī will arrive for certain at midnight. {52.53}</p>
<p>“When she arrives, one should not engage her in conversation but make love to her in silence. If, within six months, she starts conversing, one should join in. From then on she will be an accomplished object of the practice, becoming one’s wife who grants every desire and whose soft touch gives divine pleasure. She will perform all tasks even when she is out of sight and will also procure the essential elixir of longevity. {52.54}</p>
<p>“Taking the practitioner upon her back, she will carry him even to the top of Mount Sumeru. At night, she will take him all the way around Jambūdvīpa. She will crush one’s enemies, even at a distance of one hundred leagues. Whatever she is ordered to do will turn out well, except for sexual advances on other women. This rule applies to all the yakṣiṇīs. One must not approach other women but cohabit only with them. If one goes to other women, they will cause death or insanity.{52.55}</p>
<p>“This yakṣiṇī, [also] called Andhārasundarī, is surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of yakṣiṇīs. When accomplished as an object of practice by any practitioner, she dispatches, every single day, one yakṣiṇī-servant for each of them. She has a retinue of many ministers, all of them yakṣiṇīs, among whom she is distinguished by her great miraculous power and her cover of darkness. As the ritual procedure is the same for all of them, could one see any of them? It is not possible to see her. {52.56}</p>
<p>“Among the yakṣiṇīs, famous throughout the world,</p>
<p>There is also Andhāravāsinī,</p>
<p>Endowed with great miraculous power,</p>
<p>Guhāvāsinī, Naravīrā, Yakṣakumārī,{52.57}</p>
<p>“Vadhūyakṣiṇī, Manojñā,</p>
<p>And the seventh, Surasundarī.</p>
<p>These seven yakṣiṇīs perform</p>
<p>Acts of kindness for sentient beings. {52.58}</p>
<p>“They wander around this world</p>
<p>And the entire earth.</p>
<p>Within a brief moment,</p>
<p>They can ascend to the world of the gods.{52.59}</p>
<p>“Being endowed with great miraculous powers,</p>
<p>They take part in battles between the gods and the daityas.</p>
<p>They are virtuous, compassionate, and lovingly tender</p>
<p>Toward beings for whom they are objects of desire. {52.60}</p>
<p>“They wander upon the earth,</p>
<p>Intent upon helping sentient beings.</p>
<p>Nothing is difficult for them to accomplish,</p>
<p>And they do a splendid job with every task.</p>
<p>The Bodhisattva taught [their rites]</p>
<p>To bring enjoyment to beings. {52.61}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Guhāvāsinī is:</p>
<p>“OṁGuhilā, Guhāmati, Guhāvāsinī! Please come, O blessed one, close to me! Remember your samaya! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“One should light a fire with sticks of cutch wood and offer into it, at the three junctions of the day for one month, one thousand and eight oblations of beautyberry flowers smeared with ghee. This constitutes the preliminary practice. {52.62}</p>
<p>“Afterward, one should begin the formal practice. Using uncontaminated paints, a new brush, and a new paint container, one should first draw the king of mountains, Mount Sumeru, either on a tablet, or a piece of cloth, or a wall. It has four slopes and four lofty peaks and is surrounded by a range of seven mountains. At the outer edge of these mountains, one should draw a cave that is situated in a mountainside. {52.63}</p>
<p>“In there, one should draw a single, divinely beautiful yakṣiṇī called Guhāvāsinī, adorned with all the ornaments and wearing lower and upper garments of fine silk. She has a golden complexion and a strikingly beautiful form. One should draw the painting like that and recite the vidyā [of Guhāvāsinī] ten thousand times, staying in a clean place, oneself clean and living off a diet of milk. One should offer a large pūjā, or one according to one’s means. Then, at the end of recitation, the yakṣiṇī will arrive in person, in her divinely beautiful form, effulgent with great light. {52.64}</p>
<p>“When she has arrived, one should give her a welcome offering of water mixed with white sandalwood and jasmine flowers. She will say, ‘Child, what can I do for you?’ One should say, ‘Please be my mother.’ She will reply, ‘So be it!’ and will disappear. One must not hurt her feelings and not request anything that is tainted with sensuality. She is noble and very dignified, so if one requests sensual pleasures one will not succeed. From then on, she will perform all the duties like a mother. {52.65}</p>
<p>“She will also provide food and clothes to one hundred and eight people from one’s retinue. She will protect one in difficult situations. She will carry out all her duties, even if one were staying in a deep forest or on the top of a mountain. She will provide one’s favorite food and all other things, such as the essential elixir of life and so forth. Complying with one’s wishes, whatever they are, she will magically create a monk’s hut, a family house, or another shelter. Every single day she will give one thousand pieces of gold, which must all be spent that very day. If one does not spend it all, it will be cut back. If one keeps it all, none will remain.{52.66}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite of Guhāvāsinī. One should light a fire in front of the same painting with sticks of cutch wood [and bring it to the stage where] the embers emit no flames or smoke. Using red arsenic, one should draw on the palm of one’s right hand  the image and the name of a man or, if it is a woman, on the palm of one’s left hand, and heat it over the same heap of embers while reciting the mantra. Guhāvāsinī will summon them even from the distance of one hundred leagues and will compel them to do everything that was asked. This rite should be performed at night, not during the day. {52.67}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Naravīrā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Naravīrā! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her painting should be executed exactly the same as [the painting of Guhāvāsinī], except for the cave dwelling. Instead, Naravīrā should be drawn next to an aśoka tree. The entire ritual is just like that of Guhāvāsinī, except that Naravīrā should be addressed, ‘Please be my sister!’ {52.68}</p>
<p>“There is also another rite of Naravīrā. During a lunar eclipse, one should wrap some red ocher in a piece of birch bark, put it in one’s mouth, and recite the mantra until the moon comes out of eclipse. Then, whichever woman’s name one writes with this ocher, Naravīrā will summon her even from a distance of one hundred leagues, and in the morning she will take her back to her original place. She will do everything just as a sister would. In the event of disasters, she will offer great protection. One can enthrall any woman by merely reciting the mantra. This is the rite of Naravīrā. {52.69}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Yakṣakumārī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Yakṣakumārī!Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. She should be drawn on a piece of birch bark, using bovine bezoar, as a young girl with slightly curly hair, adorned with all the ornaments, and wearing a single piece of clothing. In her right hand she is holding a fruit filled with seeds, and with the other she is holding onto a branch of an aśoka tree. {52.70}</p>
<p>“One should place this piece of birch bark above the place where one’s head is going to be and sleep alone in a hidden place. One should draw a maṇḍala with white sandalwood paste and, at the three junctions of the day, bestrew it with jasmine flowers, burn an incense of bdellium, and recite the vidyā one thousand and eight times.  One should do this for a period of one month. {52.71}</p>
<p>“Then, during the full moon, one should prepare a large pūjā with jasmine flowers and offer butter lamps and food articles. At nighttime, sitting on a bundle of kuśa grass, one should recite the mantra until Kumārī, the daughter of Vaiśravaṇa, arrives in her usual form along with a retinue of five hundred. Drawing one’s attention to the entire region [of the sky], she will remain naturally suspended in midair. She will ask, ‘What can I do for you?’ The practitioner should then request from her one of the three boons—that she either be his mother, sister, or wife. {52.72}</p>
<p>“If she becomes one’s mother, one must not hurt her feelings. If one does, ruin will follow. One must treat her like a mother, and she, the mother, will fully provide an assortment of foodstuffs, clothes, and adornments for oneself and a retinue of five hundred, if these things are merely wished for. Every day, she will give one thousand dinars. She will provide everything for as long as one is living here in Jambūdvīpa. {52.73}</p>
<p>“If she becomes one’s sister, she will summon a woman [for the practitioner], even from a distance of one hundred leagues, and then take her back to her original place. She will perform all the duties like a sister. If she becomes a wife, she will take the practitioner to her own house, where one will live for one thousand celestial years. After one dies, one will be reborn in a wealthy family. Like a wife, she will carry out every order. {52.74}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Vadhūyakṣiṇī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ niḥ.</p>
<p>“She is a wife-yakṣiṇī, and her rite is as follows. One should anoint one’s right arm with white sandalwood and the left one with saffron, and incant them with the mantra one thousand times. At nighttime, in a hidden place, alone and silent, one should firmly shut the door, throw into sesame oil five or  eight beleric myrobalan fruits, and cook them. {52.75}</p>
<p>“Discarding the myrobalan fruits, one should take the oil and put it in a new vessel made of gold, silver, copper, or clay, and place it on the bed where the feet are. One should incant the oil one thousand times with the one-syllable yakṣiṇī mantra and go to sleep in the same bed, placed in a dark, secluded place and strewn with flowers. {52.76}</p>
<p>“When the nonhuman lady arrives, she will anoint one’s feet [with the incanted oil]. Upon being touched with the palm of her lotus-like hand whose touch gives divine pleasure, one will experience, through this pleasurable touch, a divinely blissful sleep. When the sun rises at the end of the night, one will wake up with unease, and even when awake, one will keep thinking about her. However, one should not make love to her or engage her in conversation. Within six months, she will be accomplished as an object of practice. {52.77}</p>
<p>“After the six months have passed, she will arrive in her beautiful form, excited like a newly wedded wife, surrounded by a retinue of servants, with a lamp in her hand and splendid with her own radiance. She will snuggle in the bed or a seat, her colorful adornments blazing forth, and will start a conversation. She will approach holding the implements of sexual enjoyment and will embrace the practitioner around the neck. {52.78}</p>
<p>“From then on, she will follow him like a beloved wife. When she arrives, one should make love to her. She will keep one’s company through the night and disappear in the morning, leaving behind on the bed a pearl necklace worth one thousand pieces of gold. Every day, she will leave it behind and then depart. One must spend absolutely all of it. If one keeps any of it, no more will come. One must not tell anyone. If one does, one will get no more,  or else one will incur some adversity that will end in one’s death. This is because these yakṣiṇīs are exceedingly secretive and discreet, and they will not tolerate another person being told about them. {52.79}</p>
<p>“One must not tell even one’s mother, father, friend, supervisor, or relative, not even a pet or another animal, as this is most secret. This rule applies to all the guhyakas and all the yakṣiṇīs. Even if they have been accomplished as an object of practice, they will cease to be so if one divulges the secret. Also, one must never approach other women for sex, not even one’s wife. {52.80}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Manojñā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you captivate the mind! You intoxicate and drive one insane! You are stunningly beautiful and fond of sex. Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. One should build a secluded hut within a garden enclosure, below an aśoka tree. It should be well hidden and have a high wall with a paneled, bolted door. Maintaining purity, one should recite the mantra one hundred thousand times. {52.81}</p>
<p>“Afterward, one should perform the ritual. One should procure human fat, make a wick out of a textile from a charnel ground, firmly shut the door, and light a lamp. One should place a cloth that is hemmed, is brand new, and does not have any loose fibers on the outside of the door. At night, when Manojñā arrives naked, she will dress in this cloth and enter the hut, assuming the form of a female human. The practitioner will then enjoy sex with her for as long as the lamp is burning. {52.82}</p>
<p>“When the lamp burns out, Manojñā will disappear. She will leave the bed, leaving behind the cloth [that she wore] with a piece of gold tied in it. At that time one should grasp her by the hand. She will walk away, letting the rings slip off her fingers one by one. If one grasps [her] by the neck, she will relinquish her pearl necklace; if by the arm, she will let her arm bracelet slip off; if by the hips, her girdle; if by the feet, her anklets; and if by the head, her diadem. In this way, wherever one grasps her, from that place she will give a divine ornament, one after another.{52.83}</p>
<p>“Her departures and her arrivals are thus not without gain.  As before, one must spend it all each day, so that there is nothing left. When six months have passed in this way, she will start talking. One should then join the conversation and she will become one’s wife. Ever present, she will procure the elixir of longevity, drinking which one will live long. If one drives a stake of cutch wood into the ground while performing the relevant visualization, a divine palace will appear. When the stake is pulled out, it will disappear. {52.84}</p>
<p>“The second mantra of Manojñā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, O great naked one! You were born naked! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“One should light a lamp made of exactly the same components as before and incant the lamp one hundred and eight times, thus compelling [Manojñā] to act. She will certainly arrive. Alternatively, one can incant a stake and drive it into the ground. When the stake is then pulled out, or when the lamp has burnt out, she will disappear. One may also take [the accessories]—the stake; the human fat in a horn of a cow, a gaur, or a buffalo; and the wick made of a charnel-ground rag—somewhere else, where one can do the rite oneself or give [the accessories] to a person of one’s choice. However, one must not pass on the mantra. If one does, one will nullify its magical power. {52.85}</p>
<p>“Whoever one gives [this paraphernalia] to, everything will turn out for them exactly the same way. Whatever the desired outcome, whatever the hidden location where the rite is performed, the accomplishment will not be in vain. Moreover, one can have other men experience the joy of sex, but should not discuss it with them. Because of the power of the practitioner, the compliant [Manojñā] will approach a new partner to her liking, who is longing to see other women.{52.86}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Surasundarī is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Surasundarī! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. One should light a fire with sticks of cutch wood and offer into it one thousand and eight oblations of ghee at the three junctions of the day, for a period of one month. Then, during the full moon, one should sit on a bundle of kuśa grass in a clean, secluded place, and, oneself pure, recite the mantra until midnight, and she will certainly come.  Then, one should carry out everything exactly as before, choosing her as one’s mother, sister, or wife, and saying everything just as before. {52.87}</p>
<p>“By Vajrapāṇi’s command,</p>
<p>These seven yakṣiṇīs</p>
<p>Roam the entire earth,</p>
<p>As well as the triple universe with its gods and demigods. {52.88}</p>
<p>“Fond of sex with mortals,</p>
<p>They associate with those who have compassion.</p>
<p>Some yakṣiṇīs are noble,</p>
<p>While others are naive and foolish. {52.89}</p>
<p>“Yet others wander at night,</p>
<p>Assuming the form of a lion.</p>
<p>Fond of eating flesh,</p>
<p>They are eager to take the life of children.{52.90}</p>
<p>“They come to Jambūdvīpa</p>
<p>Attracted by the scent of blood.</p>
<p>Such yakṣiṇīs, ever fond of blood,</p>
<p>Take the life force away. {52.91}</p>
<p>“They visit all the unprotected houses</p>
<p>In which children have died.</p>
<p>This samaya has been taught</p>
<p>For the purpose of restraining these yakṣiṇīs.{52.92}</p>
<p>“All this has been taught</p>
<p>To benefit beings</p>
<p>By attracting, impassioning, and binding</p>
<p>Such foolish yakṣiṇīs.{52.93}</p>
<p>“If the mantra practitioner is motivated by sex,</p>
<p>Blinded by passion, and deluded in mind,</p>
<p>He may, having summoned her by the means of mantras,</p>
<p>Carnally enjoy a yakṣiṇī, a rākṣasī,</p>
<p>A nāginī, a gandharvī,</p>
<p>A daitya lady, or a kinnarī. {52.94}</p>
<p>“A mantra adept may likewise enter</p>
<p>Pleasant subterranean palaces</p>
<p>And the finest cities of the asuras,</p>
<p>With infinite numbers of women.</p>
<p>Once there, such a mantra reciter and adept</p>
<p>Will live for one eon. {52.95}</p>
<p>“When Maitreya, a fully realized buddha,</p>
<p>Becomes [the next] Buddha,</p>
<p>He will teach the sacred Dharma, upon the hearing of which</p>
<p>The mantra adept will become liberated.{52.96}</p>
<p>“Having summoned with mantras</p>
<p>A celestial girl, an asurī,</p>
<p>Or the finest vidyādhara lady,</p>
<p>He will enjoy with her the divine bliss of sex. {52.97}</p>
<p>“A mantra follower who lives in Jambūdvīpa</p>
<p>Can always summon her there.</p>
<p>Then, in a clean and hidden place,</p>
<p>He always delights in pure conduct. {52.98}</p>
<p>“The highest accomplishment</p>
<p>Will never arise for fools.</p>
<p>One should never touch a human female,</p>
<p>Who, full of piss and shit, is always a seat of impurity, {52.99}</p>
<p>“Foul-smelling and putrid.</p>
<p>She is a receptacle of suffering, destined to die,</p>
<p>And afflicted by disease and grief.</p>
<p>Sex with her will end in separation.{52.100}</p>
<p>“She is impermanent, a source of suffering,</p>
<p>Empty, vacant, void, and will not last.</p>
<p>She is the deceiver of the naive</p>
<p>And a source of false concepts. {52.101}</p>
<p>“The mantra practitioner should not indulge, out of desire,</p>
<p>In any passions that have been arising since beginningless time.</p>
<p>Emancipation attained in their midst</p>
<p>Is referred to as their cessation.{52.102}</p>
<p>“One’s mantras will succeed</p>
<p>If they are not motivated by desire.</p>
<p>One should worship those that possess ambrosia</p>
<p>And are unstained by feces, urine, and blood.{52.103}</p>
<p>“One should not touch the body of a woman</p>
<p>That is subject to old age, death, and great anguish.</p>
<p>One should not have sex with her,</p>
<p>As she is blinded by delusion and concupiscent at heart.</p>
<p>The mantra practitioner will not attain accomplishment</p>
<p>If he approaches them sexually, remaining ever impure. {52.104}</p>
<p>“On the other hand, a mantra reciter and adept</p>
<p>Who has insight, has conquered his senses,</p>
<p>And delights in pure conduct</p>
<p>Can always master any mantra.{52.105}</p>
<p>“Other yakṣiṇīs with great magical power</p>
<p>Are, invariably, Padmoccā, Pramodā,</p>
<p>Ajitā, and Jayā,</p>
<p>As well as the yakṣiṇī Śyāmāvatī. {52.106}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Padmoccā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ Padmoccā! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. One should build a hut on the banks of the Gaṅgā, in the ocean shore, or in a flower garden. The hut and oneself should be clean. Using clay, one should make a form shaped like a stone slab and firmly shut the door. One should collect all the requisites for making love and prepare a bed for the yakṣiṇī next to one’s own. One should then recite her vidyā ten thousand times. {52.107}</p>
<p>“If one continues in this manner, she will certainly arrive within one month. When she does, one should make love to her and she will become one’s wife. She will leave in the morning, leaving behind a celestial pearl necklace. And so it will be every day, until, within six months, she will remain permanently. One must not hold on to that pearl necklace. If one does, this will be the only thing one will ever get. This necklace, adorned with jewels and gems, is worth one hundred thousand dinars. {52.108}</p>
<p>“After six months have passed, Padmoccā will remain permanently as a wife who fulfills all desires. Whatever form one wants her to assume, she will attend upon one in that form. She will magically transform herself into the form that is pleasing to the practitioner, according to his wish. This procedure applies to all the yakṣiṇīs. The instructions given for the yakṣiṇīs here apply also to other yakṣiṇīs. {52.109}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Jayā is:</p>
<p>“OṁJayā, auspicious Jayā, one who is victorious! Perform all the tasks for me! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her fine body has a golden glow,</p>
<p>And her curly hair is blue.</p>
<p>This goddess is beautiful in every limb,</p>
<p>Gentle, gracious, and charming. {52.110}</p>
<p>“She is an intoxicating speaker of pleasant words</p>
<p>And a superior woman with a beautiful form, pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>Bright with her excellent features like the evening star,</p>
<p>She is worshiped by the whole world.</p>
<p>Wearing, in addition, a soft-red garment—</p>
<p>This is how Jayā is described. {52.111}</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. First, one should recite her mantra one hundred thousand times; this constitutes the preliminary service. Then, one should go to a large forest and, living on fruits, recite her mantra until Jayā arrives in person. When she does, she will ask, ‘What can I do for you?’ If she becomes one’s mother, she will, like a mother, fulfill one’s every wish. She will grant a kingdom, make one the owner of great wealth, and ensure that one lives a long life. {52.112}</p>
<p>“If she becomes one’s sister,  she will summon a woman as desired even from a distance of one thousand leagues. Every single day she will give one hundred thousand dinars. One must spend all of this. If she becomes one’s wife, she will take one to her own abode. Living in a celestial palace, one will engage in a delightful play with her for a long time. For thirty thousand years, one will do whatever one likes, equal to the great yakṣa.{52.113}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Pramodā is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ ṣṭhrīḥ hrīḥ! O great nude! Hūṁ, phaṭ, svāhā!</p>
<p>“Her practice is as follows. One should recite her mantra at midnight without counting. If one does not go back to sleep, Pramodā will certainly arrive within one month. She will become a wife who fulfills every desire. Every single day she will provide twenty-five dinars and offer sexual delights personally. In addition, she will ensure long life for the practitioner. {52.114}</p>
<p>“There are uncountable hundreds of thousands of yakṣiṇīs. So, too, there are innumerable piśācīs of great power,nāga girls, asura girls, apsarases, girls of the lower celestial (sura) orders, and daitya girls. The same is true for the vidyādharīs and all the human and nonhuman females. All of them without exception have their respective mantras, which are likewise innumerable. In the same way there are mantras of the male yakṣas, gods, nāgas, ṛṣis, gandharvas, asuras, pretas, and rākṣasas; of Mahābrahmā, Maheśvara, and Viṣṇu; and also of the mātṛs, headed by Indrāṇī, Cāmuṇḍā, and Vārāhī. All these beings have been individually summoned here on this occasion. They have been brought here by Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, seized by him, established in the samaya, and thus made subordinate to Mañjughoṣa. They stand here in the right order as his retinue and attendants. {52.115}</p>
<p>“[The rite] for each of them,  in short, is as follows. One should recite the Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka—either in a place where there is an image or having made such an image oneself—until the image shakes and then moves or starts perspiring. Then [the being portrayed in the image] will arrive in its own form and will do everything it is asked to. {52.116}</p>
<p>“In the same way, one can [practice] also the ‘four virgins.’ These great yakṣiṇīs, who have Tumburu as their brother, live, in their celestial forms, upon the ocean aboard a boat. They practice kindness to beings and are worshiped by the whole world. The same procedure may be used also for them, namely, {52.117}</p>
<p>“They should be either drawn or etched</p>
<p>On a piece of cloth, a slab of stone, or a plank,</p>
<p>Riding in a boat,</p>
<p>Where they attend to their elder brother.{52.118}</p>
<p>“These four girls travel together</p>
<p>Within the confines of the ocean.</p>
<p>One should set up their image in a hidden place</p>
<p>And begin the practice by reciting the [Lord of] Wrath. {52.119}</p>
<p>“They will start moving, shaking,</p>
<p>Or sweating all over.</p>
<p>Knowing by this that they are accomplished,</p>
<p>The mantra reciter should stop reciting. {52.120}</p>
<p>“Appearing, at the end of the night, in their usual form,</p>
<p>They will tell the practitioner what is good and what is bad for him.</p>
<p>They will accomplish</p>
<p>The reciter’s every aim.{52.121}</p>
<p>“Summoned and stunned by [Lord of] Wrath,</p>
<p>They will do everything as commanded.</p>
<p>Soma and other prominent planets,</p>
<p>The ṛṣis, the rākṣasas, {52.122}</p>
<p>“The piśācas, and the garuḍas</p>
<p>Worship these four powerful sisters.</p>
<p>Also Maheśvara and other gods like him</p>
<p>Worship these majestic ladies. {52.123}</p>
<p>“They also taught their extensive rituals</p>
<p>And their own mantra systems.</p>
<p>All of them may be employed,</p>
<p>Along with their extensive rites.</p>
<p>All these [mantra deities] remain in the thrall</p>
<p>Of Lord of Wrath, without any effort on his part. {52.124}</p>
<p>“However many mantras there are</p>
<p>That originate from impure spirits and dry up [the life of beings],</p>
<p>All of them were taught</p>
<p>And prescribed by Lord of Wrath.{52.125}</p>
<p>“The noble and distinguished mantras, on the other hand,</p>
<p>That are universally  applicable,</p>
<p>The foremost mantras, exalted and excellent,</p>
<p>Were taught by the eminent victors</p>
<p>And also by myself</p>
<p>In the capacity of the mantra holder.{52.126}</p>
<p>“Whatever other prominent mantras there are</p>
<p>That are associated with [any of] the five families—</p>
<p>Those taught by the sons of the victors</p>
<p>And also the powerful worldly mantras— {52.127}</p>
<p>“The powerful Lord of Wrath</p>
<p>Has collected all of them</p>
<p>And included them in this teaching</p>
<p>Along with the mantra methods for all of them. {52.128}</p>
<p>“Whatever procedure was designated for whatever mantra,</p>
<p>He prescribed for that mantra precisely that procedure.</p>
<p>As for the [mantra of] Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, however,</p>
<p>It is supremely suited for every activity. {52.129}</p>
<p>“The mantras of Tārā,</p>
<p>Bhṛkuṭī, and Pāṇḍaravāsinī;</p>
<p>Those of the vidyā Mahāśvetā</p>
<p>And of Māmakī of the Vajra family; {52.130}</p>
<p>“The mantras of every female uṣṇīṣa emanation—</p>
<p>In particular of the goddess Locanā—</p>
<p>And of every [other] vidyā from the Tathāgata family;</p>
<p>The mantras of the sagacious Mañjughoṣa,{52.131}</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, Samantabhadra,</p>
<p>And the lord Padmapāṇi;</p>
<p>The mantras that I have taught</p>
<p>Of the lord of the yakṣas, a very powerful bodhisattva, {52.132}</p>
<p>“And of the [other] victors’ sons</p>
<p>That are known throughout the whole world;</p>
<p>The mantras of my sagacious sons</p>
<p>Vajrasena and Suṣena— {52.133}</p>
<p>“All these mantras, which I have taught,</p>
<p>Must not be disparaged.</p>
<p>All of them must be worshiped, and, it is taught,</p>
<p>Never transgressed against. {52.134}</p>
<p>“The reciter must not employ</p>
<p>The venerable Lord of Wrath against them</p>
<p>And must never break his vidyā connection</p>
<p>With these mantra deities. {52.135}</p>
<p>“One may practice all the worldly</p>
<p>Mantra deities, according to the rite,</p>
<p>Such as Umā, Śaṅkara, Brahmā,</p>
<p>Or the venerable Hari,</p>
<p>Using the mantras as found in the respective tantras</p>
<p>And performing the rites, for each of them, accordingly. {52.136}</p>
<p>“One may do every rite</p>
<p>Of every mantra deity in every way</p>
<p>With the knowledge, however, that the action</p>
<p>Of every [such] mantra derives from [Lord of] Wrath. {52.137}</p>
<p>“The mantra Lord of Wrath,</p>
<p>Known by the name of Yamāntaka,</p>
<p>Can swiftly summon and strike</p>
<p>Even the great being Yama. {52.138}</p>
<p>“Also, the great beings such as</p>
<p>Śakra, or Vaivasvata who brings death,</p>
<p>Can be summoned and enthralled.</p>
<p>This terrible lord is the tamer of the hard to tame. {52.139}</p>
<p>“This mantra is the great mantra taught</p>
<p>By the sweet-spoken Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>It is suitable for all rites, is fierce,</p>
<p>And makes all other mantras effective.” {52.140}</p>
<p>Having said this, venerable Vajrapāṇi,</p>
<p>One of great miraculous power,</p>
<p>Bowed to the Buddha, the Lion of the Śākyas,</p>
<p>The great hero supreme among men.</p>
<p>Then the vajra holder who dwells in the circle of mantra beings</p>
<p>Taught the mantra of great magical power. {52.141}</p>
<p>“Listen, all of you sentient beings,</p>
<p>And all of you virtuous hosts of spirits,</p>
<p>And all of you overseers of the hosts of mantras!</p>
<p>I will teach this supreme mantra {52.142}</p>
<p>“That was taught by the sagacious</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>A terrible mantra that tames those difficult to tame</p>
<p>And restrains all the wicked ones.{52.143}</p>
<p>“It was taught by the bodhisattva [Mañjughoṣa]</p>
<p>In order to guide sentient beings.</p>
<p>Now I will pronounce this terrible [mantra]</p>
<p>In the midst of this assembly. {52.144}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the buddhas who arise out of the absence of the independent existence of entities! Homage to the pratyeka­buddhas and the noble śrāvakas! Homage to the bodhisattvas, the lords established on the ten levels, the great beings! This is the mantra proper: {52.145}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, kha kha! Devour, devour! O tamer of evil beings, with a sword, a club, a noose, and an axe in your hands! One with four arms, four faces, and six feet, go, go! O great destroyer of obstacles with a contorted face, inspiring fear in all nonhuman beings! You who roar with wild laughter and wear a tiger skin, perform, perform all tasks! Cut, cut all the mantras [of non-believers]! Break, break the mudrās of non-believers! Draw here, draw all nonhuman beings! Grind, grind all the wicked ones! Cause them to enter into the center of the maṇḍala! O terminator of the life of Vaivasvata, perform, perform tasks for me! Burn, burn! Cook, cook! Do not delay, do not delay! Remember your samaya pledge! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Split, split! Fulfiller of all wishes! O blessed one, why do you tarry? Please accomplish all my aims! Svāhā!{52.146} [S578]</p>
<p>“Friends, and you, all the hosts of gods! This [mantra] called Yamāntaka, Great Lord of Wrath, will summon, crush, dry up, cook, and tame even the king Yama. It will likewise summon all the mantra deities and all the gods, not to mention human beings afflicted with suffering. It will summon even the bodhisattvas established on the ten levels, let alone [the deities of] worldly mantras. {52.147}</p>
<p>“The power and strength of the Lord of Wrath is thus immeasurable. He can perform all the activities of all the mantras, whatever are taught in all the mantra systems. Once he is mastered by reciting, he will accomplish whatever he is employed to do.”</p>
<p>This completes [the section on] the lord of wrath named Yamāntaka. {52.148}</p>
<p>This concludes the fifty-second chapter, which is the detailed third chapter with the ritual prescriptions pertaining to Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings. This also concludes [the section on] the ritual of Lord of Wrath Yamāntaka. Homage to the Buddha!</p>
<p>Chapter 53</p>
<p>Blessed Śākyamuni, having now emerged from his samādhi, continued to teach the Dharma to the assembly that resembled a great ocean. There, sitting in front of all the [assembled] beings and hosts of spirits, were uncountable thousands of bodhisattvas, headed by Vajrapāṇi; uncountable thousands of arhats, headed by Śāriputra; innumerable gods devoted to the four great kings, headed by Vaiśravaṇa; innumerable gods from the realm of the Thirty-Three, headed by Śakra; as well as innumerable gods from the realms of Suyāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, Paranirmita, Vaśavartin, Brahmakāyika, Brahmapurohita, Mahābrahmā, Parīttābha, Apramāṇa, Ābhāsvara, and so forth, until Puṇyaprasava, Bṛhatphala, Avṛha, Atapas, and Akaniṣṭha. The Blessed One addressed them as follows: {53.1}</p>
<p>“Listen, venerable hosts of gods, and all of you bodhisattvas and noble śrāvakas!</p>
<p>“All conditioned things are impermanent,</p>
<p>Being characterized by arising and ceasing.</p>
<p>Having arisen, they [temporarily] cease.</p>
<p>Their definitive cessation is bliss. {53.2}</p>
<p>“They all originate from ignorance</p>
<p>And arise based on causes.</p>
<p>The aggregates are then said to arise</p>
<p>From the same cause that constitutes the root of suffering. {53.3}</p>
<p>“Knowledge is their arrester;</p>
<p>It is the cause and the producer of happiness.</p>
<p>It is said to be the destroyer of suffering;</p>
<p>In short, knowledge prevents suffering.{53.4}</p>
<p>“That is the very reason that</p>
<p>I taught a threefold vehicle.</p>
<p>Everything conditioned changes from moment to moment;</p>
<p>It is all impermanent, suffused with suffering, and lacking self-essence. {53.5}</p>
<p>“The entire prison of existence is taught</p>
<p>As being empty at all times.</p>
<p>Beings who belong to the Buddha family and have developed</p>
<p>An aversion to this prison are divided into three groups: {53.6}</p>
<p>“(1) The bodhisattvas who later become buddhas,</p>
<p>(2) Those who attain awakening on their own,</p>
<p>And further there are (3) the arhats,</p>
<p>Devoid of passion and very powerful. {53.7}</p>
<p>“The arhats attain the awakening of the śrāvakas</p>
<p>And obtain the three types of peace.</p>
<p>In short, I gave this teaching</p>
<p>To show what is virtuous and what is not. {53.8}</p>
<p>“One should always shun nonvirtue</p>
<p>And practice virtue at all times.</p>
<p>The Dharma that is taught</p>
<p>Is to never harm any sentient being. {53.9}</p>
<p>“Regarding the dharmas of the five destinies,</p>
<p>Only one constitutes the path—</p>
<p>It is the dharma that is free from karmic influences</p>
<p>And is rooted in ultimate reality. {53.10}</p>
<p>“It is the same path that was taught</p>
<p>By the primordial buddhas of the past.</p>
<p>I also taught it in full,</p>
<p>Propelling beings toward the peace of nirvāṇa. {53.11}</p>
<p>“Relying on this ultimate dharma,</p>
<p>One will attain the ultimate reality—</p>
<p>The ultimate reality that is described</p>
<p>As the absence of limits common to all the dharmas. {53.12}</p>
<p>“This dharma, in short,</p>
<p>Has been explained as twofold.</p>
<p>Listen, all you gods,</p>
<p>And you bodhisattvas with great powers! {53.13}</p>
<p>“Arhats, śrāvakas, listen to me!</p>
<p>When I attain nirvāṇa on earth,</p>
<p>It will be in the middle of the Sāla Grove</p>
<p>At the foothills of the Himalayas, {53.14}</p>
<p>“On the banks of the Hiraṇyavatī</p>
<p>That flows through the country of the Mallas.</p>
<p>There, in the middle of the Yamakasāla Grove,</p>
<p>I will attain nirvāṇa. {53.15}</p>
<p>“In the city named Pāvā,</p>
<p>Near the Makuṭabandhana shrine,</p>
<p>On the pleasant bank of the river,</p>
<p>I will attain nirvāṇa on earth. {53.16}</p>
<p>“All the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>The śrāvakas with great magical powers,</p>
<p>The gods, nāgas, and yakṣas,</p>
<p>The powerful guardians of the world, {53.17}</p>
<p>“The Śakras, Brahmās, and Suyāmas,</p>
<p>As well as the gods of Akaniṣṭha, and so forth—</p>
<p>All of them will gather</p>
<p>At that place. {53.18}</p>
<p>“There, in the Yamakasāla Grove,</p>
<p>In the country of the Mallas,</p>
<p>Between the northern bank of the Gaṅgā</p>
<p>And the western bank of the Mahī, {53.19}</p>
<p>“On the south side of the Himalayas,</p>
<p>In the Sāla Grove—</p>
<p>In that place there will also be</p>
<p>My final resting place.{53.20}</p>
<p>“At that time, on the pleasant bank of the river,</p>
<p>On its sloping bank described as golden,</p>
<p>All the hosts of gods</p>
<p>And other beings will gather. {53.21}</p>
<p>“All the most eminent human kings,</p>
<p>And beings of human and nonhuman origin</p>
<p>Such as all the spirits and mortal beings,</p>
<p>Both the naive and the mature, {53.22}</p>
<p>“Will gather at that place</p>
<p>For that public event of great magnitude.</p>
<p>This divine celebration</p>
<p>Will be on the account of my physical remains. {53.23}</p>
<p>“Stepping then into the immaterial,</p>
<p>I will attain the peace of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Leaving behind phenomenal reality,</p>
<p>I will enter the ultimate reality. {53.24}</p>
<p>“My final birth occurred</p>
<p>In the city of Kapilavastu</p>
<p>Within the illustrious family of the Śākyas,</p>
<p>Where I was born into the prison of existence. {53.25}</p>
<p>“Then, leaving behind its inherent suffering,</p>
<p>I went forth from my home.</p>
<p>I visited many holy places</p>
<p>But still did not find the elixir of immortality. {53.26}</p>
<p>“I practiced severe austerities,</p>
<p>Mortifying my body.</p>
<p>Having fasted for six years,</p>
<p>I was on the verge of dying from exhaustion, {53.27}</p>
<p>“But I did not find anything</p>
<p>That would reveal [true] knowledge to me.</p>
<p>I got up, therefore, and partook of some food—</p>
<p>A delicious milk porridge. {53.28}</p>
<p>“Following the road indicated to me by the gods,</p>
<p>I traveled across the land,</p>
<p>To the bank of the Nairañjanā River,</p>
<p>Beautified by kingly trees, {53.29}</p>
<p>“Where the salty ground</p>
<p>Was strewn with various flowers,</p>
<p>And fine forest fruits abounded,</p>
<p>Produced by various trees. {53.30}</p>
<p>“Walking along the great river,</p>
<p>I came, in the end, to the foot of a tree.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw that this place was right for me,</p>
<p>A firm resolve was born in me. {53.31}</p>
<p>“Seeing also that this large tree</p>
<p>Was adorned with leafy branches</p>
<p>That afforded plenty of shade</p>
<p>And had root spurs that provided shelter,{53.32}</p>
<p>“I attained aśvattha-hood during the aśvattha,</p>
<p>Sitting at the foot of that [aśvattha] tree.</p>
<p>There, I attained stability,</p>
<p>Concentration, and samādhi.</p>
<p>At the end of the night I attained that which</p>
<p>Is not subject to destruction and ends [the cycle of] rebirth.{53.33}</p>
<p>“Māra cleverly deployed many vighnas</p>
<p>With many different forms,</p>
<p>But after his armies were defeated,</p>
<p>He turned back and returned to his abode. {53.34}</p>
<p>“It is because of him</p>
<p>That many mantra systems have been taught,</p>
<p>Along with many ritual methods,</p>
<p>Meditative concentrations, and knowledges. {53.35}</p>
<p>“The path, moreover, is threefold,</p>
<p>To serve each of the three types of beings.</p>
<p>The antidotes to the faults,</p>
<p>Likewise, are taught as threefold. {53.36}</p>
<p>“Then, I got up and went</p>
<p>To Urubilvā, with its auspicious waters.</p>
<p>Having bathed in the waters there,</p>
<p>I visited the local sage and his disciples. {53.37}</p>
<p>“After performing many acts for the sake of beings,</p>
<p>I set out once again</p>
<p>And in due course</p>
<p>Entered the beautiful city of Kāśī. {53.38}</p>
<p>“Having gone to the place</p>
<p>Where the former buddhas with great powers had gone,</p>
<p>I remained there myself</p>
<p>Among the local Kāśī folk. {53.39}</p>
<p>“Having turned the wheel of the sacred Dharma</p>
<p>That brings the peace of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>I taught the Dharma there</p>
<p>To bring about the happiness of all beings</p>
<p>Whose existence depends on the five vital airs,</p>
<p>Including gods and demigods. {53.40}</p>
<p>“The Dharma wheel was turned there</p>
<p>Before by the primordial buddhas.</p>
<p>I too taught</p>
<p>The unsurpassed Dharma wheel there. {53.41}</p>
<p>“To bring the happiness of release from saṃsāra</p>
<p>And to stop the faults of sentient beings,</p>
<p>I turned the great wheel</p>
<p>That brings the happiness of the final peace; {53.42}</p>
<p>“The wheel that is intended to destroy the path of becoming</p>
<p>And arises out of the samādhi of the four truths;</p>
<p>The wheel comprised of the eightfold path</p>
<p>And adorned with the four abodes of Brahmā;{53.43}</p>
<p>“The wheel from whose felly arises knowledge,</p>
<p>Thus blocking ignorance</p>
<p>Along with the twelvefold cycle</p>
<p>Of interdependent origination; {53.44}</p>
<p>“The wheel that spreads the absolute truth</p>
<p>Born, at its extreme edge, out of the ultimate reality;</p>
<p>The wheel whose greatness arises from its felly</p>
<p>With its forward and backward movements;{53.45}</p>
<p>“The auspicious wheel that spreads instructions</p>
<p>And brings liberation to many beings.</p>
<p>Having thus turned the wheel,</p>
<p>I left the pleasant city of Kāśī and proceeded to Śrāvastī. {53.46}</p>
<p>“There, I humbled the tīrthikas</p>
<p>With displays of miracles.</p>
<p>Similarly, I displayed a miraculous feat</p>
<p>In the district of Sāṅkāśya.{53.47}</p>
<p>“Having delighted the people who live</p>
<p>In the many places of pilgrimage,</p>
<p>I made an auspicious descent from the realm of gods</p>
<p>Among the people of Agnibhāṇḍa.{53.48}</p>
<p>“In the realm of the Thirty-Three</p>
<p>I introduced Śakra to the nature of phenomena,</p>
<p>And in Akaniṣṭha, and so forth, I did the same</p>
<p>With Brahmā and the others, including the Destroyer of Cities;{53.49}</p>
<p>“The lords of yakṣas, including Vaiśravaṇa;</p>
<p>The hordes belonging to the four great kings;</p>
<p>The sadāmatta and karoṭapāṇi gods;</p>
<p>The vīṇātṛtīyaka and mālādhārin gods; {53.50}</p>
<p>“All the gods and hosts of yakṣas</p>
<p>Who dwell on earth, in heaven, or in the space in between;</p>
<p>The noble leaders of yakṣa hosts;</p>
<p>And all the lower gods and asuras. {53.51}</p>
<p>“I introduced them to the fruit of the Dharma</p>
<p>And caused them to seek out the threefold nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>I established inconceivable numbers of beings</p>
<p>In a better state. {53.52}</p>
<p>“The number of these beings is incalculable,</p>
<p>As saṃsāra is infinite and has no end.</p>
<p>Within great thousandfold universes dwell inconceivable numbers</p>
<p>Of beings composed of the primary elements.{53.53}</p>
<p>“Having thus introduced many beings</p>
<p>To the true meaning,</p>
<p>I have now arrived and remain here,</p>
<p>Above the realm of the Pure Abode. {53.54}</p>
<p>“I turned the wheel of the sacred mantra teachings</p>
<p>That accord with the three vehicles</p>
<p>And established beings in discipline.</p>
<p>Further, I taught this king of manuals</p>
<p>Throughout the entire world</p>
<p>And am now giving it to Mañjughoṣa. {53.55}</p>
<p>“When I have passed from this world into the final nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And the earth is devoid of my presence,</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī will continue the work of the Buddha</p>
<p>For the sake of the beings there. {53.56}</p>
<p>“In order to preserve the sacred Dharma</p>
<p>When the victorious lords are in the state of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa will always</p>
<p>Guard it continually. {53.57}</p>
<p>“This extensive manual has been taught</p>
<p>In order to promulgate the mantra path.</p>
<p>During the terrible and dreadful time</p>
<p>At the end of the eon {53.58}</p>
<p>“The human kings will be very violent</p>
<p>And delight in killing one another.</p>
<p>They will commit evil acts and follow wrong conduct.</p>
<p>During the debased eon</p>
<p>Enjoyments will be few,</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt. {53.59}</p>
<p>“The kings of men will come</p>
<p>To worship in the Sāla Grove,</p>
<p>In the Makuṭabandhana temple,</p>
<p>And on the banks of the Hiraṇyavatī river. {53.60}</p>
<p>“When I have passed, on my bed, into final nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And have entered the sphere of peace,</p>
<p>My body, in a state of bliss but devoid of sensation,</p>
<p>Will be placed upon the funeral pyre. {53.61}</p>
<p>“Looking upon my former deeds,</p>
<p>The miracles I have performed,</p>
<p>And the guiding activity of the Buddha</p>
<p>That leads to the propriety of conduct, {53.62}</p>
<p>“And reflecting upon these auspicious and illustrious acts,</p>
<p>All the kings, along with the gods,</p>
<p>The asuras, and ordinary humans</p>
<p>Will offer worship to me. {53.63}</p>
<p>“All the earthly rulers, having come together,</p>
<p>Will offer worship amidst great celebrations</p>
<p>At that time, near to my body,</p>
<p>There is no doubt about that. {53.64}</p>
<p>“My physical body, a source of qualities,</p>
<p>Will be placed on the funeral pyre,</p>
<p>Its faults terminated and only the merit left.</p>
<p>It will be free from all nonvirtue</p>
<p>And its five empty aggregates</p>
<p>Will now arise as the corresponding [five] realities. {53.65}</p>
<p>“Upon seeing it,</p>
<p>Many beings will acquire great merit.</p>
<p>The great śrāvakas, great beings devoid of passions</p>
<p>And possessed of great powers,</p>
<p>And all the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who abide on the ten levels {53.66}</p>
<p>“Will all gather around,</p>
<p>Filled with compassion for all beings.</p>
<p>All the hosts of gods,</p>
<p>As well as the noble and ordinary people,{53.67}</p>
<p>“Will all congregate around</p>
<p>That single place of great merit.</p>
<p>They will attain the faith that rests upon</p>
<p>The understanding of impermanence and suffering. {53.68}</p>
<p>“All the hosts of spirits</p>
<p>Will be near the [funerary] caitya,</p>
<p>Making large offerings,</p>
<p>Wailing and crying. {53.69}</p>
<p>“They will shed profuse tears</p>
<p>And sob, overwhelmed by compassion.</p>
<p>They will lament over impermanence,</p>
<p>Suffering, and emptiness as follows: {53.70}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Buddha taught the Dharma</p>
<p>Here on earth, in the present time.</p>
<p>And now, this best of sages,</p>
<p>The eminent seventh bull of a sage,</p>
<p>Born among the Śākyas, the foremost of all beings,</p>
<p>Is seen by us for the last time. {53.71}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Blessed One, who taught us</p>
<p>Impermanence and suffering, is lying here.</p>
<p>He taught emptiness, the absolute truth,</p>
<p>And he explained the meaning of primordial peace.</p>
<p>Why, O gods, do you not wake up</p>
<p>Our lord and master? {53.72}</p>
<p>“ ‘Gathered here are all the Buddha’s sons</p>
<p>Of great miraculous powers</p>
<p>And the powerful śrāvakas,</p>
<p>Rich in religious merit and courage. {53.73}</p>
<p>“ ‘All the beings—men, gods, and asuras—</p>
<p>Are thoroughly distressed.</p>
<p>This is an occasion to continue</p>
<p>Turning the wheel of Dharma, {53.74}</p>
<p>“ ‘So rise up swiftly, O Blessed One!</p>
<p>May the Buddha’s sojourn [on earth] continue</p>
<p>For as long as the great ocean [of saṃsāra] lasts!</p>
<p>Do not neglect those sinking in it, O sage!{53.75}</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not disregard so many beings</p>
<p>By staying for a long time in a samādhi-like state.</p>
<p>Abandon meditative absorption</p>
<p>And teach the path to peaceful nirvāṇa.’{53.76}</p>
<p>“Lamenting, they will utter</p>
<p>Many words of this kind. {53.77}</p>
<p>“Then all these powerful gods,</p>
<p>And all their hosts, will fall silent.</p>
<p>Having wailed so much,</p>
<p>They will now wait, bowing respectfully.{53.78}</p>
<p>“Then the gods and the asuras, Brahmā and so forth,</p>
<p>Will cry for a long time, uttering shrill cries</p>
<p>With stammering voices</p>
<p>And throats choked by grief. {53.79}</p>
<p>“All the human-born kings,</p>
<p>Sitting on the ground, [will say,]</p>
<p>‘The liberated one born into the Śākya clan,</p>
<p>Free from passion and very powerful,</p>
<p>Is none other than the great Buddha,</p>
<p>The knowing one, the god of gods.’{53.80}</p>
<p>“A young monk by the name Aniruddha,</p>
<p>Human-born and virtuous,</p>
<p>Distinguished by his subtlety and ability,</p>
<p>Excelling in recitation and conduct,</p>
<p>Surrounded by a retinue</p>
<p>Of eminent arhats and kings, {53.81}</p>
<p>“Will then say to the Malla kings and subjects</p>
<p>Sighing in anguish,</p>
<p>Their minds moist with compassion,</p>
<p>The following sweet words: {53.82}</p>
<p>“ ‘My friends, do not</p>
<p>Set this pyre here aflame</p>
<p>Until the Blessed One’s foremost son,</p>
<p>The fount of the Dharma, has arrived. {53.83}</p>
<p>“ ‘His name is Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>And he is a śrāvaka of great miraculous power.</p>
<p>He possesses the intelligence of a great sage,</p>
<p>And was born a brahmin, free from worldliness. {53.84}</p>
<p>“ ‘He was born among the Magadhans</p>
<p>And spends his time in meditative equipoise there,</p>
<p>On a hill, under a pipal tree that affords shelter,</p>
<p>Near the fine city of Rājagṛha. {53.85}</p>
<p>“ ‘He will swiftly arrive here;</p>
<p>He would not do otherwise.</p>
<p>The deity that he worships</p>
<p>Would surely put out the kindling flame, {53.86}</p>
<p>“ ‘So do not light the pyre just yet,</p>

<p>The foremost son of the Sage, {53.87}</p>
<p>“ ‘Circumambulates [the remains of] the guru,</p>

<p>In the caitya ignite.</p>
<p>So do not, all of you, perform this vain labor</p>
<p>That is nothing but [pointless] toil.’ {53.89}</p>
<p>“Being thus told</p>
<p>By the sagacious Aniruddha,</p>
<p>All the Malla men and their kings</p>
<p>Will remain seated. {53.90}</p>
<p>“Because I was born among humans,</p>
<p>And was nurtured by them,</p>
<p>With the attendant pleasures of many kinds</p>
<p>And other benefits, such as those arising from the arts and crafts; {53.91}</p>
<p>“Because I attained awakening among humans,</p>
<p>On earth, at the foot of the [Bodhi] tree;</p>

<p>The Dharma that benefits all sentient beings, {53.92}</p>
<p>“It is fit for human beings alone</p>
<p>To light the funeral pyre.</p>
<p>Since I attained preeminence among all beings</p>
<p>As a human being,</p>
<p>My peaceful final nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Is destined to take place in the human world. {53.93}</p>
<p>“Whatever buddhas came in the past,</p>
<p>Will come in the future, or are active at present,</p>
<p>All of them are born in a human body</p>
<p>In this human world. {53.94}</p>
<p>“All of them are born, attain awakening,</p>
<p>Turn the auspicious Dharma wheel,</p>
<p>And enter the peace [of final] nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Because the pratyeka­buddhas and the noble śrāvakas</p>
<p>Also take a human birth and attain unsurpassable peace,</p>
<p>This attainment is regarded as threefold.{53.95}</p>
<p>“I have assisted [human beings]</p>
<p>For inconceivable eons.</p>
<p>When I pass into the state of final peace,</p>
<p>Cool and not subject to arising,</p>
<p>I will leave behind my relics there,</p>
<p>On the earth devoid of my presence, {53.96}</p>
<p>“For the benefit of the human beings</p>
<p>On whom I wish to bestow the benefits of worship.</p>
<p>The relics will likewise be for the lower gods and asuras,</p>
<p>For the ṛṣis,yakṣas, and garuḍas, {53.97}</p>
<p>“For the rākṣasas, pretas, and kuṣmāṇḍas,</p>
<p>For the powerful piśācas,</p>
<p>For all the spirits including</p>
<p>The grahas and the mātṛs, {53.98}</p>
<p>“And likewise for all the innumerable worlds</p>
<p>With their inconceivable world spheres</p>
<p>That support all [types of] life.</p>
<p>The relics will be left behind on the earth,</p>
<p>Destitute at that time of my presence,</p>
<p>For the purpose of worship. {53.99}</p>
<p>“Any mortals who arrive for these substances,</p>
<p>Any celestial kings or other beings,</p>
<p>Such as the inhabitants of the subterranean paradises,</p>
<p>The powerful lords of the dānavas,</p>
<p>The nāga kings, and the daityas,</p>
<p>Will each separately take my relics. {53.100}</p>
<p>“Bereft of their valued object</p>
<p>But endowed with good qualities,</p>
<p>These powerful beings will take [the relics]</p>
<p>To their own abodes and worship them.{53.101}</p>
<p>“All of them will become, without a doubt,</p>
<p>Buddhas with great miraculous powers.</p>
<p>Depending on their clarity of mind,</p>
<p>They will fall into three categories—the highest, the lower, and the middle.{53.102}</p>
<p>“They will thus become, in this threefold universe,</p>
<p>Either buddhas, or rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas, or arhats.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there will arise in the world</p>
<p>Three vehicles of three different types:{53.103}</p>
<p>“There will be (1) those who become liberated</p>
<p>Based on the practices of the path described as Great Vehicle.</p>
<p>There will also be, at that time in the world,</p>
<p>(2) Those who attain awakening and become liberated by themselves. {53.104}</p>
<p>“And there will also be (3) the śrāvakas,</p>
<p>Freed from passions and endowed with miraculous powers.</p>
<p>Thus, there will be at that time in the world</p>
<p>Beings adorned with this threefold family affiliation. {53.105}</p>
<p>“Kings who enjoy great comforts</p>
<p>Yet exercise their imperial might with great gentleness,</p>
<p>Will enjoy, as human beings,</p>
<p>Divine fortunes for a long time,</p>
<p>And when they eventually die,</p>
<p>They will attain one of the three kinds of peace. {53.106}</p>
<p>“The previous buddhas since the beginning,</p>
<p>And those of the present and future too,</p>
<p>All followed the same course</p>
<p>As the one displayed here. {53.107}</p>
<p>“All the deities sitting there</p>
<p>At the place of my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Will become disturbed and upset,</p>
<p>And their voices will falter. {53.108}</p>
<p>“They will all say at that time,</p>
<p>‘Alas, this is impermanence!</p>
<p>The buddhas with great miraculous powers</p>
<p>Pass from this world into final nirvāṇa.’ {53.109}</p>
<p>“All the powerful divine kings,</p>
<p>Having said this,</p>
<p>Will experience anguish in their hearts</p>
<p>And will remain silent. {53.110}</p>
<p>“Among the noble people of Magadha</p>
<p>Who dwell in the city of Kuśāgrapura,</p>
<p>Not far from there,</p>
<p>On the mountain called Vārāha,</p>
<p>There meditates a monk,</p>
<p>Sheltered by [the root spurs of] a pipal tree.{53.111}</p>
<p>“He is a śrāvaka and my foremost heart son,</p>
<p>The fount of the Dharma.</p>
<p>His name is Mahākāśyapa and he will be sitting,</p>
<p>At that time, in his fine shelter. {53.112}</p>
<p>“Having eaten his supply of alms,</p>
<p>He will sit and reflect as follows:</p>
<p>‘I have spent a lot of time</p>
<p>Paying homage to the Buddha, the great sage.</p>
<p>Now I would like to visit</p>
<p>That supreme, spontaneously arisen person. {53.113}</p>
<p>“ ‘Where is the Blessed One staying,</p>
<p>This most virtuous sage of the Śākyas?’</p>
<p>Mahākāśyapa, the king of brahmins, will thus focus his mind</p>
<p>On the Blessed One while remaining at his place. {53.114}</p>
<p>“He will perceive the sage of sages</p>
<p>With his mind alone.</p>
<p>He will also see, with the divine eye,</p>
<p>The world [where he lives] and all the [other] worlds: {53.115}</p>
<p>“Akaniṣṭha and other such worlds</p>
<p>With their luminous world spheres,</p>
<p>And all the worlds that are named after all their beings</p>
<p>And are part of great thousandfold worlds within still greater units.{53.116}</p>
<p>“Looking with his divine eye</p>
<p>As far as the śrāvakas can,</p>
<p>He will see the Teacher passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Peaceful, emancipated, and immaterial, {53.117}</p>
<p>“Surrounded on all sides</p>
<p>By hosts of very powerful gods</p>
<p>As well as human kings,</p>
<p>Asuras, yakṣas, rākṣasas,</p>
<p>And all the hosts of spirits,</p>
<p>And also by the bodhisattvas with great powers, {53.118}</p>
<p>“Śrāvakas of great renown</p>
<p>Who excel in wisdom,</p>
<p>And noble celestials and humans</p>
<p>Both with and without passion. {53.119}</p>
<p>“He will see the valiant one upon the funeral pyre—</p>
<p>The Buddha, a relative of the sun,</p>
<p>The god of gods,</p>
<p>The supreme and most virtuous lord of sages, {53.120}</p>
<p>“Surrounded on all sides</p>
<p>By the earthly kings,</p>
<p>Including the mighty Mallas,</p>
<p>Holding in their hands lamps, fragrances, and grass torches. {53.121}</p>
<p>“As explained by the monk Aniruddha,</p>
<p>Who keeps his observances,</p>
<p>The kings, held back by the gods,</p>
<p>Will be unable to light the pyre. {53.122}</p>
<p>“The earth goddess will wail loudly,</p>
<p>Her voice choked by tears.</p>
<p>There will be terrible exclamations of ‘alas, alas!’</p>
<p>And the sound of thunder will resound.{53.123}</p>
<p>“The grove will be divinely filled with hosts of ṛṣis</p>
<p>And apsarases singing praises;</p>
<p>It will resound with songs of siddhas and vidyādharīs,</p>
<p>And with the singing of kinnaras. {53.124}</p>
<p>“There will be the sweet cooing</p>
<p>And beautiful warbling of birds</p>
<p>And lovely sounds of various instruments</p>
<p>Played by celestials and humans. {53.125}</p>
<p>“The Sāla Grove will be</p>
<p>Filled with the songs of apsarases,</p>
<p>Graced with the presence of siddhas and vidyādharas,</p>
<p>And full of yogins all over. {53.126}</p>
<p>“The fine bed of the bull among sages</p>
<p>Will [thus] be surrounded on all sides,</p>
<p>And above it, Kāśyapa will sigh with grief,</p>
<p>Even though he is normally free from sorrow. {53.127}</p>
<p>“Shedding tears,</p>
<p>The monk Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>Foremost among my śrāvaka-disciples,</p>
<p>Will then collapse on the ground {53.128}</p>
<p>“And promptly cry out,</p>
<p>‘Alas! A difficult time has begun</p>
<p>Where the Buddha, free from karmic traits,</p>
<p>Has now passed into final nirvāṇa. {53.129}</p>
<p>“ ‘He himself taught, in this world,</p>
<p>About impermanence, suffering, and emptiness.</p>
<p>I see nothing permanent;</p>
<p>Everything must undergo successive rebirth.’{53.130}</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa will then quickly get up</p>
<p>And go to the king of the Magadhans,</p>
<p>Ajātaśatru, who will be in a state of anguish,</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by grief for his father.{53.131}</p>
<p>“Having arrived in his house,</p>
<p>Kāśyapa will say to the king,</p>
<p>‘O great king! The perfect Buddha,</p>
<p>Supreme among two-legged beings, has passed into nirvāṇa. {53.132}</p>
<p>“ ‘Quickly prepare a carriage,</p>
<p>And let’s go to the Teacher’s side!</p>
<p>He is lying on a bed on the ground,</p>
<p>His mind free from feverish agitation,</p>
<p>Beyond any enmity or fear,</p>
<p>Abiding in the supreme body of bliss.’ {53.133}</p>
<p>“Hearing the painful news,</p>
<p>The king will become even more distressed.</p>
<p>Expressing his inner lament,</p>
<p>He will say the following words: {53.134}</p>
<p>“ ‘I have lost both</p>
<p>My Teacher and my father.</p>
<p>I have been abandoned by all my relatives,</p>
<p>And the people, likewise, do not trust me.</p>
<p>When I fall into the terrible hell,</p>
<p>In whom will I find my refuge? {53.135}</p>
<p>“ ‘Protect me, O great hero,</p>
<p>Foremost śrāvaka of the Teacher!</p>
<p>Mahākāśyapa of great splendor!</p>
<p>There is no life for me in this world.’ {53.136}</p>
<p>“Having spoken this, the king,</p>
<p>The chief ruler of the Magadhans,</p>
<p>Will suddenly collapse on the ground</p>
<p>At the feet of the distinguished śrāvaka.</p>
<p>He will lie on the ground, stripped of his will,</p>
<p>Motionless and unconscious.{53.137}</p>
<p>“At that time, you, Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Divine youth of great magical power,</p>
<p>Will visit places around the world</p>
<p>With the wish to benefit beings.{53.138}</p>
<p>“When my body is placed on the pyre</p>
<p>At its location in the grove,</p>
<p>You will also sit there,</p>
<p>Surrounded by a host of bodhisattvas. {53.139}</p>
<p>“Having prepared my body</p>
<p>To be worshiped there, on the earth,</p>
<p>You will look at the beings around and reflect,</p>
<p>‘Which of them are suffering? Whom can I save?’{53.140}</p>
<p>“When I lie there on the ground, there will be you,</p>
<p>Divine youth with the profound understanding of the truth.</p>
<p>You, Mañjuśrī, will be able to enthrall</p>
<p>The greatly suffering King Ajātaśatru.{53.141}</p>
<p>“Even though [Mahākāśyapa] will be there,</p>
<p>It is you alone who will be able to guide the king,</p>
<p>Because what is possible for the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Is not possible even for the magically endowed beings,</p>
<p>Such as deities, ṛṣis, and so forth</p>
<p>Or the pratyeka­buddhas and noble śrāvakas. {53.142}</p>
<p>“The king, lying there,</p>
<p>Will see you, Mañjughoṣa, as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Given by you a special power,</p>
<p>The king, fallen into a swoon from his grief,{53.143}</p>
<p>“Will see in a dream</p>
<p>The clear form of a young boy—</p>
<p>The all-pervading, divine youth,</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa of great power. {53.144}</p>
<p>“Through you grace, Mañjuśrī, he will see you,</p>
<p>A bodhisattva with the form of a child</p>
<p>Who is the magical manifestation of the Dharma,</p>
<p>With manifold, inconceivable power.{53.145}</p>
<p>“The king will fall into the Avīci hell</p>
<p>But then will rapidly rise up</p>
<p>Through the different states of being,</p>
<p>His lower rebirths having been auspiciously purified,</p>
<p>And will also experience the merits of higher births</p>
<p>That are shunned by all the śrāvakas. {53.146}</p>
<p>“When he has thus completely purified</p>
<p>His string of crimes,</p>
<p>King Ajātaśatru will enjoy</p>
<p>Immense pleasures. {53.147}</p>
<p>“This teaching, presented here only briefly,</p>
<p>Is nevertheless adorned with a wide range of distinctive meanings.</p>
<p>It represents the speech of all the buddhas</p>
<p>In the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.</p>
<p>This extensive manual has thus been taught</p>
<p>In order to benefit all beings. {53.148}</p>
<p>“You, divine youth, will, at that time,</p>
<p>With your all-reaching words of Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Guide the kings</p>
<p>Who perpetrate evil acts. {53.149}</p>
<p>“The range of your miraculous powers is inconceivable,</p>
<p>And the number of those you will guide is inconceivable too.</p>
<p>You will become the guide</p>
<p>For all the classes of beings.” {53.150}</p>
<p>So spoke the great hero  to Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>The great light of the buddhas,</p>
<p>Who, at that time, was staying</p>
<p>Above the realm of the Pure Abode.</p>
<p>The best of speakers, the perfect buddha,</p>
<p>Supreme among two-legged beings, addressed [Mañjughoṣa again]: {53.151}</p>
<p>“After taking, over many eons,</p>
<p>Innumerable human births,</p>
<p>Too many to be counted or conceived of,</p>
<p>You will be the perfect buddha,</p>
<p>Mañjudhvaja by name,</p>
<p>In the human world. {53.152}</p>
<p>“Then, having performed the acts of a buddha</p>
<p>In the correct order as always occurs,</p>
<p>And having liberated many beings,</p>
<p>You will enter final nirvāṇa.” {53.153}</p>
<p>Thus addressed, the divine youth of great power,</p>
<p>With the form of a young boy,</p>
<p>Let out a long sigh,</p>
<p>Awestruck and overcome with compassion. {53.154}</p>
<p>Shedding tears,</p>
<p>He looked at the Buddha for a long time.</p>
<p>Then, with his hands folded in salutation,</p>
<p>He sat down again. {53.155}</p>
<p>[The Buddha continued to speak:]</p>
<p>“On the earth down below,</p>
<p>The emperor Ajātaśatru</p>
<p>Will bow his head to the brahmin,</p>
<p>The wonderful Mahākāśyapa. {53.156}</p>
<p>“Now awake and back to his senses,</p>
<p>He will bow down to [Mahākāśyapa’s] feet</p>
<p>And, letting out a long sigh,</p>
<p>Will announce his aim in full. {53.157}</p>
<p>“Taking his seat, the son of the late king,</p>
<p>The great lord, Ajātaśatru by name,</p>
<p>Will then say to Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>‘Let us go to the place of cremation,</p>
<p>Where people worthy of help</p>
<p>Worship the one interred under the caitya dome.’{53.158}</p>
<p>“The eminent śrāvaka, endowed with many powers,</p>
<p>Will however remain in the same place</p>
<p>And explain his intentions [to Ajātaśatru]:</p>
<p>‘It is not proper for me to use my magical power;</p>
<p>I would like to proceed</p>
<p>To that great funerary gathering on foot.’ {53.159}</p>
<p>“He will then set out to see the Teacher</p>
<p>In his final journey.</p>
<p>On the way, the vow holder [Mahākāśyapa]</p>
<p>Will stop at the monastery that is midway,{53.160}</p>
<p>“So that he can look up</p>
<p>The monastery’s occupants,</p>
<p>Particularly, a newly ordained elderly monk</p>
<p>Who is sinful and deluded.{53.161}</p>
<p>“Seeing the approaching figure,</p>
<p>The elderly monk will come forward</p>
<p>To meet this most illustrious brahmin,</p>
<p>Who fasted for a long time, pure and free from illness. {53.162}</p>
<p>“Having approached,</p>
<p>He will bow to his feet</p>
<p>And say to the illustrious guest,</p>
<p>‘Welcome! What brings you here?{53.163}</p>
<p>“ ‘Or where are you going?</p>
<p>Are you leaving soon, or are you going to stay?’</p>
<p>He will say that to the sage [Mahākāśyapa],</p>
<p>Who will reply to the fool, ‘Long-lived one! Have you not heard? {53.164}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Teacher of the whole world,</p>
<p>The perfect Buddha, supreme among two-legged beings,</p>
<p>My father, a buddha of great wisdom,</p>
<p>Is extinguished like the flame of a lamp. {53.165}</p>
<p>“ ‘The great hero has departed,</p>
<p>And the earth has become empty.</p>
<p>All the worlds are likewise empty,</p>
<p>And empty too are the regions for me.’ {53.166}</p>
<p>“Thereupon, the elderly monk</p>
<p>With the twisted mind of a fool will rejoice.</p>
<p>Laughing in ridicule, he will say,</p>
<p>‘Is that old geezer dead? {53.167}</p>
<p>“ ‘The one with long arms</p>
<p>And the head lofty as a parasol?</p>
<p>Our chief guide</p>
<p>Steeped in his ‘learned’ ignorance?{53.168}</p>
<p>“ ‘Now that he is gone,</p>
<p>I will promptly do whatever I want.’</p>
<p>Powerful Mahākāśyapa, his hair standing on end,</p>
<p>Being thus addressed by the old monk, {53.169}</p>
<p>“Will knit his brows in angry contortion</p>
<p>And employ the syllable hūṁ.</p>
<p>The brahmin, habituated to asceticism,</p>
<p>Will be furious at that moment. {53.170}</p>
<p>“He will strike the ground,</p>
<p>At that moment, with his toe,</p>
<p>And the entire earth will sway</p>
<p>With a loud thunder coming from the mountains. {53.171}</p>
<p>“All the oceans will become agitated,</p>
<p>All the trees, mountains,</p>
<p>Valleys, and caves will quake,</p>
<p>And all the nāgas and deities dwelling there will tremble. {53.172}</p>
<p>“The light of the moon and the sun</p>
<p>Will disappear on earth at that time.</p>
<p>The winds will die down,</p>
<p>And meteors will fall.{53.173}</p>
<p>“He, One Syllable with the sound hūṁ,</p>
<p>When pronounced like this by the śrāvakas,</p>
<p>Is the manifestation of the family</p>
<p>And auspiciously accomplishes all activities.{53.174}</p>
<p>“Even when he is not fully mastered,</p>
<p>This king of mantras, just by being recited,</p>
<p>Arrests all weapons and poisons,</p>
<p>Whether they be of animate or inanimate origin. {53.175}</p>
<p>“Through merely being recited,</p>
<p>He paralyzes all evil beings</p>
<p>And accomplishes other specific activities</p>
<p>Of many different types. {53.176}</p>
<p>“The garrulous old monk</p>
<p>Will fall silent and remain so thenceforth,</p>
<p>Humbled by [the display of] magical power</p>
<p>And chastised, at that moment, by Mahākāśyapa. {53.177}</p>
<p>“He will then be led by this eminent śrāvaka</p>
<p>To where the funeral pyre is.</p>
<p>The monk Mahākāśyapa, free from desire,</p>
<p>Exceedingly powerful, will travel there on foot. {53.178}</p>
<p>“Having arrived, he will see</p>
<p>The Sage’s body laid upon the funeral pyre,</p>
<p>And many groups of gods</p>
<p>Worshiping it with large offerings. {53.179}</p>
<p>“He will see the funeral pyre,</p>
<p>With the body of the sage Gautama mounted upon it,</p>
<p>Provided with the best accoutrements</p>
<p>And adorned with all the [required] articles.{53.180}</p>
<p>“When they see the wonderful,</p>
<p>Illustrious Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>All the monks,</p>
<p>Free from faults and very dignified,{53.181}</p>
<p>“And all the hosts of gods and spirits,</p>
<p>Will exclaim, ‘Alas, alas!’</p>
<p>They will wail with loud cries,</p>
<p>Outpourings of their sorrow. {53.182}</p>
<p>“All the powerful gods and nāgas</p>
<p>Will come forward</p>
<p>And say to the illustrious one,</p>
<p>‘Pay respects to the supreme among two-legged beings! {53.183}</p>
<p>“ ‘All the hosts of gods and all the people</p>
<p>Have been waiting for you;</p>
<p>The hosts of spirits,</p>
<p>The ṛṣis, the yakṣas, and the human kings</p>
<p>All tried to light the funeral pyre</p>
<p>But were unable to.’ {53.184}</p>
<p>“The illustrious one, free from faults</p>
<p>And endowed with great powers,</p>
<p>Will circumambulate [the pyre] many times clockwise.</p>
<p>Recollecting the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>He will pay his respects</p>
<p>At the edge of the pyre with great dignity. {53.185}</p>
<p>“He will break open the iron casket</p>
<p>So that the two feet emerge.</p>
<p>Bowing his head at the feet [of the Blessed One],</p>
<p>He will touch them again and again. {53.186}</p>
<p>“Having thus repeatedly looked</p>
<p>At the fine feet of the eminent sage,</p>
<p>He will again lay them to rest</p>
<p>In the iron casket. {53.187}</p>
<p>“The powerful one who is free from desire</p>
<p>Will then rise up and take his seat</p>
<p>Among the powerful arhats,</p>
<p>Who are also free from desire. {53.188}</p>
<p>“The Magadhan king</p>
<p>Will approach the funeral pyre</p>
<p>At the head of a procession of chariots</p>
<p>Drawn by elephants and horses. {53.189}</p>
<p>“Then other kings, commanders of great forces,</p>
<p>Will arrive there, all of them with their armies,</p>
<p>To pay respects</p>
<p>To the sage Śākyamuni, {53.190}</p>
<p>“Who passed into nirvāṇa lying on the ground,</p>
<p>In a peaceful spot at the edge of the forest,</p>

<p>And abiding in ultimate reality. {53.191}</p>
<p>“The Magadhan king,</p>

<p>And, tormented by anguish, {53.194}</p>
<p>“Will approach Mahākāśyapa</p>

<p>In a stammering and faltering voice: {53.195}</p>
<p>“ ‘My teacher has passed into nirvāṇa today;</p>
<p>Now I am without a protector.</p>
<p>He indicated that you alone</p>
<p>Will be my refuge and protection. {53.196}</p>
<p>“ ‘The moon-like sage prophesied</p>
<p>That I, continuing at your side,</p>
<p>Will remove all my afflictions</p>
<p>And attain arhatship. {53.197}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Victorious One revealed</p>
<p>During the last watch of the night</p>
<p>That I am selected to be always with you</p>
<p>Until I have passed into final nirvāṇa. {53.198}</p>
<p>“ ‘Desiring what is beneficial, he appointed you</p>
<p>To carry out the work of the Buddha.</p>
<p>The great Sage has passed into the final peace,</p>
<p>Leaving me behind in distress.’ {53.199}</p>
<p>“The sagacious Aniruddha</p>
<p>Will comfort the pious monk:</p>
<p>‘Do not cry in distress!</p>
<p>Do not fall into despair! {53.200}</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not go to any other place,</p>
<p>But stay here.</p>
<p>Mahākāśyapa himself will be our teacher</p>
<p>When the “eye of the world” is extinguished. {53.201}</p>
<p>“ ‘It was prophesied here by the Sage</p>
<p>That he will carry on the Buddha’s work,</p>
<p>And we will follow him,</p>
<p>Along with you. {53.202}</p>
<p>“ ‘As for his magical powers,</p>
<p>Great distinction, energy, and great splendor,</p>
<p>Mahākāśyapa is the second Teacher, as it were,</p>
<p>His exact replica here on earth. {53.203}</p>
<p>“ ‘For as long as Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>This eminent śrāvaka of great power,</p>
<p>Remains and holds fast,</p>
<p>Do not fall into despair.’ {53.204}</p>
<p>“Talking thus, all the sons of the Sage,</p>
<p>Endowed with magical powers,</p>
<p>Free from desire, and very studious,</p>
<p>Will sit down.{53.205}</p>
<p>“The pyre will be lit</p>
<p>By the Malla kings.</p>
<p>It will blaze on all sides</p>
<p>And then change into ashes. {53.206}</p>
<p>“Seeing this, the hosts of gods</p>
<p>And the serpent-hooded mahoragas,</p>
<p>In order to cool down the pyre ground,</p>
<p>Will release a heavy shower {53.207}</p>
<p>“Of sandalwood water,</p>
<p>Followed by, the next instant,</p>
<p>A great rain of flowers</p>
<p>Released upon the earth. {53.208}</p>
<p>“Instantly, all who came</p>
<p>To worship the relics of the Victorious One</p>
<p>Will all start fighting</p>
<p>With each other. {53.209}</p>
<p>“The Brahmās, the Śakras, the Yāmas,</p>
<p>And all the hosts of gods</p>
<p>Will be held back by the śrāvakas</p>
<p>With great magical powers. {53.210}</p>
<p>“Mahākāśyapa will distribute the relics</p>
<p>Born from the body of the Victorious One.</p>
<p>He will give only a small portion to everyone,</p>
<p>So that they may be worshiped,</p>
<p>Since they bring the final peace,</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the three vehicles. {53.211}</p>
<p>“Then Mahākāśyapa, a yogi</p>
<p>Free from desire and very powerful,</p>
<p>Will reflect upon the memorable words</p>
<p>Spoken by the unruly old monk, and say: {53.212}</p>
<p>“ ‘The entirety of the great doctrine that brings happiness,</p>
<p>With its twelve branches that comprise</p>
<p>The Sūtra, the Vinaya, and the Abhidharma,</p>
<p>Might vanish like smoke in the sky.</p>
<p>When the great hero has departed,</p>
<p>The destruction of the doctrine will follow. {53.213}</p>
<p>“ ‘All the teachings spoken by the Buddha</p>
<p>Should be collected together.</p>
<p>Let us all go together,</p>
<p>Free from desire and dignified,</p>
<p>To the capital city of the Magadhans,</p>
<p>The fine city referred to as ‘royal’;{53.214}</p>
<p>“ ‘To beautiful Kuśāgrapura,</p>
<p>With its nice, high mountains;</p>
<p>And to Vaiśālī, a nice place</p>
<p>Where there is a beautiful caitya.’ {53.215}</p>
<p>“All the lamenting Mallas,</p>
<p>Together with the dignified [śrāvakas],</p>
<p>Will do many such [peregrinations] then</p>
<p>For the sake of the teachings.{53.216}</p>
<p>“At the end of the eon,</p>
<p>When I have passed away,</p>
<p>The kings will delight</p>
<p>In killing one another. {53.217}</p>
<p>“Monks will engage in many types of business,</p>
<p>And beings will be rendered senseless by greed.</p>
<p>At the end of the eon, the male and female</p>
<p>Lay practitioners will have no faith.</p>
<p>Dedicated to mutual slaughter,</p>
<p>They will search each other out.{53.218}</p>
<p>“Armed with ‘piercing’ weapons,</p>
<p>They will ever inflict wounds and bring harm.</p>
<p>Monks will lack self-control</p>
<p>At the end of the eon, when the Sage is gone. {53.219}</p>
<p>“At that time, there will be on earth</p>
<p>Eight arhats with great magical powers,</p>
<p>Free from desire and karmic traits.</p>
<p>They will be tasked with protecting my doctrine. {53.220}</p>
<p>“These distinguished arhats</p>
<p>Will be those known as Rāhula and so forth.</p>
<p>It will not be possible to see them</p>
<p>At that time during the debased eon. {53.221}</p>
<p>“However, the practitioners of mantra, when accomplished,</p>
<p>Will be able to see them without fail.</p>
<p>All of them, appointed here by me,</p>
<p>Will use the mantras of magic and possess great powers. {53.222}</p>
<p>“I have invested them, the glorious ones,</p>
<p>With the authority to administer justice.</p>
<p>Any student who disobeys their orders</p>
<p>Will be guilty of transgression. {53.223}</p>
<p>“If you hold on to the sacred Dharma—</p>
<p>To the ultimate reality beyond the physical—</p>
<p>And proclaim on earth</p>
<p>This meritorious message of mine, {53.224}</p>
<p>“Then you will obtain the peace of no-self</p>
<p>And enter the final nirvāṇa without karmic traits.</p>
<p>When the Sage and his teaching have disappeared,</p>
<p>The following will come to pass: {53.225}</p>
<p>“The monks and nuns who live on alms</p>
<p>Will all become very greedy.</p>
<p>Ever acting as detestable beggars,</p>
<p>They will proliferate during the debased eon. {53.226}</p>
<p>“The practice of keeping houses and wives</p>
<p>Will become integrated into my doctrine.</p>
<p>Lay practitioners, at that time,</p>
<p>Will always have sex with the wives of others. {53.227}</p>
<p>“The fourfold assembly will remain</p>
<p>In name only, merely to keep appearances.</p>
<p>They will all bring harm upon one another,</p>
<p>Delighting in enmity. {53.228}</p>
<p>“The entire earth will be taken over</p>
<p>By the tīrthikas and [saṃsāric] gods;</p>
<p>People, at that time,</p>
<p>Will adore the brahmin caste. {53.229}</p>
<p>“Deluded and following wrong conduct,</p>
<p>They will delight in harming living beings.</p>
<p>This has been prophesied for this lowest eon,</p>
<p>When I enter into final nirvāṇa. {53.230}</p>
<p>“Many men and women will</p>
<p>Continuously indulge in adultery.</p>
<p>They will all delight in nonvirtue</p>
<p>And shun virtuous values. {53.231}</p>
<p>“After I enter the final peace on earth,</p>
<p>Many beings will be present,</p>
<p>Worshiping my body,</p>
<p>Such as the hosts of gods of great vitality and splendor, {53.232}</p>
<p>“Men of distinction,</p>
<p>Hosts of yakṣas and spirits,</p>
<p>Asuras, gandharvas,</p>
<p>Kinnaras endowed with great powers, {53.233}</p>
<p>“Garuḍas, nāgas,</p>
<p>Rākṣasas, ṛṣis,</p>
<p>Siddhas, yogins,</p>
<p>Planets with great vitality,{53.234}</p>
<p>“Beings of various types</p>
<p>That take birth based on their different destinies</p>
<p>And are caught in the chain of saṃsāric rebirths,</p>
<p>And also the wise ones who have broken this chain. {53.235}</p>
<p>“They will make offerings to my body,</p>
<p>From which the pangs of fever have departed,</p>
<p>On the bank of the Hiraṇyavatī,</p>
<p>In the Yamakasāla Grove, {53.236}</p>
<p>“In the Makuṭabandhana shrine,</p>
<p>In the country of the Mallas.</p>
<p>When I pass into final nirvāṇa there,</p>
<p>I will attain the peace that is free from fear. {53.237}</p>
<p>“My relics will be exhumed,</p>
<p>With some being stolen</p>
<p>By gods, asuras,</p>
<p>And all types of spirits.</p>
<p>They will be divided into separate portions</p>
<p>And then distributed. {53.238}</p>
<p>“At that time, the Magadhan king Ajātaśatru,</p>
<p>Together with his great army,</p>
<p>Will make a request to all the śrāvakas</p>
<p>Endowed with great magical powers: {53.239}</p>
<p>“ ‘Please, great beings,</p>
<p>Uplift me also,</p>
<p>Crestfallen and suffering,</p>
<p>Even though I am a patricide without merit.’ {53.240}</p>
<p>“The most eminent, wise śrāvaka,</p>
<p>The dear son of the Buddha</p>
<p>Called Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>Who brings benefit to beings, {53.241}</p>
<p>“Seeing this intelligent man called Ajātaśatru</p>
<p>And noticing his distress,</p>
<p>Will give him then his due attention</p>
<p>And bless him with his magical power. {53.242}</p>
<p>“He will pick up a portion of relics</p>
<p>Produced from the body of the Victorious One.</p>
<p>The remaining relics will be taken by the others,</p>
<p>Including very powerful snake-like beings.{53.243}</p>
<p>“Each trying to be quicker than the other,</p>
<p>They will push and shove in great agitation.</p>
<p>They will then carry the relics through space</p>
<p>To their own abodes and install them there.{53.244}</p>
<p>“The monk Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>The most eminent śrāvaka,</p>
<p>Will, at that time, reflect on the Sage:{53.245}</p>
<p>“ ‘Ah, woe to humankind!</p>
<p>He is absent from this earthly round</p>
<p>With its buddhas, pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>And śrāvakas with great miraculous powers. {53.246}</p>
<p>“ ‘The light has gone out for beings</p>
<p>Who wander in the prison of saṃsāra.</p>
<p>They will now experience various types</p>
<p>Of acute suffering for a long time. {53.247}</p>
<p>“ ‘If, however, they worship the relics</p>
<p>Of the savior, the lord of the world,</p>
<p>They will experience the pleasures</p>
<p>Of the god realms in abundance. {53.248}</p>
<p>“ ‘They will obtain kingdoms, prosperity,</p>
<p>And mantric accomplishments, so difficult to attain.</p>
<p>They will attain the various things</p>
<p>That reflect the lifestyles of favorable rebirths, {53.249}</p>
<p>“ ‘Including the desired boon of reaching the peak of existence</p>
<p>That is adorned with the threefold liberation.</p>
<p>By worshiping the relics</p>
<p>They will attain the supreme accomplishment.’ {53.250}</p>
<p>“Reflecting like this,</p>
<p>The world-renowned brahmin,</p>
<p>The śrāvaka and the distinguished sage</p>
<p>By the name Kāśyapa, {53.251}</p>
<p>“Will pick up some relics</p>
<p>And distribute them, at that time, on earth.</p>
<p>With special care, he will give a relic-pill</p>
<p>To the king of the Magadhans called Ajātaśatru, {53.252}</p>
<p>“And also to all the eight kings.</p>
<p>This śrāvaka, a great being</p>
<p>Of great splendor,</p>
<p>Will give everything completely to all of them. {53.253}</p>
<p>“With his mind overcome with compassion,</p>
<p>He will grieve for sentient beings</p>
<p>Who, lacking the understanding of impermanence,</p>
<p>Continue to undergo the cycle of rebirth:{53.254}</p>
<p>“ ‘Beings will weep for a long time,</p>
<p>Lasting many eons.</p>
<p>When the sacred Dharma of the Teacher, the Lion of the Śākyas,</p>
<p>Has disappeared in the world,</p>
<p>These teachings should be chanted,</p>
<p>During the terrible time of destruction.’{53.255}</p>
<p>“Then the valiant Mahākāśyapa will rise and,</p>
<p>With his mind imbued with power,</p>
<p>Will address Ajātaśatru,</p>
<p>The king of men: {53.256}</p>
<p>“ ‘To honor the Teacher’s instructions,</p>
<p>Let us go to the city of Rājagṛha.’</p>
<p>Having carefully placed the relics</p>
<p>In one hundred jars, {53.257}</p>
<p>“They will then travel eastward,</p>
<p>Hastily proceeding toward Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>After they arrive in the Bamboo Grove,</p>
<p>They will deposit there the relics of the Victorious One. {53.258}</p>
<p>“After building a marvelous stūpa</p>
<p>Of the savior, the lord of the world,</p>
<p>The great king will offer to this stūpa</p>
<p>Adornments of many kinds: {53.259}</p>
<p>“Garlands, fabrics, parasols,</p>
<p>Scented powders, perfume, incense,</p>
<p>Silks, music, riches, banners,</p>
<p>Various bells, garlands, unguents,</p>
<p>And lamps, chaplets, and wreaths,</p>
<p>Of many different kinds. {53.260}</p>
<p>“Having made these offerings,</p>
<p>The great king, his mind steeped in reverence,</p>
<p>Will bow with his head to the stūpa</p>
<p>And at that time make the following aspiration: {53.261}</p>
<p>“ ‘May I, by the abundant merit gained</p>
<p>Through worshiping the most eminent being in the world,</p>
<p>Attain the inconceivable [state whereby I will]</p>
<p>Worship many tathāgatas.’{53.262}</p>
<p>“The king will then rise</p>
<p>And speak to Mahākāśyapa,</p>
<p>Wiping teardrops off his face.</p>
<p>With his eyes dimmed by tears</p>
<p>And his heart brimming with compassion,</p>
<p>He will recall his father: {53.263}</p>
<p>“ ‘My noble friend of great wisdom,</p>
<p>Please be my confessor!</p>
<p>The evil that I have committed</p>
<p>Will cause me to fall into the Avīci hell. {53.264}</p>
<p>“ ‘Having killed my father,</p>
<p>A Dharma king established</p>
<p>On the path taught by the Teacher,</p>
<p>I am unable to distract myself.</p>
<p>My good and noble friend,</p>
<p>Be so kind as to teach me the meaning of the Dharma!’ {53.265}</p>
<p>“Thus addressed, the great being,</p>
<p>The foremost śrāvaka of the Victorious One,</p>
<p>The sagacious one called Mahākāśyapa</p>
<p>Will say the following: {53.266}</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not fear, great king!</p>
<p>You have accumulated a lot of merit.</p>
<p>In your former births</p>
<p>You have practiced virtue hundreds of times. {53.267}</p>
<p>“ ‘Once, when there was no Buddha in the world,</p>
<p>There lived a pratyeka­buddha.</p>
<p>At that time, in the city of Vārāṇasī,</p>
<p>A son was born to a prominent merchant.</p>
<p>In his ignorance and childish frivolity,</p>
<p>He went out onto the road.{53.268}</p>
<p>“ ‘He came upon</p>
<p>The blessed pratyeka­buddha,</p>
<p>Who, out of desire to benefit the world,</p>
<p>Was doing his alms rounds. {53.269}</p>
<p>“ ‘Upon seeing the pratyeka­buddha</p>
<p>The boy’s mind was filled with faith.</p>
<p>He fell at his feet and asked,</p>
<p>“What are you about to do, monk?” {53.270}</p>
<p>“ ‘The blessed, rhinoceros-like lord</p>
<p>Remained silent</p>
<p>And stood there</p>
<p>As the boy held him by the robe, [saying,] {53.271}</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Come! Come to that fine house</p>
<p>Adorned with a banner!</p>
<p>This is our dwelling.</p>
<p>You will wash your feet and have some food.</p>
<p>We shall promptly eat as much as we like,</p>
<p>And then play to our hearts’ content.” {53.272}</p>
<p>“ ‘The monk, free from faults,</p>
<p>His three stains definitively destroyed,</p>
<p>And committed to the kind treatment of others,</p>
<p>Followed the boy.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the door,</p>
<p>The glorious monk waited. {53.273}</p>
<p>“ ‘The boy entered</p>
<p>And called out, “Mother!</p>
<p>Please give some food for me,</p>
<p>And also alms of various kinds. {53.274}</p>
<p>“ ‘ “My friend has arrived here at long last,</p>
<p>Who will play with me in the sand.</p>
<p>At last, you will be pleased with him;</p>
<p>He stands waiting at the door.” {53.275}</p>
<p>“ ‘Hastily, she came out the door,</p>
<p>And immediately saw</p>
<p>The distinguished person,</p>
<p>Peaceful, and of great majesty. {53.276}</p>
<p>“ ‘She then quickly went in,</p>
<p>Took a fine vessel,</p>
<p>Cleaned it with her hands,</p>
<p>And prepared some flowers and incense.{53.277}</p>
<p>“ ‘She took some pure rice pudding</p>
<p>Flavored with many spices,</p>
<p>And also different other foodstuffs,</p>
<p>And arranged them on a silver plate. {53.278}</p>
<p>“ ‘She then promptly returned [to the door]</p>
<p>And placed [the articles] in the monk’s bowl.</p>
<p>Then she, fond of the Dharma like her son,</p>
<p>Fell down at the monk’s feet.{53.279}</p>
<p>“ ‘The monk accepted the alms</p>
<p>And flew up into the sky,</p>
<p>Where he could be seen</p>
<p>As a row of lights. {53.280}</p>
<p>“ ‘The rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>Do not teach the Dharma verbally.</p>
<p>These great beings present it to others</p>
<p>Through their magical powers. {53.281}</p>
<p>“ ‘They are exceedingly compassionate</p>
<p>Toward beings and free from selfishness.</p>
<p>They reveal their supernatural power</p>
<p>To beings with respect to future lives. {53.282}</p>
<p>“ ‘By the ripening of this karma,</p>
<p>The boy along with the mother</p>
<p>Attained the state of a celestial being</p>
<p>For five hundred births. {53.283}</p>
<p>“ ‘He became a king of gods,</p>
<p>And she his mother.</p>
<p>Then he became a human-born king,</p>
<p>Ruling over an empire of men. {53.284}</p>
<p>“ ‘Having enjoyed pleasures for a long time,</p>
<p>He was born, in this world, as the son of Bimbisāra,</p>
<p>The same one who had grabbed the blessed [monk]</p>
<p>By the robe and pulled him. {53.285}</p>
<p>“ ‘You, however, spoke improper words</p>
<p>When addressing a monk,</p>
<p>Saying, at that time,</p>
<p>“Be my playmate in the sand.”{53.286}</p>
<p>“ ‘Based on the past karma of those words,</p>
<p>Undesirable and rude,</p>
<p>You experienced, for a long time,</p>
<p>An intense and acute suffering,</p>
<p>Falling, against your wishes, into the terrible hell</p>
<p>Where the pain is difficult to bear. {53.287}</p>
<p>“ ‘Ensnared thus in the trammels of karma,</p>
<p>Beings follow painful destinies.</p>
<p>One creates karma laughing,</p>
<p>But experiences it crying. {53.288}</p>
<p>“ ‘Because of your former childish attitude</p>
<p>Toward a savior, a pratyeka­buddha,</p>
<p>You spoke improper words,</p>

<p>“ ‘Having left the hell realm,</p>
<p>You became human and arrived here,</p>

<p>Was still in a hell born of karmic ripening. {53.290}</p>
<p>“ ‘Because of this and your violent anger,</p>
<p>You were predisposed to kill your father.</p>
<p>Similarly, because of a pre-existing karmic trait</p>
<p>Created by serving a pratyeka­buddha,</p>
<p>You met the Buddha in person</p>
<p>And you worshiped him. {53.291}</p>
<p>“ ‘By the same cause of [serving a pratyeka­buddha],</p>
<p>You have obtained a kingdom in this [world].’</p>
<p>Thus will the two of them converse</p>
<p>In the Bamboo Grove on earth. {53.292}</p>
<p>“The first one, my foremost disciple,</p>
<p>And the second one, the king,</p>

<p>And then go each to his own home. {53.293}</p>
<p>“My foremost disciple,</p>

<p>The Dharma that I have taught,</p>
<p>And that which was formerly taught by other victors. {53.295}</p>
<p>“The doctrine will be presented</p>
<p>By the foremost disciple as threefold,</p>
<p>With its scriptures divided into</p>
<p>Sūtra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma. {53.296}</p>
<p>“The wise [Mahākāśyapa] will release beings</p>
<p>From the three fetters, dry up their three faults,</p>
<p>Free them from the three sufferings,</p>

<p>“The sagacious one will thus</p>
<p>Further the cause of the buddhas’ teachings.</p>

<p>The great monarch Ajātaśatru, {53.298}</p>
<p>“He will extend his rule over the entirety of Magadha and Aṅga,</p>
<p>After that over Vārāṇasī,</p>

<p>After being instructed by you, divine youth.{53.300}</p>
<p>“His son, the king known</p>
<p>By the initial U,</p>
<p>Will also become, before long,</p>
<p>Actively engaged in promoting the teachings. {53.301}</p>

<p>Committed to writing in their entirety.</p>
<p>After worshiping [the volumes] with many offerings,</p>
<p>He will distribute them throughout the quarters. {53.302}</p>
<p>“Later he will not suffer a low rebirth,</p>

<p>After twenty or thirty years</p>
<p>Spent among the pitṛs. {53.303}</p>
<p>“His earthly existence</p>
<p>Will end at midnight,</p>

<p>“For twenty-six days</p>
<p>He will suffer the pain of this terrible disease.</p>
<p>Affected by all manner of illnesses,</p>
<p>He will be incapacitated in different ways. {53.305}</p>
<p>“He will thus pass away</p>
<p>And swiftly be reborn among the gods.</p>
<p>With effort and care, in due course,</p>
<p>He will certainly attain realization. {53.306}</p>
<p>“These and many other kings,</p>
<p>Those in the past and the future,</p>
<p>Having done various services</p>
<p>For the pratyeka­buddhas and the victorious saviors, {53.307}</p>
<p>“Obtain the wished-for extraordinary fortunes,</p>
<p>Whether divine or human,</p>

<p>The blessed state free from decay. {53.308}</p>
<p>“Kings can be of three categories,</p>
<p>Higher, middling, or inferior.</p>
<p>The kings said [to have ruled] in the first eon</p>
<p>Are those of the Nahuṣa and Pārthiva lines. {53.309}</p>
<p>“Budha, Śukra, and Udaya were kings</p>
<p>Who were definitely mantra adepts.</p>
<p>There were also Śāntanu, Citra, and Sucitra</p>
<p>And the kings of the Paṇḍu dynasty.{53.310}</p>
<p>“The dynasties of Vārati and Yātu</p>
<p>Died out because of a ṛṣi’s curse.</p>
<p>There were also, in former times,</p>
<p>Kārtika, Kārtavīrya, Daśaratha, and Dāśarathi. {53.311}</p>
<p>“There was Arjuna, accomplished in mantras,</p>
<p>And Aśvatthāman, a peerless minister,</p>
<p>Who was the only son of the twice-born Droṇa</p>
<p>And an accomplished master of mantras.{53.312}</p>
<p>“Using mantra-empowered weapons,</p>
<p>He became the ruler of an earthly realm</p>
<p>Extending over the entire three islands</p>
<p>Of Jambūdvīpa. {53.313}</p>

<p>And rejoicing in the worship of the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>Proceed to the higher realms. {53.314}</p>

<p>While others pursue the pratyeka­buddha path.</p>
<p>Some are destined to become śrāvakas.</p>

<p>“As for their lifespans,</p>
<p>They are divided into [three] categories.</p>
<p>The superior ones have long lifespans,</p>
<p>The middling have middling ones, {53.316}</p>
<p>“But in the final eon,</p>
<p>The wretched and debased age of strife,</p>
<p>The kings will have short lifespans</p>
<p>And be fond of discord.{53.317}</p>
<p>“They will be given to mutual enmity</p>
<p>And inflicting harm on one another.</p>
<p>They will be of inferior birth</p>
<p>And will provoke armed conflicts.{53.318}</p>
<p>“At that time, they will be eager to use weapons</p>
<p>And will take pleasure in [seducing] others’ wives.</p>

<p>Reviled by the world. {53.319}</p>
<p>“They will be wicked, vulgar, and selfish,</p>
<p>And will engage in evil acts.</p>

<p>Mahendra, and Candrasama. {53.323}</p>
<p>“Siṃha of the Licchavi clan</p>

<p>Vidyota, Pradyota, and Mahāsena. {53.324}</p>
<p>“In Ujjain there is Caṇḍa.</p>
<p>In the city of Kapilavastu</p>
<p>There is the king Śuddhodana</p>
<p>And the powerful Vairāṭa.{53.325}</p>
<p>“These kings are said to be kṣatriyas</p>
<p>And worshipers of the Teacher.</p>

<p>In his [present existence] as the Lion of the Śākyas. {53.326}</p>
<p>“Having heard the Dharma,</p>
<p>They will obtain lasting good fortune,</p>

<p>“One of them will worship your teachings,</p>
<p>Which I have given on earth.</p>
<p>He was predicted by you,</p>
<p>Divine youth beautiful as a child,</p>
<p>As the one called Ajātaśatru,</p>
<p>Who will dedicate himself to the goal of awakening. {53.329}</p>
<p>“One hundred years after</p>
<p>My parinirvāṇa on earth,</p>
<p>When there is no light or joy</p>
<p>And the darkness of ignorance descends,</p>
<p>When the earth is empty</p>
<p>Without the Victorious One, {53.330}</p>
<p>“At that terrible time,</p>
<p>In the city called Kusumapura,</p>
<p>There will be a king who rules that land,</p>
<p>Known by the name Aśoka.</p>
<p>He will be severe in his actions,</p>
<p>Tempestuous, and pitiless. {53.331}</p>
<p>“He will, however, meet a virtuous friend</p>
<p>Who is free from desire and dignified,</p>
<p>A monk endowed with discipline</p>
<p>Whose mind is free from the fever [of afflictions].{53.332}</p>
<p>“Because of the karmic predisposition from the past</p>
<p>Formed through a gift of dust to the dignified [Sage],</p>
<p>This king will be destined</p>
<p>To own vast land and great wealth.</p>
<p>He will also understand what is right and what is wrong,</p>
<p>And he will become gentle and compassionate. {53.333}</p>
<p>“Revealing the underlying cause,</p>
<p>The monk, free from desire and very dignified,</p>
<p>Will say, ‘You, O king, in a former life,</p>
<p>Acting innocently with childlike flightiness, {53.334}</p>
<p>“ ‘Presented at that time, with folded hands,</p>
<p>Some dust to the victorious Lion of the Śākyas,</p>
<p>Placing it in his bowl as food.</p>
<p>Because of this, you attained a divine state, {53.335}</p>
<p>“ ‘And then, having departed from the celestial realm,</p>
<p>You took birth here, in the world of your ancestors.</p>
<p>Enjoy the dominion, O king,</p>
<p>Over Jambūdvīpa with its pleasant groves!’ {53.336}</p>
<p>“The great king will practice</p>
<p>The mantra of the great yakṣa Jambhala.</p>
<p>After he becomes accomplished,</p>
<p>He will obtain a chariot drawn by spirits.{53.337}</p>
<p>“He will be attended upon by the yakṣas,</p>
<p>Who anticipate his orders.</p>
<p>The nāgas will attend upon him too,</p>
<p>Duly awaiting his orders. {53.338}</p>
<p>“Devoted to the Dharma, Aśoka will attain great majesty,</p>
<p>And he will exercise the powers of a sovereign,</p>
<p>Traveling wherever he pleases</p>
<p>Without ever being obstructed. {53.339}</p>
<p>“He will take, at that time, from the city of Rājagṛha,</p>
<p>From the grove called the Bamboo Grove,</p>
<p>The finest relics of the victorious ones on earth,</p>
<p>Which had been placed there in earlier times. {53.340}</p>
<p>“With his mind steeped in virtue,</p>
<p>He will take the relics from their container</p>
<p>And then worship the stūpa,</p>
<p>Just as was done in the past. {53.341}</p>
<p>“He will take out the jar containing the relics and,</p>
<p>Having divided them into one hundred parts,</p>
<p>That wise one will immediately command</p>
<p>The yakṣas as follows: {53.342}</p>
<p>“ ‘Gentlemen, please adorn</p>
<p>The entirety of Jambūdvīpa with stūpas.</p>
<p>You must make the earth</p>
<p>Into a receptacle of relics.’{53.343}</p>
<p>“Having received their orders,</p>
<p>The yakṣas, carefully at midnight,</p>
<p>Using for this task nonhuman labor,</p>
<p>Will erect stone pillars throughout the land. {53.344}</p>
<p>“They will erect, at that time,</p>
<p>Many thousands of pillars</p>
<p>Serving as signposts for living beings</p>
<p>For their worship of the caityas. {53.345}</p>
<p>“Having thus constructed various stūpas</p>
<p>Dedicated to the lord protectors of the world,</p>
<p>The yakṣas will instantly return</p>
<p>To the side of the king, [Aśoka]. {53.346}</p>
<p>“Bowing their heads to him,</p>
<p>The guhyakas will say,</p>
<p>‘We have done everything exactly as instructed.</p>
<p>Will you not have a look, O lord?’ {53.347}</p>
<p>“The king will then quickly</p>
<p>Mount his chariot,</p>
<p>Taking with him various things to offer</p>
<p>And adornments of many kinds. {53.348}</p>
<p>“He will thus quickly fill</p>
<p>The spirit-drawn chariot</p>
<p>With gold, silver, copper,</p>
<p>And various adornments for the stūpas. {53.349}</p>
<p>“Within a moment, the king</p>
<p>Will worship the victorious ones</p>
<p>With manifold articles</p>
<p>At the locations where their reliquaries will be. {53.350}</p>
<p>“At that time, when all the land has been adorned</p>
<p>With the relics of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>The king, the righteous and noble Aśoka,</p>
<p>Will make the following aspiration:</p>
<p>‘By the power of this merit</p>
<p>May I become a supreme buddha.’ {53.351}</p>
<p>“Remembering this,</p>
<p>The noble, righteous king Aśoka</p>
<p>Will become a god after he dies,</p>
<p>Steadily progressing toward awakening. {53.352}</p>
<p>“On earth, he will worship</p>
<p>The supreme relics for eighty-seven years.</p>
<p>He will live for one hundred and fifty years,</p>
<p>During which he will rid his kingdom of troubles. {53.353}</p>
<p>“Because of the maturing of his past karma,</p>
<p>He will develop a physical illness.</p>
<p>Afflicted by it, he will suffer pain,</p>
<p>But when he dies, he will go to heaven. {53.354}</p>
<p>“He will obtain and enjoy</p>
<p>A great fortune of the gods,</p>
<p>And in due course, being intelligent,</p>
<p>Will attain the realization that is so hard to find. {53.355}</p>
<p>“The mantras effective at that time</p>
<p>Will be those of the Vajra and Lotus families,</p>
<p>Those of Jambhala and other yakṣas</p>
<p>Who follow the same teachings,</p>
<p>And also those of the yakṣiṇīs,</p>
<p>Such as the powerful Hārītī and so forth. {53.356}</p>
<p>“The cakravartin mantras that emanate</p>
<p>From Cakravartin will be effective too—</p>
<p>The powerful vidyārāja mantras,</p>
<p>Starting from the uṣṇīṣas and including</p>
<p>All the other mantras</p>
<p>Taught by the victors. {53.357}</p>
<p>“The sādhanas to be performed at that auspicious time</p>
<p>Are those of the supreme type.</p>
<p>They cannot be accomplished by inferior practitioners,</p>
<p>But only by the supreme ones who pursue the highest destiny,</p>
<p>Such as Dilīpa, Nahuṣa,</p>
<p>Māndhātṛ, and Sagara. {53.358}</p>
<p>“They accomplished the cakravartin mantras</p>
<p>Taught by the victorious ones.</p>
<p>Noble Nahuṣa accomplished</p>
<p>The mantra of Tejorāśi.{53.359}</p>
<p>“King Sagara accomplished</p>
<p>The mantra of Sitātapatra.</p>
<p>King Dilīpa accomplished</p>
<p>The One Syllable mantra.{53.360}</p>
<p>“Māndhātṛ accomplished, in this world,</p>
<p>The mantra of Unnatoṣṇīṣa.</p>
<p>The supreme king Dhundhumāra</p>
<p>Accomplished the mantra of Jayoṣṇīṣa. {53.361}</p>
<p>“King Kandarpa is said to have accomplished</p>
<p>The mantra of Vijayoṣṇīṣa.</p>
<p>His son Prajāpati, too,</p>
<p>Accomplished the Locanā mantra on earth. {53.362}</p>
<p>“Prajāpati’s son Nābhi</p>
<p>Accomplished the mantra of Ūrṇa.</p>
<p>Ṛṣabha, a son of Nābhi,</p>
<p>Was successful in his endeavors and strict in his observances. {53.363}</p>
<p>“He accomplished the mantra of the yakṣa Māṇicara</p>
<p>In the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Bharata, a son of Ṛṣabha,</p>
<p>Also recited the mantras at that time,</p>
<p>And in due course accomplished</p>
<p>The Great Hero mantra on earth. {53.364}</p>
<p>“These and many other kings,</p>
<p>Renowned throughout the world,</p>
<p>After accomplishing their mantras,</p>
<p>Ruled their kingdoms and then ascended to heaven. {53.365}</p>
<p>“The powerful vidyārājas</p>
<p>That were taught by the victorious lords</p>
<p>Could all be accomplished</p>
<p>During the auspicious time of the eon</p>
<p>When the lifespan was eighty thousand years,</p>
<p>By those who knew the value of the mantra method. {53.366}</p>
<p>“These and many other kings,</p>
<p>Renowned throughout the world,</p>
<p>Ruled their kingdoms</p>
<p>For eighty thousand or one hundred thousand years</p>
<p>And then ascended to heaven,</p>
<p>Steadily progressing toward awakening. {53.367}</p>
<p>“Then, during the middle period,</p>
<p>The mantras that brought success</p>
<p>Were those belonging to the family of the lotus holder;</p>
<p>They possessed great divine and magical powers</p>
<p>And were employed by the prominent ministers</p>
<p>And the kings who ruled over all the land.{53.368}</p>
<p>“Thus, the king Brahmadatta,</p>
<p>In the great city of Vārāṇasī,</p>
<p>Accomplished [the mantra of] the lotus holder</p>
<p>Known in the world as Lokeśa. {53.369}</p>
<p>“He was valiant, magnanimous,</p>
<p>And distinguished by his great compassion.</p>
<p>He instructed beings in the Dharma,</p>
<p>Assuming the form of his mantra deity.{53.370}</p>
<p>“King Brahmadatta experienced happiness</p>
<p>While a human being.</p>
<p>Then he, the master of the mantra,</p>
<p>Ascended to heaven in his physical body. {53.371}</p>
<p>“His son, who was intelligent,</p>
<p>Virtuous in his actions, and strict in his observances,</p>
<p>Accomplished for his part the mantra</p>
<p>Of the great hero known as Hayagrīva. {53.372}</p>
<p>“With the power of this mantra</p>
<p>He defeated Śakra during that time.</p>
<p>His son, named Śveta, was a king</p>
<p>Who gave away everything he had. {53.373}</p>
<p>“His mantra deity who grants boons</p>
<p>Was the one called Mahāśvetā.</p>
<p>Having accomplished her mantra,</p>
<p>Śveta lived three hundred years. {53.374}</p>
<p>“By the power of this mantra</p>
<p>He went to the realm of Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>He is destined to attain awakening,</p>
<p>Just like the others I have prophesied. {53.375}</p>
<p>“The mantras that would have been accomplished</p>
<p>During the middle period are the middling mantras.</p>
<p>The mantras that will be effective</p>
<p>During the wretched and debased eon,</p>
<p>When I have passed into the final nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Are the mantras of the Vajra and Lotus families. {53.376}</p>
<p>“The mantras that you, divine youth,</p>
<p>Have formerly taught on earth</p>
<p>Will also be effective and will constitute</p>
<p>The cause of good fortune. {53.377}</p>
<p>“So too is the case with other mantras</p>
<p>Used for different worldly purposes,</p>
<p>Such as the mantras of kaśmalas and other deformed beings</p>
<p>Who course in mid-regions and in the sky; {53.378}</p>
<p>“Or the mantras of the yakṣiṇīs who roam the earth</p>
<p>And of the various piśācīs;</p>
<p>And likewise the mantras of the garuḍas and the kinnaras</p>
<p>And those taught to be of the rākṣasas and the pretas. {53.379}</p>
<p>“So, too, the powerful mantras of the nāginīs,</p>
<p>Who protect against the piśācas and uragas,</p>
<p>Will be effective</p>
<p>During the wretched, debased eon.{53.380}</p>
<p>“The mantras [of deities] with the forms</p>
<p>Of kumāras or kumārīs</p>
<p>Will also be effective</p>
<p>At that terrible time. {53.381}</p>
<p>“The mantras are thus of three kinds,</p>
<p>And so are the sādhanas.</p>
<p>The accomplishment can also be of three types,</p>
<p>Corresponding to the threefold division of time periods.</p>
<p>I present what would be an elaborate explanation</p>
<p>In a condensed manner. {53.382}</p>
<p>“After the first king Aśoka</p>
<p>There will come a king</p>
<p>Known as Viśoka,</p>
<p>A follower of Dharma in the world. {53.383}</p>
<p>“He will accomplish the mantra</p>
<p>Of the goddess Pāṇḍaravāsinī.</p>
<p>With this accomplishment,</p>
<p>Viśoka will ascend to the celestial realm. {53.384}</p>
<p>“This great king, having enjoyed happiness</p>
<p>In the celestial abode for a long time,</p>
<p>Will again resume his life as a human,</p>
<p>Disciplined in the Dharma and wise. {53.385}</p>
<p>“He, the splendorous one, will enjoy his kingship</p>
<p>Blessed with many boons.</p>
<p>He will worship the supreme relics</p>
<p>For seventy-six years.</p>
<p>Then, overcome with fever,</p>
<p>His body will give out and he will go to heaven. {53.386}</p>
<p>“Directly after him, there will be</p>
<p>A king known as Śūrasena,</p>
<p>A celebrated practitioner of the Dharma</p>
<p>Always applying himself to the teachings. {53.387}</p>
<p>“For his part, he will accomplish the mantra</p>
<p>Of the goddess Stūpamahāśriyā.</p>
<p>He will commission great works</p>
<p>In the Teacher’s honor,</p>
<p>And the entire land, as far as the ocean shore,</p>
<p>Will be adorned with stūpas. {53.388}</p>
<p>“Then, having developed a physical illness</p>
<p>Due to the ripening of his past karma,</p>
<p>He will deteriorate and pass away</p>
<p>Within one fortnight. {53.389}</p>
<p>“Having ruled the realm</p>
<p>For seventeen human years,</p>
<p>When he dies he will enter the celestial realm,</p>
<p>Steadily progressing toward awakening. {53.390}</p>
<p>“Directly after him there will be</p>
<p>Another king, Nanda by name.</p>
<p>He, the glorious, will reside in the Flower City</p>
<p>With his powerful army. {53.391}</p>
<p>“For his part, he will accomplish</p>
<p>The mantra of the piśāca named Pīlu.</p>
<p>Through the power of this mantra</p>
<p>He will enjoy great comforts. {53.392}</p>
<p>“He will become known in this world</p>
<p>As the ‘chief rogue,’</p>
<p>Who first got rich as a minister</p>
<p>And then went on to become a king. {53.393}</p>
<p>“At that time, there will live on earth,</p>
<p>In the capital city of Magadha,</p>
<p>Greedy brahmin logicians</p>
<p>Proud of their magical abilities.</p>
<p>They will be full of vain pride and arrogance,</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt. {53.394}</p>
<p>“The king, surrounded by them,</p>
<p>Will bestow upon them great wealth.</p>
<p>Although disciplined in and devoted to the Dharma,</p>
<p>The king will give his wealth to them.</p>
<p>Later, having met a virtuous friend,</p>
<p>He will make offerings to the supreme relics.{53.395}</p>
<p>“Solely because of his habitual practice</p>
<p>And the constancy of his generosity,</p>
<p>This wise [king] will construct monasteries</p>
<p>Over a period of sixty-eight years. {53.396}</p>
<p>“There will be, at that time,</p>
<p>In the city named after flowers,</p>
<p>A great chief minister</p>
<p>Who is a good and compassionate brahmin. {53.397}</p>
<p>“He will become the embodiment of the Dharma</p>
<p>For that outstanding king.</p>
<p>He will accomplish on earth</p>
<p>The mantra of the yakṣiṇī Vīramatī. {53.398}</p>
<p>“He also will commission the finest reliquary</p>
<p>Of the victorious ones on earth.</p>
<p>Due to the power of the yakṣiṇī,</p>
<p>He will become exceedingly wise. {53.399}</p>
<p>“Impelled by his earlier habits</p>
<p>And because of his karmic traits,</p>
<p>This wise minister will attain, in due course,</p>
<p>The awakening that is so difficult to obtain. {53.400}</p>
<p>“At that time, some brahmin youths will die</p>
<p>Due to their indulgence in vice.</p>
<p>Also at that time he, known by the name of Vararuci,</p>
<p>Will succumb to excessive sexual passion.{53.401}</p>
<p>“The glorious king Nanda,</p>
<p>Because of the karma of his earlier transgressions,</p>
<p>Will displease his ministers</p>
<p>In the city called Pāṭaliputra.{53.402}</p>
<p>“Although his ministers will be disaffected,</p>
<p>He will remain true to his promises and powerful.</p>
<p>However, due to the karma of former transgressions,</p>
<p>He will develop a severe illness. {53.403}</p>
<p>“Suffering from high fever,</p>
<p>He will die at midnight.</p>
<p>The life of this king</p>
<p>Will be sixty-six years long.</p>
<p>He will be destined to become a śrāvaka</p>
<p>And attain awakening. {53.404}</p>
<p>“Another friend of [King Nanda]</p>
<p>Will be a young brahmin named Pāṇini,</p>
<p>Prophesied by me</p>
<p>To become a śrāvaka. {53.405}</p>
<p>“He will accomplish</p>
<p>The mantra of the noble Lokīśa.</p>
<p>Desiring wisdom, this brahmin</p>
<p>Will accomplish the mantra of the krodha Hālāhala. {53.406}</p>
<p>“Next in succession after [King Nanda]</p>
<p>Will be the one known as Candragupta.</p>
<p>He will accomplish the mantra of the yakṣa Jalendra</p>
<p>And will rid his kingdom of troubles. {53.407}</p>
<p>“This great king will enjoy great comforts</p>
<p>And will be true to his promises and dedicated to the Dharma.</p>
<p>Having, however, met a nonvirtuous friend</p>
<p>He will kill many beings.</p>
<p>Because of the ripening of this karma,</p>
<p>He will become debilitated by poisonous skin eruptions. {53.408}</p>
<p>“Lamenting, at midnight he will appoint</p>
<p>As his successor on earth his son,</p>
<p>Bindusāra by name, still a child,</p>
<p>Along with a wicked minister.{53.409}</p>
<p>“After Candragupta’s time on earth is over,</p>
<p>He will pass away</p>
<p>And go to the realm of the pretas,</p>
<p>Following a nonhuman destiny.</p>
<p>But then, because of his mantra practice,</p>
<p>He will leave that realm and go to heaven. {53.410}</p>
<p>“Because of the mantra,</p>
<p>His mind will be steeped in virtue,</p>
<p>And the king will attain in due course</p>
<p>The realization of a pratyeka­buddha.{53.411}</p>
<p>“In his former life as Siṃhadatta,</p>
<p>King Bindusāra</p>
<p>Built a caitya as a child,</p>
<p>With his mind still undeveloped. {53.412}</p>
<p>“Through the power of this karma,</p>
<p>The virtuous [Siṃhadatta] went to heaven</p>
<p>And enjoyed pleasures among the gods</p>
<p>For five hundred thousand lives. {53.413}</p>
<p>“Having departed the celestial realm,</p>
<p>He will be become an earthly king</p>
<p>Born in the royal family</p>
<p>Of the sagacious Candragupta.{53.414}</p>
<p>“A mere child, the king</p>
<p>Will experience great pleasures,</p>
<p>And when grown up, he will turn bold,</p>
<p>Resolute, and smooth spoken.</p>
<p>He will keep the kingdom</p>
<p>Under his control for seventy years. {53.415}</p>
<p>“This king will accomplish</p>
<p>The mantra of Keśinī.</p>
<p>At that time, divine youth,</p>
<p>Your mantras will bring success.{53.416}</p>
<p>“The mantras that you taught</p>
<p>Will be accomplished at that time.</p>
<p>The inner essence of every being is that of the divine youth,</p>
<p>Who exercises his power over the worlds.{53.417}</p>
<p>“He will manifest for beings</p>
<p>In the form of the mantra without a doubt.</p>
<p>The mantras that you have taught</p>
<p>Out of the desire to help beings</p>
<p>Will be recited on earth at that time</p>
<p>And will always bring accomplishment. {53.418}</p>
<p>“The sagacious King Bindusāra</p>
<p>Will have a minister,</p>
<p>Cāṇakya by name, a brahmin youth</p>
<p>Who will accomplish the mantra of a krodha.</p>
<p>This evil-minded man will accomplish</p>
<p>The mantra of the krodha Yamāntaka. {53.419}</p>
<p>“Overcome by anger,</p>
<p>He will kill living beings</p>
<p>And will commit terrible evil</p>
<p>Over the period of the three reigns.{53.420}</p>
<p>“This corrupt brahmin</p>
<p>Will live for a long time and,</p>
<p>Through the power of the mantra,</p>
<p>Will carnally enjoy an asurī. {53.421}</p>
<p>“Taking on the body of an asura,</p>
<p>He will live for a long time.</p>
<p>When his body gives out,</p>
<p>He will fall into the hell realm.{53.422}</p>
<p>“There, the evil-minded [Cāṇakya]</p>
<p>Will experience the sufferings of hell.</p>
<p>His bad karma will bring upon him</p>
<p>The sufferings of different hells. {53.423}</p>
<p>“Having passed there one eon, he will be aroused</p>
<p>From that state by the mantra of the Krodha.</p>
<p>After passing away from hell,</p>
<p>He will be reborn as an animal. {53.424}</p>
<p>“Born as a nāga,</p>
<p>He will have the frightening form</p>
<p>Of a nāga king, very wrathful,</p>
<p>With a big hood, and proud of his venom. {53.425}</p>
<p>“He will commit terrible acts,</p>
<p>And when he dies, with his bad karma</p>
<p>He will be reborn in the realm of Yama.{53.426}</p>
<p>“Having become the king Yama,</p>
<p>The powerful king of the pretas,</p>
<p>He will endure thousands of sufferings</p>
<p>Again and again. {53.427}</p>
<p>“In due course, he will be reborn on earth</p>
<p>As a dull-witted brahmin youth.</p>
<p>Having obtained a human birth,</p>
<p>He will have a frightening form.</p>
<p>Destitute and short-tempered,</p>
<p>He will have few friends. {53.428}</p>
<p>“The pratyeka­buddhas, who have no desires in this world</p>
<p>And live alone like rhinoceroses,</p>
<p>Wander the earth filled with compassion</p>
<p>For those who are forsaken and miserable.</p>
<p>They take up the life of mendicancy</p>
<p>Out of the desire to help sentient beings. {53.429}</p>
<p>“Seeing the bad [state of Cāṇakya’s] mind,</p>
<p>And being able to read the thoughts of others,</p>
<p>They will approach him,</p>
<p>Solely out of compassion. {53.430}</p>
<p>“Cāṇakya, having obtained</p>
<p>Some inferior gruel in order to eat it,</p>
<p>Will be swayed by the power of the Krodha’s mantra</p>
<p>And create, at that time, a good cause. {53.431}</p>
<p>“He will offer the gruel to them as alms</p>
<p>With a singularly magnanimous mind and say,</p>
<p>‘Excuse me, all of you renunciants!</p>
<p>Eat this food, as much as you like.’</p>
<p>Right then, out of their sympathy for him,</p>
<p>The pratyeka­buddhas will display their miraculous power. {53.432}</p>
<p>“Stricken with wonder,</p>
<p>His mind uplifted by their power,</p>
<p>He will prostrate himself headlong</p>
<p>To the rhinoceros-like pratyeka­buddhas.</p>
<p>And they all, free from faults,</p>
<p>Will fly into the sky as they please.{53.433}</p>
<p>“Cāṇakya will then, with a good intention,</p>
<p>Make an aspiration for the realization of a pratyeka­buddha:</p>
<p>‘May I become the way</p>
<p>These magnificent beings are,</p>
<p>Steeped in tranquility and endowed with magical powers.</p>
<p>May I be free from suffering and unhappy rebirths.’{53.434}</p>
<p>“When he dies after exhausting his remaining karma,</p>
<p>He will, inevitably, be reborn in heaven.</p>
<p>In due course he will fully assimilate the Dharma</p>
<p>And attain the realization of a pratyeka­buddha.</p>
<p>From this [one should draw the conclusion]</p>
<p>That mantras should not be used in the sādhanas of assault. {53.435}</p>
<p>“Such violent practices are forbidden</p>
<p>By the buddhas and the bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>The exceedingly compassionate buddhas</p>
<p>And the majestic bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Taught the implications of the power of mantras</p>
<p>For all the practitioners of rites. {53.436}</p>
<p>“The mantras taught by the tathāgatas</p>
<p>Are wish-fulfilling gems.</p>
<p>However, beings who are by nature immature,</p>
<p>Confused, and under the sway of anger and greed</p>
<p>Employ these mantras against each other</p>
<p>In the violent rites of assault. {53.437}</p>
<p>“Such rites are forbidden by the buddhas</p>
<p>And the sagacious bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Since the mantras are meant to increase</p>
<p>Beings’ well-being in every possible way. {53.438}</p>
<p>“The mantras raise kingdoms,</p>
<p>Provide protection, and bring wealth.</p>
<p>They can summon beings</p>
<p>Of different types of birth.</p>
<p>The mantras should never be mastered</p>
<p>In order to destroy life. {53.439}</p>
<p>“At that time my monks</p>
<p>Will be very learned.</p>
<p>One by the name of Mātṛceṭa</p>
<p>Will compose a hymn of praise for me</p>
<p>That will be recited, whenever appropriate,</p>
<p>By those who exemplify good qualities.{53.440}</p>
<p>“Having developed complete faith,</p>
<p>He will delight in the teachings of the buddhas.</p>
<p>A mantra adept, himself inconspicuous,</p>
<p>He will only proclaim praises of Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>He will be a learned proponent of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Endowed with good qualities and discipline. {53.441}</p>
<p>“When he was an animal in a past life,</p>
<p>He recited the same hymn of praise</p>
<p>In the fine city called ‘the King’s,’</p>
<p>In the park called ‘the Grove,’</p>
<p>Where I used to spend my time as I pleased,</p>
<p>Together with my disciples. {53.442}</p>
<p>“Living there as a crow,</p>
<p>He developed faith in me.</p>
<p>He died with thoughts of trust in me</p>
<p>And was reborn in heaven. {53.443}</p>
<p>“When his life as a god ends,</p>
<p>He will be reborn among humans.</p>
<p>Living among them, he will renounce the world</p>
<p>For the sake of my doctrine. {53.444}</p>
<p>“Having thus become a renunciant,</p>
<p>That great being will praise me,</p>
<p>Becoming known, at that time,</p>
<p>As Mātṛceṭa who keeps his observances.{53.445}</p>
<p>“For the benefit of all beings,</p>
<p>He will compose, as necessary,</p>
<p>Religious hymns in fine language</p>
<p>With examples and allegories.{53.446}</p>
<p>“Out of his kindness for sentient beings,</p>
<p>He will dedicate himself to writing inspiring hymns.</p>
<p>He will live during the final eon</p>
<p>That is reviled by the world.</p>
<p>When his body gives out,</p>
<p>He will go to heaven due to his ripened karma. {53.447}</p>
<p>“Having experienced various delights,</p>
<p>The wise Mātṛceṭa will, in due course,</p>
<p>Attain the omniscient awakening—</p>
<p>The inconceivable absolute truth. {53.448}</p>
<p>“When four hundred years</p>
<p>Have passed after my parinirvāṇa,</p>
<p>A monk by the name of Nāgārjuna</p>
<p>Will delight in this beneficial teaching.</p>
<p>He will attain the Joyful stage,</p>
<p>And will live six hundred years. {53.449}</p>
<p>“This great person will accomplish</p>
<p>The vidyā called Māyūrī.</p>
<p>He will know the meaning of various treatises down to every word</p>
<p>And will understand that in reality there is no independent existence. {53.450}</p>
<p>“When he leaves his body,</p>
<p>He will be reborn in Sukhāvatī</p>
<p>And in due course</p>
<p>Will certainly attain buddhahood. {53.451}</p>
<p>“Then there will be a monk by the name of Asaṅga</p>
<p>Who will understand the true meaning of the treatises.</p>
<p>He will clearly discern many times over</p>
<p>The direct and indirect meaning of the sūtras. {53.452}</p>
<p>“He will educate people,</p>
<p>Dedicated to the task and well disciplined.</p>
<p>He will accomplish</p>
<p>The vidyā called Śāladūtī. {53.453}</p>
<p>“With his superior intellect</p>
<p>Developed by the power of the vidyā mantra,</p>
<p>He will distill the true meaning from the sūtras,</p>
<p>Ensuring a long survival of the teachings.</p>
<p>He will live one hundred and fifty years,</p>
<p>And when he leaves his body he will be reborn in heaven. {53.454}</p>
<p>“During his lengthy peregrination through saṃsāra,</p>
<p>He will experience happiness for a long time,</p>
<p>And in due course this great being</p>
<p>Will attain awakening. {53.455}</p>
<p>“There will thus be during that period</p>
<p>Many different types of monks who follow my teachings,</p>
<p>Including those who possess insight</p>
<p>And are disciplined in the Dharma. {53.456}</p>
<p>“There will also come, in the final period,</p>
<p>A very learned person called Nanda.</p>
<p>Conversant with the tantras</p>
<p>And wholly dedicated to the quest of mantras,</p>
<p>He will accomplish the pot of fortune</p>
<p>That is activated with the mantra of the yakṣa.{53.457}</p>
<p>“Accomplished in austerities,</p>
<p>He will draw forth from the pot</p>
<p>An important Mahāyāna sūtra</p>
<p>That I taught in the past.{53.458}</p>
<p>“Reading the volume continually</p>
<p>As its nature is that of the mantra,</p>
<p>He will not guard the pot</p>
<p>That was obtained through the yakṣa. {53.459}</p>
<p>“Due to his carelessness and lack of attention,</p>
<p>The pot will be stolen by Mūrdhaṭaka.</p>
<p>The monk [Nanda] who has mastered the mantra</p>
<p>Will start reciting it. {53.460}</p>
<p>“He will search for the pot,</p>
<p>But will not find it anywhere.</p>
<p>Then, his flesh turning red from anger,</p>
<p>He will declare in a resounding voice, {53.461}</p>
<p>“ ‘From Brahmā down to the lowest being,</p>
<p>Śakra and the others, including Maheśvara,</p>
<p>[Everybody] can be summoned by the mantra.</p>
<p>If not, I am neither a follower nor a master of mantra.{53.462}</p>
<p>“ ‘The mantras taught by the Buddha’s heirs</p>
<p>And by the supreme victors</p>
<p>Are for restraining</p>
<p>Those difficult to tame.</p>
<p>If I cannot thus bring thieves into my presence,</p>
<p>It means that none of them are here on earth.’ {53.463}</p>
<p>“Nanda, accomplished in ritual performance</p>
<p>And strict in keeping his observances, will then rise up.</p>
<p>Determined to summon them swiftly,</p>
<p>He will employ whatever mantra</p>
<p>Is prescribed for the summoning</p>
<p>From whatever direction.{53.464}</p>
<p>“The moment he merely recollects them,</p>
<p>They will arrive, ready to act.</p>
<p>With the single syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>He will summon to earth Brahmā and the others. {53.465}</p>
<p>“He will thus summon all the gods,</p>
<p>Brahmā and the others, including Śakra.</p>
<p>Uttering the shouts of hā! hā!</p>
<p>They will make frightening noise, asking,</p>
<p>‘What should I do? Why have you brought me here?</p>
<p>I have done nothing wrong!’ {53.466}</p>
<p>“Promptly and hastily,</p>
<p>The wise and fearless monk</p>
<p>Will address the gods:</p>
<p>‘Bring the pot, wherever it is, back here!’ {53.467}</p>
<p>“Passing on the monk’s words,</p>
<p>The gods will all say to one another,</p>
<p>‘Quickly name the fellow</p>
<p>Who stole the pot!’</p>
<p>They will thus look for the pot</p>
<p>But will not find it anywhere. {53.468}</p>
<p>“The lord of the gods himself will look</p>
<p>Into the matter and ask, ‘Who stole the pot?’</p>
<p>He will see the glorious bodhisattva of great splendor,</p>
<p>The holder of the vajra,{53.469}</p>
<p>“And his terrible son,</p>
<p>Very wrathful and terrifying,</p>
<p>Who roams the entire world,</p>
<p>Manifesting in the form of a vighna.{53.470}</p>
<p>“Knowing that it was he who stole the pot,</p>
<p>The lord of gods will say,</p>
<p>‘There is a vighna in the Vajra family.</p>
<p>He playfully sports on earth. {53.471}</p>
<p>“ ‘He makes offerings to me,</p>
<p>And that’s why he stole the pot.’</p>
<p>After saying this, the lord of gods</p>
<p>Will return to his celestial abode. {53.472}</p>
<p>“Nanda will then dismiss all the gods,</p>
<p>Using their respective mantras.</p>
<p>Immediately, in a mere instant,</p>
<p>They will be transported [back to their places].{53.473}</p>
<p>“He will summon the vighna,</p>
<p>Who is powerless and has the pot.</p>
<p>He will then employ him</p>
<p>To take the pot to the pretas.{53.474}</p>
<p>“The vighna, guided [there and back],</p>
<p>Will say the following:</p>
<p>‘As I have delivered the pot to the preta realm,</p>
<p>I am free from any offense.’ {53.475}</p>
<p>“The great practitioner of mantra</p>
<p>Will scold the vighna angrily:</p>
<p>‘Go, go, great vighna,</p>
<p>And don’t do this again!’ {53.476}</p>
<p>“Immediately</p>
<p>He will summon the pretas,</p>
<p>Whose mouths are as small as the eye of a needle</p>
<p>And who are disturbed by hunger and distressed. {53.477}</p>
<p>“These very dreadful creatures</p>
<p>Will let out wretched cries,</p>
<p>Wailing in piteous voices,</p>
<p>‘Protect us, O great being! {53.478}</p>
<p>“ ‘Here is your pot.</p>
<p>Having been summoned, we will do whatever you want.’</p>
<p>The mantra adept, filled with great compassion,</p>
<p>Will start trembling. {53.479}</p>
<p>“His mind tender with compassion,</p>
<p>He will say the following:</p>
<p>‘Tell me without delay</p>
<p>About your sufferings in the world.’ {53.480}</p>
<p>“Dejected in their minds, they will say,</p>
<p>‘For a long time, in the realm of the pretas,</p>
<p>We have been afflicted with hunger</p>
<p>And thirst, O great being!’ {53.481}</p>
<p>“The monk, filled with compassion,</p>
<p>Will then present the pot to them.</p>
<p>Uplifted in their minds,</p>
<p>They will hastily return to their abodes.</p>
<p>Food and drink will now appear in the pot</p>
<p>Whenever they merely think of it. {53.482}</p>
<p>“The monk Nanda will dwell</p>
<p>On earth in a sandalwood grove.</p>
<p>He will live during the debased period</p>
<p>For three hundred years.</p>
<p>Noble-minded and dedicated to the pursuit of awakening,</p>
<p>He will soon attain the realization so difficult to attain.{53.483}</p>
<p>“There will certainly come, at that time</p>
<p>During the debased eon,</p>
<p>An important Gomin king</p>
<p>Who will [try to] eradicate my teachings. {53.484}</p>
<p>“Starting from the east,</p>
<p>And up to the gateway into Kaśmīra,</p>
<p>This fool will destroy</p>
<p>Monasteries and reliquaries. {53.485}</p>
<p>“In his stupidity, he will kill</p>
<p>Monks who are disciplined,</p>
<p>Until, having retreated north,</p>
<p>The fool will meet his death. {53.486}</p>
<p>“He will be buried in a landslide</p>
<p>Caused by an angry nonhuman being,</p>
<p>Together with his subjects, animals, and kinsmen.</p>
<p>This fool will be reborn in the nether world. {53.487}</p>
<p>“Following a downward course,</p>
<p>He will fall from one hell to the next,</p>
<p>Experiencing ever greater suffering,</p>
<p>Intense and terrifying. {53.488}</p>
<p>“That prominent Gomin [king],</p>
<p>Will be rescued after one great eon</p>
<p>From the hell called Avīci,</p>
<p>Where evildoers go. {53.489}</p>
<p>“Meeting wrong friends,</p>
<p>Beings commit terrible evil.</p>
<p>Therefore, with all care,</p>
<p>You should put all your trust</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>You will then enjoy good fortune. {53.490}</p>
<p>“All of you should always follow</p>
<p>The eightfold path,</p>
<p>Which invariably leads to buddhahood,</p>
<p>The city without aging or sorrow. {53.491}</p>
<p>“Next after him will come</p>
<p>The king known as Buddhapakṣa.</p>
<p>He will enjoy great support, be truly renounced,</p>
<p>And delight in the teachings of the buddhas.</p>
<p>He will come, there is no doubt,</p>
<p>During the debased eon. {53.492}</p>
<p>“The king will be loved by all</p>
<p>And devoted to the teachings of the Teacher.</p>
<p>He will build monasteries, lay gardens, and caityas</p>
<p>And commission superb images of the Teacher. {53.493}</p>
<p>“He will also construct many</p>
<p>Ponds, tanks, and reservoirs.</p>
<p>Having done all this, this great king</p>
<p>Will go to heaven at a ripe age. {53.494}</p>
<p>“While on earth, he will accomplish</p>
<p>The mantra of Abjaketu of great efficacy,</p>
<p>And he will ask this bodhisattva, the great being,</p>
<p>To protect the earth.{53.495}</p>
<p>“By the power of Abjaketu’s mantra,</p>
<p>Buddhapakṣa will live three hundred years.</p>
<p>With his accumulation of good karma,</p>
<p>He will swiftly attain awakening. {53.496}</p>
<p>“His son will likewise be a king,</p>
<p>With a great powerful army.</p>
<p>He will be called Gambhīrapakṣa</p>
<p>Throughout the entire earth.{53.497}</p>
<p>“This king, at that time,</p>
<p>Will be very dedicated to his work.</p>
<p>He will build numerous monasteries,</p>
<p>Lodgings, reliquaries, ponds, and wells.</p>
<p>This king of great splendor</p>
<p>Will undoubtedly do such things. {53.498}</p>
<p>“He will accomplish the mantra</p>

<p>The phrase known as the six syllables,</p>
<p>Pregnant in meaning and conducive to well-being. {53.499}</p>
<p>“By the power of this mantra</p>
<p>He will experience great comforts.</p>
<p>In due course he will obtain intelligence</p>
<p>And swiftly travel the path to awakening.</p>

<p>Related to the Tathāgata’s teachings. {53.500}</p>
<p>“At that time,</p>
<p>In the north,</p>
<p>In the country called Nepāla</p>
<p>Nestled at the foothills of the snowy mountains,</p>

<p>Born to the Licchavi clan. {53.501}</p>
<p>“He too, having accomplished his mantric quest,</p>

<p>The kingdom will be free from thieves. {53.502}</p>
<p>“When his life ends,</p>
<p>The king will go to heaven.</p>

<p>“The world-renowned Tārā,</p>

<p>After that, the kings will defy propriety</p>
<p>By serving the interests of foreigners.{53.507}</p>
<p>“At that time, the king of Nepāla</p>
<p>Will perish from armed onslaughts.</p>
<p>The vidyās will be lost, and so will be the kings</p>

<p>“He will be honored by the mlecchas as a conqueror</p>

<p>Which confers great fortune and authority. {53.512}</p>
<p>“With this mantra, which is certain to confer</p>

<p>He then ordered his son</p>
<p>To take the bowl and pass it to the monk. {53.730}</p>
<p>“The boy, having understood,</p>
<p>Carefully washed his hands,</p>
<p>Took the full bowl,</p>
<p>And handed it to the dispassionate monk. {53.731}</p>
<p>“Having handed it over,</p>
<p>He promptly fell at the monk’s feet.</p>
<p>The dispassionate one took the bowl,</p>
<p>Went back to his monastery, and ate the food.</p>
<p>Free from attachment,</p>
<p>He obtained a pleasant sense of satisfaction. {53.732}</p>
<p>“Another boy, however,</p>
<p>Experienced feelings of envy.</p>
<p>The next day,</p>
<p>Feeling nothing but anger,</p>
<p>He took plenty of hard and soft food</p>
<p>And offered it to the dispassionate one, saying, {53.733}</p>
<p>“ ‘If there is any virtue</p>
<p>In offering alms to you,</p>
<p>May I become, through this,</p>
<p>Richer than the merchant’s son on this earth.’ {53.734}</p>
<p>“Then all the tīrthikas</p>
<p>And all the brahmin wives</p>
<p>Gathered together</p>
<p>And quarreled, criticizing one another: {53.735}</p>
<p>“ ‘Don’t you know this, you fool!</p>
<p>How can the “bald heads” get anywhere?</p>
<p>Not abiding in the Self,</p>
<p>How could these outsiders ever attain nirvāṇa?’ {53.736}</p>
<p>“A similar hatred</p>
<p>Arose in the boy.</p>
<p>He subsequently destroyed</p>
<p>Things that were praised by the Teacher: {53.737}</p>
<p>“The ever-celebrated Bridge of the Dharma</p>
<p>And the best monasteries and caityas.</p>
<p>He also murdered the son</p>
<p>Of that senior merchant.{53.738}</p>
<p>“[He said at that time,] ‘What would I gain</p>
<p>By giving them a pot of water?</p>
<p>I will exterminate these “bald heads”</p>
<p>Who are preoccupied with the thoughts of lower rebirth.’ {53.739}</p>
<p>“The boy who said this</p>
<p>Will be the king by the name Soma.</p>
<p>He will experience pain for a long time,</p>
<p>As the inevitable result of his karma.{53.740}</p>
<p>“The son of that senior merchant</p>
<p>Went to heaven when he died.</p>
<p>Time after time, he experienced</p>
<p>Pleasures among the celestial beings. {53.741}</p>
<p>“Again and again, he lived in the gods’ realms.</p>
<p>When he departs from that realm,</p>
<p>In his final birth,</p>
<p>He will cut the bonds completely. {53.742}</p>
<p>“In his third life as a human,</p>
<p>He will become the ruler of the land,</p>
<p>But, because of his karma, he will fall again and again,</p>
<p>At different times and in different places. {53.743}</p>
<p>“His birth will be in this world,</p>
<p>Where he will carry out the duties of a king on earth.</p>
<p>Because he had offered to the stūpa,</p>
<p>In play, as a child, flowers that had been discarded, {53.744}</p>
<p>“His pleasures will be tainted</p>
<p>As the result of his tainted generosity.</p>
<p>Like a broken joint,</p>
<p>This king will obtain pleasure with difficulty. {53.745}</p>
<p>“Because his large offering</p>
<p>To a Teacher’s reliquary on earth</p>
<p>Was done wholly without firmness, naively,</p>
<p>And with an unsteady mind, {53.746}</p>
<p>“He will, by the maturing of this karma,</p>
<p>Experience instability in his reign—</p>
<p>Now he will be king,</p>
<p>Now he will not.{53.747}</p>
<p>“He will act as king in the northern,</p>
<p>Eastern, and central territories.</p>
<p>Because the monk, free in his mind,</p>
<p>Was first bound and then released by the boy, {53.748}</p>
<p>“The boy was, by the ripening of this karma,</p>
<p>Bound and released</p>
<p>Repeatedly over the course</p>
<p>Of five hundred lives. {53.749}</p>
<p>“In his final birth, though, he will</p>
<p>Break out of his bondage once and for all.</p>
<p>In that life he will rule fifty-five years,</p>
<p>Or perhaps seventy-seven.</p>
<p>He will be king on earth,</p>
<p>Up to the shore of the eastern ocean. {53.750}</p>
<p>“All the mleccha bandits from the borderlands</p>
<p>Who live in the Vindhya valleys</p>
<p>Will come under the control</p>

<p>“And so will those that live up north,</p>
<p>In the foothills of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>This kṣatriya king will rule at that time</p>
<p>All the provinces. {53.752}</p>
<p>“Because, in his simplicity,</p>
<p>He built a stūpa out of sand when still a child,</p>
<p>He will become the king of Magadha.</p>
<p>He will rule, without rivals and without troubles,</p>
<p>Up to the frontier forests</p>
<p>And as far as the eastern ocean. {53.753}</p>
<p>“The wise king will propagate</p>
<p>The teachings of the Teacher</p>
<p>From the west bank of the Brahmaputra</p>
<p>To the Himalayas in the north,</p>
<p>The pleasant city of Kāśī in the west,</p>

<p>“After conquering the two kings</p>
<p>Called Pañcakesarī,</p>
<p>The king will consolidate his rule.</p>
<p>The entire [dynastic] family of Siṃha</p>
<p>Will be uprooted and destroyed. {53.755}</p>
<p>“This kṣatriya king</p>
<p>Will then rule all the provinces</p>

<p>“The Siṃha kings, such as Deva and so forth,</p>
<p>Will rule over other rogue peoples,</p>

<p>As the king over [all] the inhabitants of the Vindhyas. {53.757}</p>
<p>“In the middle country said to be difficult to access,</p>
<p>An extremely wicked king will rule.</p>
<p>There will likewise be another king named Siṃha,</p>
<p>Who will rule over the north and the east. {53.758}</p>
<p>“At that time, when even the people of Gauḍa are afraid,</p>
<p>There will be, there is no doubt,</p>

<p>Described as ‘born prosperous.’ {53.759}</p>
<p>“Born into increasing prosperity,</p>
<p>The king will likewise experience increasing comforts.</p>
<p>Even in his old age,</p>
<p>His enjoyments will not change. {53.760}</p>
<p>“He will live for eighty years,</p>
<p>Seven [months], and seven [days].</p>

<p>In terms of livelihood, an accomplished trader.{53.763}</p>
<p>“Having met a virtuous friend,</p>
<p>He will become a follower of the Victor’s teachings</p>

<p>The vidyārājñī of great power and dignity. {53.764}</p>
<p>“Having accomplished the mantra,</p>

<p>Through the direct application of the mantra methods.</p>
<p>You, the sagacious one, should always remember it as</p>
<p>The fulfiller of the goals of the mantra system.” {53.923}</p>
<p>This concludes the fifty-third chapter, with the prophecy about the kings, from “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings, complete with all the chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 54</p>
<p>Directing his gaze again at the realm of the Pure Abode, the blessed Śākyamuni said this to Mañjuśrī, the divine youth: {54.1}</p>
<p>“Wherever, Mañjuśrī, this Dharma discourse is disseminated, you should know that I am present there myself, surrounded by the hosts of all the bodhisattvas, taking the place of honor among the congregation of śrāvakas, and attended upon by a retinue of all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, garuḍas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, siddhas, vidyādharas, and other nonhuman and human beings. The Tathāgata resides there for the sake of protecting, sheltering, and defending. {54.2}</p>
<p>“One should know, Mañjuśrī, divine youth, about the ten advantages obtained in any place where this Dharma treasury of the tathāgatas is written down in the form of a book, read aloud,  memorized, or respectfully and sincerely worshiped with various implements such as yak-tail whisks, streamers, parasols, banners, flags, bells, music, garlands, scented oils, incense, or pleasant fragrances. These ten advantages are obtained in any place where this Dharma treasury is revered, reflected upon, or focused upon with an undivided mind. What are these ten? {54.3}</p>
<p>“There will be (1) no danger in that [place] of military invasions or hunger; (2) no pestilence caused by Mahāmārī or other dangers from nonhuman beings; (3) no danger of fire or anything untoward; (4) no danger of drought or excessive rains; (5) no danger of hurricanes, tornadoes, or kravyādas; (6) no danger from Śakra or any rogues or robbers; (7) no danger of untimely death or fear caused by King Yama; (8) no danger from asuras or any gods, nāgas, yakṣas, or gandharvas; (9) no danger from mantras, venoms, or poisons; and (10) no danger of disease, fever, dysentery, indigestion, or other danger to body or limb. One should know that these ten benefits occur wherever this Dharma treasury of the tathāgatas, contained in this great extensive manual, is kept in the form of a book.  Let us therefore write it down, read it aloud, worship it, memorize it, and rehearse it.{54.4}</p>
<p>“This Dharma treasury of the tathāgatas is extremely occult, as it depends in every respect on the mantras. It must not be taught to those who have not received the samaya from the master or those who do not understand the samaya. Why is this? This is because it is secret; it is an occult teaching. It is a teaching [arising from] omniscience. No beings should ever reject or take it lightly.{54.5}</p>
<p>“If [those who received it] do not worship [this Dharma treasury] and treat it with respect, they will incur a lot of negativity. One must not disclose it to others, as they could commit negative acts, such as suppressing the secret [practices], killing sentient beings, reporting [you] to the king, shortening lives, or causing other misfortunes. It can only be disclosed to beings who have taken up the secret practice of mantras and keep their samaya secret—to beings who are well established and trained in the study and practice of the Tathāgata’s instructions, who have good knowledge of the meaning of the Dharma, who keep their samaya concerning the sense bases and psychophysical elements, and who live by the Dharma and are thus true to their promises, firm in their observances, have entered the path of good conduct, and are compassionate. It can be disclosed only to them and not to others.” {54.6}</p>
<p>The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, rose from his seat, draped his robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, and asked the Blessed One with folded hands, “What is this Dharma discourse really, O Blessed One? What should I remember it as?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied: {54.7}</p>
<p>“You should remember it as a basket of bodhisattva teachings, the thundering roar of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>“You should remember it as a text that contains the marvelous and wondrous Dharma instructions.</p>
<p>“You should remember it as the bodhisattvas’ instructions for taking up all the practices of the ‘mantra basket.’</p>
<p>“You should remember it as an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra with marvelous instructions.</p>
<p>“You should remember it as the root manual of Noble Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>“You should remember it as the instructions that fulfill all the aims of the Dharma. {54.8}</p>
<p>“You are a very powerful bodhisattva</p>
<p>Who travels everywhere</p>
<p>Throughout every realm where there are</p>
<p>Those who practice the Dharma and those who do not. {54.9}</p>
<p>“Do you not see that this profoundly secret teaching</p>
<p>Is the best of the best among the sūtras</p>
<p>That treat the subject of the mantra methods,</p>
<p>As it removes the dangers related to the place of rebirth? {54.10}</p>
<p>“Do you not see, O valiant one,</p>
<p>That this supreme teaching has awakening as its goal?</p>
<p>That an esoteric sūtra such as this</p>
<p>Is adorned with the meaning that needs to be inferred?{54.11}</p>
<p>“The diverse meanings of the sūtras</p>
<p>Are presented here according to the mantra system.</p>
<p>There is no other such sūtra in existence,</p>
<p>Apart from this extensive manual of rites. {54.12}</p>
<p>“One can obtain kingship, great comforts,</p>
<p>The great fortunes of the gods,</p>
<p>Prosperity, and fame,</p>
<p>Both celestial and human. {54.13}</p>
<p>“One will be able to avoid the eight unfree states,</p>
<p>And bring about the eight freedoms.</p>
<p>One will become a master of the three vehicles</p>
<p>Destined to attain buddhahood. {54.14}</p>
<p>“There is merit in memorizing this sūtra</p>
<p>And there are the following advantages:</p>
<p>Neither poison nor fire will be able</p>
<p>To harm any part of one’s body, {54.15}</p>
<p>“And whatever vetālas, grahas,</p>
<p>Pūtanas, mātṛs, thieves,</p>
<p>Rākṣasas, or piśācas there are,{54.16}</p>
<p>“They will not be able to harm</p>
<p>Someone who recites this sūtra,</p>
<p>Memorizes it, or worships it, again and again,</p>
<p>With offerings of various kinds. {54.17}</p>
<p>“Fearless, one should worship it</p>
<p>With music and anything that may be offered.</p>
<p>One will then obtain</p>
<p>The following advantages: {54.18}</p>
<p>“If one is unwell, one will be freed from disease.</p>
<p>If one experiences suffering, one will become happy.</p>
<p>If one is poor, one will obtain wealth.</p>
<p>If one is in bondage, one will be freed. {54.19}</p>
<p>“One who has fallen into the suffering of saṃsāra</p>
<p>With its five realms of rebirth</p>
<p>Will attain the unwavering state</p>
<p>Of well-being, happiness, and nirvāṇa. {54.20}</p>
<p>“One will realize the awakening of a pratyeka­buddha</p>
<p>Or attain the state of a śrāvaka.</p>
<p>If one reads this sūtra aloud,</p>
<p>One will attain buddhahood.{54.21}</p>
<p>“The merit of reciting this sūtra is the same as</p>
<p>All the merit that one would obtain through</p>
<p>Worshiping the victorious ones, said to be</p>
<p>As uncountable as the sand grains in the Gaṅgā. {54.22}</p>
<p>“If one were to continually worship the names</p>
<p>Of the buddhas as numerous as the atoms</p>
<p>In the tens of millions of inconceivable [buddha]fields,</p>
<p>However many there are in this world; {54.23}</p>
<p>“If one were to offer to these buddhas various types</p>
<p>Of food, drink, invigorating tonics,</p>
<p>And various seats and beds,</p>
<p>Giving them continually to all of them; {54.24}</p>
<p>“And if one were to offer them various garments,</p>
<p>Scented powders, robes, ornaments,</p>
<p>Parasols, shoes, cloth,</p>
<p>Fragrances, garlands, unguents, {54.25}</p>
<p>“And various types of incense,</p>
<p>With lamps all around,</p>
<p>The merit thus obtained would be the same</p>
<p>As the merit obtained by memorizing and reciting this teaching. {54.26}</p>
<p>“However many pratyeka­buddhas there are</p>
<p>In this world, or śrāvakas of great majesty,</p>
<p>Or bodhisattvas, great beings</p>
<p>Established on the tenth level, {54.27}</p>
<p>“The merit that one would obtain</p>
<p>Through worshiping them</p>
<p>Would be the same as the merit of someone</p>
<p>Who holds [this sūtra] volume in their hand. {54.28}</p>
<p>“However many beings are said to dwell</p>
<p>In the world with its spheres,</p>
<p>Who are described as being free</p>
<p>From the fever [of the afflictions], {54.29}</p>
<p>“The merit that one would obtain</p>
<p>Through worshiping them sincerely, again and again,</p>
<p>Would be the same that a wise person would obtain</p>
<p>Through worshiping this supreme teaching. {54.30}</p>
<p>“Not even the most eminent, jewel-like victors</p>
<p>Can obtain the same merit in tens of millions of eons</p>
<p>That one can obtain through worshiping</p>
<p>This finest Dharma treasury of the lords of the world. {54.31}</p>
<p>“If one recites and memorizes the mantras</p>
<p>Taught by Mañjughoṣa in this manual,</p>
<p>This supreme teaching will become</p>
<p>A precious wish-fulfilling jewel. {54.32}</p>
<p>“It will become a cow of plenty for the reciter,</p>
<p>And a source of great enjoyment  and wealth.</p>
<p>If someone with an indefatigable mind</p>
<p>Accomplishes these mantras here on earth, {54.33}</p>
<p>“They will bring results, as taught by the Sage,</p>
<p>With the inferred meaning becoming the true meaning.</p>
<p>If one performs the rites at the right time,</p>
<p>One will become a vidyādhara on earth. {54.34}</p>
<p>“All the places, it is said, will be replete for him</p>
<p>With precious good fortune.</p>
<p>His illustrious course of rebirths will be fruitful,</p>
<p>And his actions will be praised by the good. {54.35}</p>
<p>“Should a king memorize a single mantra</p>
<p>From this excellent manual,</p>
<p>He will obtain a royal fortune with all its benefits,</p>
<p>And a long and prosperous life. {54.36}</p>
<p>“Such a distinguished king will obtain</p>
<p>A life of various pleasurable pursuits.</p>
<p>He will not be harmed by weapons or poisons,</p>
<p>Whether from animate or inanimate sources, {54.37}</p>
<p>“Or the effects of inimical magical vidyās,</p>
<p>Such as the mantras employed in the vetāla practices.</p>
<p>Corrupt practitioners who engage in hostile rites</p>
<p>Here on earth will not be able to harm him. {54.38}</p>
<p>“He will not be in any danger of fire.</p>
<p>Malevolent grahas or other such beings</p>
<p>Will not assail his body, regardless of</p>
<p>Whether he is a king or an ordinary person.{54.39}</p>
<p>“The same applies to any person who memorizes</p>
<p>And recites this excellent sūtra of great importance.</p>
<p>Any king who, before a battle,</p>
<p>Places it upon his head, {54.40}</p>
<p>“So that it forms a parasol above it,</p>
<p>And repeatedly pays homage to it,</p>
<p>Will not be killed by lowly men</p>
<p>With any of their various weapons.{54.41}</p>
<p>“If he sends into battle</p>
<p>An effigy of the princely youth,</p>
<p>Seated on a peacock seat</p>
<p>And mounted on the back of an elephant, {54.42}</p>
<p>“The enemies, seeing the divine youth</p>
<p>In his youthful form</p>
<p>Adorned with ornaments,</p>
<p>Will all become mutually hostile and retreat. {54.43}</p>
<p>“If this [effigy], made of gold or silver,</p>
<p>Is fitted onto a banner handle,</p>
<p>Raised up on top of banners and flags,</p>
<p>Well positioned and well set,{54.44}</p>
<p>“And taken to a battlefield</p>
<p>Swarming with enemies,</p>
<p>Their various weapons raised</p>
<p>At the commencement of fighting, {54.45}</p>
<p>“Those enemies will perish through merely seeing it</p>
<p>Or will become completely confused.</p>
<p>The human and nonhuman beings;</p>
<p>The human kings and the lords of gods; {54.46}</p>
<p>“The siddhas and the vidyādharas</p>
<p>Who rely on the mantra methods;</p>
<p>The rākṣasas, even though they may be courageous;</p>
<p>The kaṭapūtanas and the mātṛs; {54.47}</p>
<p>“The different types of kravyādas;</p>
<p>The yakṣas, kuṣmāṇḍas, and pūtanas—</p>
<p>All will become incapacitated through merely seeing</p>
<p>The raised banner with the divine youth perched upon it, {54.48}</p>
<p>“All-accomplishing and possessing</p>
<p>Many forms and aspects—</p>
<p>The great being Mañjughoṣa himself,</p>
<p>The supreme lord of the tenth level.{54.49}</p>
<p>“There once was a great kṣatriya king,</p>
<p>Who lived and reigned on earth.</p>
<p>He had faith, was free from indecision or doubts,</p>
<p>And was a fond patron of the Dharma. {54.50}</p>
<p>“Having generated faith in the Sugata,</p>
<p>With a mind filled with compassion</p>
<p>And eager to find the esoteric meaning,</p>
<p>He undertook to perform the rituals taught here. {54.51}</p>
<p>“The victors who abide in the sphere of phenomena</p>
<p>Taught these [rituals] as part of their doctrine.</p>
<p>They taught them in this manual of rites that employ mantras</p>
<p>And fit into the mantra system taught here on earth. {54.52}</p>
<p>“The innumerable victors of the past</p>
<p>Who dwell in the sphere of phenomena</p>
<p>Taught this Dharma treasury</p>
<p>On earth to human beings. {54.53}</p>
<p>“In times past, while a dreadful war</p>
<p>Was being waged between the gods and the asuras,</p>
<p>The army of [Indra]</p>
<p>Was destroyed by its enemies.{54.54}</p>
<p>“Alone on the earth, dispirited,</p>
<p>Without a chariot,</p>
<p>He approached, at that time, Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>The best of sages and the supreme Victor. {54.55}</p>
<p>“ ‘What can I do?’</p>
<p>Were the words uttered by the husband of Śacī.</p>
<p>‘I have been defeated by the cruel asuras</p>
<p>And now seek refuge here with you.’ {54.56}</p>
<p>“Having said this, the god of bounty</p>
<p>Who has performed one hundred sacrifices</p>
<p>Bowed to the distinguished sage,</p>
<p>Touching his feet with the top of his head, {54.57}</p>
<p>“And then the thousand-eyed Kauśika</p>
<p>Sat down as before.</p>
<p>The distinguished sage, brahmin Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>Thus addressed, {54.58}</p>
<p>“Replied in a voice as sweet</p>
<p>As the song of a cuckoo bird,</p>
<p>‘In the past, the supreme victors praised in songs</p>
<p>The divine youth who is the source of everything. {54.59}</p>
<p>“ ‘He is the great being Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Difficult to meet, endowed with one hundred thousand powers,</p>
<p>And said to abide in the ultimate reality.</p>
<p>He guides beings to the deep meaning. {54.60}</p>
<p>“ ‘You should recollect him now, O lord of gods,</p>
<p>As one who shows the Dharma to beings,</p>
<p>Himself being without conceptual elaboration,</p>
<p>Mental disposition, independent existence, or location.’ {54.61}</p>
<p>“Being thus caused by Kāśyapa to be recollected,</p>
<p>And then recollected by Indra as one who abides in reality,</p>
<p>Precisely at that moment,</p>
<p>The omnifarious divine youth</p>
<p>Arrived at the place where Blessed Kāśyapa</p>
<p>And Maghavan, the lord of gods, were.{54.62}</p>
<p>“After arriving, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī</p>
<p>Saluted the supreme Victor.</p>
<p>Having bowed to all the eminent victors</p>
<p>And to Kāśyapa of great splendor,</p>
<p>He pronounced the following mantra</p>
<p>After first obtaining the sage’s consent: {54.63}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas who are perfect teachers!</p>
<p>“ ‘Oṁ, kill, kill all those that pose danger! Destroy and annihilate them! Make them afraid! Crush, chop, and break them! Burn them, burn! Huṁ huṁ, phaṭ phaṭ, svāhā!’{54.64}</p>
<p>“As soon as this mantra was pronounced by the great being, the divine youth Mañjuśrī, the earth with its mountains and oceans, up to its farthest reaches, shook in six different ways, and so did all the infinite buddhafields and world spheres up to their farthest limits. All the blessed buddhas empowered the words of the mantra. {54.65}</p>
<p>“Śakra, the lord of gods, his fear gone and body hair bristling, struck with amazement and wonder, his eyes wide open, rose from his seat, bowed down to the feet of the Blessed One, and circumambulated him clockwise three times. Then, turning to and looking at the divine youth Mañjuśrī, he grasped and kept in his mind the words of the mantra. He mounted his chariot and rode to where all the asuras were. Confronted by him in their subterranean paradise, in their capital city that the ocean rests upon, they all attacked. However, seeing the lord of gods blazing like fire, the asuras became smitten and dazed in their minds,  and their armies were struck with fear. They now grew weak and despondent, their haughty expressions changed, and they lost their weapons. They turned back and retreated to their own abodes.{54.66}</p>
<p>“Śakra, the lord of gods, then addressed the gods in the realm of the Thirty-Three:</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not be afraid, friends, do not be afraid! We have defeated the asuras through the power of the Buddha. Now let us go home. Come, gentlemen! Having returned to your fine houses and abodes, each of you to his own, you can play, rejoice, and move around freely.’</p>
<p>“And so the gods, uplifted in their minds, turned around and went to their own abodes. {54.67}</p>
<p>“Śakra, the lord of gods, thought, ‘If I make an effigy in the form of the divine youth and mount it atop a banner, there will be no danger for me from the asuras.’ The lord of gods, with his great might, procured then a precious gem called Shining with the Inner Light, fashioned from it a figure in the form of the divine youth, firmly fixed it on top of a banner, and placed it in Sudharmā, the assembly hall of the gods, at the top of the palace in the middle of his great city Sudarśana. {54.68}</p>
<p>“From then on, the asuras, headed by Prahlāda and Vemacitri, stayed in their subterranean paradise. They did not travel upward, nor did they attack the gods. They were unable to work miracles or confront anyone in battle. This will last, in human reckoning, many hundreds of thousands of billions of years. Thus, there will now be no danger from the asuras. {54.69}</p>
<p>“This celebrated [Dharma treatise] is thus a boon of infinite qualities; it promotes long life and good health, as taught by the blessed buddhas and the great beings, the bodhisattvas in the past. It is full of excellent qualities and brings infinite benefits, without beginning and without end.{54.70}</p>
<p>“Anyone who contradicts this Dharma treatise, doubts it, or thoughtlessly steps over it will accumulate boundless nonvirtue. They will fall into one of the great hells or suffer the tribulations of birth in the animal realm or the Yama realm of the pretas. Those who claim that this Dharma treatise is not the word of the Buddha and that the mantras and the remedies in it do not come from the bodhisattvas, who deny the greatness of the bodhisattvas and their power to work miracles, who throw away or abandon this Dharma treatise claiming that it was originally taught by dishonorable people, they will proceed to the lower states of existence where they will be unable to understand this Dharma treatise or even hear it. When they depart from that state, they will have accumulated a great deal of nonvirtue, so it is said. {54.71}</p>
<p>“Foolish people who reject</p>
<p>This excellent teaching</p>
<p>Taught in song by the eminent sages</p>
<p>And the sagacious sons of the victors{54.72}</p>
<p>“Will, because of this, go to hell,</p>
<p>With its subdivisions lying above or horizontally,</p>
<p>Such as Kālasūtra, Sañjīva,</p>
<p>Kṣuradhārā, Gūthamṛttikā,{54.73}</p>
<p>“Kuṇapa, Kṣāranadī,</p>
<p>Where they will be seized in Jvaradhārā,</p>
<p>The terrible Asipattra forest,</p>
<p>Avava, Hahava, {54.74}</p>
<p>“Or the hell for evildoers,</p>
<p>Renowned in the world as Aṭaṭa.</p>
<p>Those who bring harm upon the Dharma</p>
<p>Will go to one of these hells. {54.75}</p>
<p>“The terrible hell called Avīci</p>
<p>Is well known in the world</p>
<p>As a walled-in place for reviled evildoers,</p>
<p>Who make up its population.{54.76}</p>
<p>“People who destroy this teaching</p>
<p>Will be roasted there.</p>
<p>People who are always mindless will visit</p>
<p>All of the hells as deep down as Avīci. {54.77}</p>
<p>“They will experience death and subsequent rebirth</p>
<p>Throughout the infinite hell realms.</p>
<p>Those who reject this extensive sūtra</p>
<p>That is the sum total of the Dharma{54.78}</p>
<p>“Become reviled in the world</p>
<p>And fall into the hells that end in Avīci,</p>
<p>Completely deprived of their own will.{54.79}</p>
<p>“This sūtra called the ‘Manual of Rites’</p>
<p>Is adorned with the knowledge of mantras.</p>
<p>Through hundreds of wonderful accomplishments,</p>
<p>It lays bare the ultimate reality,{54.80}</p>
<p>“Which is experienced in meditation without support</p>
<p>And constitutes the body of the sphere of phenomena.</p>
<p>This extensive manual of rites</p>
<p>With its detailed chapters {54.81}</p>
<p>“Was skillfully laid down by Mañjughoṣa</p>
<p>And duly worshiped by Śrīmati.</p>
<p>Many original rites of Mañjuśrī</p>
<p>Are presented here in full. {54.82}</p>
<p>“This manual is free from both extreme views,</p>
<p>Those of eternalism and of nihilism.</p>
<p>It explains the stages in the right order</p>
<p>And constitutes a collective body of mantras. {54.83}</p>
<p>“It clearly explains</p>
<p>Fire, wind, and space as empty.</p>
<p>One who rejects this manual is always reborn,</p>
<p>Going from one low birth to another. {54.84}</p>
<p>“As the supreme Victor,</p>
<p>I accumulated infinite merit</p>
<p>In the course of many long eons,</p>
<p>And attained awakening. {54.85}</p>
<p>“I subsequently taught this root manual</p>
<p>To fulfill the aims of the mantra system.</p>
<p>By being an auspicious means of purification that destroys negativity,</p>
<p>This manual wards off the dangers associated with the places of rebirth. {54.86}</p>
<p>“It has been presented in detailed chapters</p>
<p>That adorn this sūtra of definitive meaning.</p>
<p>It includes the descriptions of the great qualities of kings</p>
<p>Explained according to their relevant period and place. {54.87}</p>
<p>“This sacred Dharma of the victors’ sons</p>
<p>Was taught by the seventh sage,</p>
<p>The best among the victors</p>
<p>Who have taken human birth on earth. {54.88}</p>
<p>“It was taught in the form of this extensive manual</p>
<p>That produces  splendor and good fortune.</p>
<p>It is described as an extensive volume with a good foundation</p>
<p>And is revered as part of the mantra system.{54.89}</p>
<p>“Anyone on earth who rejects</p>
<p>This excellent, important sūtra,</p>
<p>This Dharma treasury endowed with power by the victors,</p>
<p>Will fall, after death, into Avīci, the worst of hells,</p>
<p>For many great eons, as described</p>
<p>In different works.{54.90}</p>
<p>“During his life as a human,</p>
<p>Whenever this happens to be,</p>
<p>He will be poor, diseased, and dumb.</p>
<p>He will be born as a mleccha,</p>
<p>Will be reviled in the world,</p>
<p>And will contract leprosy. {54.91}</p>
<p>“He will smell bad and inspire disgust.</p>
<p>Blind and missing limbs,</p>
<p>He will have a terribly unattractive form,</p>
<p>Always be dirty, and look, here on earth, like a preta. {54.92}</p>
<p>“He will be poorly clothed, depressed,</p>
<p>With ugly nails, and generally detestable.</p>
<p>He will be eaten by parasites</p>
<p>And will be covered by sores and blisters. {54.93}</p>
<p>“Stinking and utterly revolting,</p>
<p>He will have no partner for conversation</p>
<p>But will walk around absentmindedly,</p>
<p>Becoming ever more feebleminded.{54.94}</p>
<p>“One who rejects this Dharma treasury,</p>
<p>This revered relic of the victorious ones,</p>
<p>Will meet with a lot of pain</p>
<p>And be without relatives, friends, or a protector.{54.95}</p>
<p>“As a human being, one will experience</p>
<p>Many times grief and suffering.</p>
<p>Wherever one goes,</p>
<p>One will never be happy.</p>
<p>Different [negative] results will follow</p>
<p>If one rejects this sūtra.”{54.96}</p>
<p>The divine youth Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva great being, now rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over his shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, folded his hands, and, with wide open and unblinking eyes, knowing that all the gods who inhabit the Pure Abode and many orders of beings had assembled in order to hear the Dharma, said to Blessed Śākyamuni: {54.97}</p>
<p>“It is wonderful, O Blessed One, that you have presented this Dharma treatise so eloquently. In the future time, O Blessed One, it will come to pass that beings will be overcome by dangerous greed, their minds will be dominated by the five degenerations, they will lack faith, and they will be deceitful, unruly, and undisciplined. They will not believe in the greatness of the of the art of mantras,  nor will they appreciate the necessity to observe the restrictions regarding the time and the place of worship. Nor will they believe in the elaborate rituals with their injunctions pertaining to the mantra conduct, homa offerings, or mantra recitation. Thinking that this is not the Buddha’s teaching, they will reject it. They will develop mental anguish and die. They will thus experience intense suffering and feel sharp and acute pain. They will end up in the great hells. When beings suffer like this, O Blessed One, how can this be remedied? The lord buddhas are very compassionate, after all.” {54.98}</p>
<p>The blessed Śākyamuni touched Mañjuśrī, the divine youth, on the head, and said, “Good it is, good indeed, that you, Mañjuśrī, are concerned about the welfare and the interests of all beings, and it is also good that you, Mañjuśrī, ask the Tathāgata about it. Listen well, then, and duly reflect upon what I will now tell you for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of all beings and to act kindly toward the world. There is, O divine youth, in your root manual with its detailed chapters, a most secret vidyārāja that should be remembered at the time of death by men and gods who strongly desire to take the final refuge in the supreme body of the dharmadhātu, thus taking the path to awakening that subsumes all mantra practices. So what is this vidyā? {54.99}</p>
<p>“Homage to all the worthy tathāgatas, the fully realized buddhas!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, the omnifarious form of the divine youth, come, come! Quick, quick! Bhrūṃ bhrūṃ, hūṁ hūṁ! O victorious Victor! Splendorous Mañjuśrī! Deliver me from all suffering! Phaṭ phaṭ! Pacify, pacify! You who arise from and are the source of immortality, destroy my negativity, svāhā!{54.100}</p>
<p>“This, Mañjuśrī, is your ultimate heart essence that makes everything peaceful, removes all negativity, and releases from all suffering. It brings long life, good health, vigor, supreme well-being, and increases the powers of speech. It also stirs up the goodness in all the vidyā kings.”</p>
<p>As soon as the blessed Buddha Śākyamuni pronounced this mantra, this great earth with all its mountains, oceans, and animate and inanimate things, up to its farthest reaches, shook in six different ways, and the sufferings of all the beings of the different classes—the pretas, the animals, and all the beings in the worlds of Yama —completely ceased.{54.101}</p>
<p>“This king of mantras, Mañjuśrī, should be kept in mind, so that, at that time, there will be no thought of giving up the sacred Dharma, the evil māras will not have any opportunity to cause harm, and all the vighnas and vināyakas will run away.</p>
<p>“The blessed buddhas will know my thoughts, if I should reflect, ‘What am I capable of? Will I accept or reject the inconceivable Dharma of the realization of the blessed buddhas?’ ”{54.102}</p>
<p>This concludes the detailed chapter about the consequences of praising or blaming [this Dharma manual], fifty-fourth in “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” an extensive Mahāyāna sūtra that forms a garland-like basket of bodhisattva teachings.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had finished teaching,  the monks, the bodhisattvas, their retinues, and billions of other beings present above the Pure Abode such as gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, siddhas, and vidyādharas; as well as many prominent ṛṣis and the great bodhisattva beings including the divine youth Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya, Mahā­sthāna­prāpta, Vajrapāṇi, and so forth; the blessed buddhas with the retinues of śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas who dwell in innumerable world systems and in the infinite sphere of phenomena; and the inconceivable buddhas dwelling in the sky-like nature and the bodhisattva great beings, were all very pleased and praised the Blessed One’s teaching.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Root Manual of Noble Mañjuśrī,” presented as it was passed down.</p>
<p>By order of the glorious ruler and renunciant king Jangchub O, this text was translated, edited, and finalized by the great Indian preceptor and spiritual teacher Kumārakalaśa and the translator Lotsawa and monk Śākya Lodrö.</p>
