<p>Homage to the Three Jewels!</p>
<p>namo mañjuśriye kumārabhūtāya  ||</p>
<p>tadyathā | oṁ araje viraje | śuddhe viśuddhe | śodhani  viśodhani | śodhaya viśodhaya | amale vimale | jayavati ru ru cale | hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ | phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā ||</p>
<p>Those who memorize this will become intelligent within one month. Their voice will be melodious. Their appearance will be beautiful. After a single reading they will turn their back on cyclic existence for a thousand eons. By merely holding it in their hands they will recall former lives. After a hundred thousand recitations they will become erudite. After two hundred thousand recitations they will become vidyādharas.  After three hundred thousand recitations they will behold the face of Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>If one who has committed the five misdeeds with immediate retribution does not thus succeed, then may I myself become guilty of committing the five misdeeds with immediate retribution and of deceiving the blessed buddhas.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Noble Lord Mañjuśrī’s Dḥāraṇī for Increasing Insight and Intelligence.”</p>
