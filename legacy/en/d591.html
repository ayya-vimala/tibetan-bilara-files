</header>
<p>The Supreme Accomplishment of Invincible Averting, Sitātapatrā Born from the Uṣṇīṣa of the Tathāgata</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas and to the noble śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas! Homage to the blessed invincible Uṣṇīṣa Queen!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Excellent Dharma, the assembly hall of the gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, together with a great assembly of monks, a great assembly of bodhisattvas, and Śakra, the lord of the gods. The Blessed One sat down on a seat arranged for him and entered the samādhi called uṣṇīṣa gaze. As soon as he entered this samādhi, the words of this mantra formula issued from the center of the Blessed One’s uṣṇīṣa:</p>
<p>“Homage to the Buddha.</p>
<p>Homage to the Dharma.</p>
<p>Homage to the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>Homage to the seventy million completely perfect buddhas.</p>

<p>Homage to Maitreya and all the other bodhisattva great beings.</p>
<p>“Homage to the arhats of this world.</p>

<p>“After paying homage to these blessed ones, this great invincible spell for averting, the blessed Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of the Tathāgata, annihilates all bhūtas who are grahas; disrupts all opposing spells; averts all forms of untimely death; frees beings from all that would kill or bind them; averts all malice, nightmares, and bad omens; destroys all yakṣas and rākṣasas who are grahas; destroys the eighty-four thousand types of grahas; appeases the twenty-eight lunar mansions; destroys the eight great celestial bodies; averts all enemies; destroys all violence, malice, and nightmares; averts poison, weapons, fire, and water; and liberates from all fear of the lower realms.</p>
<p>“She is invincible and greatly terrifying,</p>

<p>“She is Kusumbharatnā and Vairocanā</p>
<p>And the one renowned as Vajroṣṇīṣā.</p>
<p>“May this entire host of mudrās and mantra deities protect me, my community, and all beings!</p>

<p>“Whoever writes this invincible queen of spells for averting, Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas, on birch bark, cloth, or tree bark and wears it on their body or around their neck or reads it will not be harmed by poison, weapons, fire, water, poisonous brews, poisonous compounds, or kākhordas for as long as they live, nor will they meet an untimely death. They will become dear to all grahas, vighnas, and vināyakas. The eighty-four billion goddesses of the vajra family and the accomplished goddesses will always and perpetually guard, protect, and defend them. They will become dear to and delight those goddesses. They will recall their rebirths of the past eighty-four thousand great eons. The sixty-four vajra dūtīs will also always constantly follow and defend them.  They will never become yakṣas, rākṣasas, pretas, piśācas, pūtanas, or kaṭapūtanas, nor will they ever be poor. They will gain a quantity of merit equal to that of the blessed buddhas as innumerable and limitless as the grains of sand in the river Ganges. Blessed buddhas and bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Ganges will always guard, protect, and defend them, and they will please and gladden those buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>“If one keeps this queen of spells for averting called the invincible Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas, one will become chaste if one was not chaste. Those who did not observe silence will observe silence. The impure will become pure. Those who did not practice abstinence will practice abstinence. Even those who committed the five acts with immediate retribution will be purified. All the obscurations resulting from their past actions will be exhausted without exception.</p>
<p>“If a son or daughter of noble family who wishes to have a child keeps or recites this queen of spells for averting, Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas, they will gain a child. The child will have a long life and possess merit and strength. After they pass away they will take birth in the realm of Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>“Those who are threatened by diseases that affect humans or livestock or by calamities, violence, harm, epidemics, mental disturbances, and the approach of opposing armies should affix this invincible queen of spells for averting called Sitātapatrā born from the uṣṇīṣa of all tathāgatas to the top of a banner and worship it with great offerings. The banner should then be planted at the gateway to any city or in a town, city, market town, country, or monastery.  This noble, invincible, great queen of spells for averting should be worshiped and planted. As soon as it has been planted, war will be pacified, as will calamities, violence, harm, epidemics, mental disturbances, and the approach of opposing armies.</p>

<p>“The nāga kings Ananta, Śaṅkhapāla, and Mahākṛṣṇa will send timely rain, clouds, and peals of thunder. When facing any calamity, this should be recited three times in connection with the Buddha.”</p>
<p>The buddhas and bodhisattvas, together with the whole world of devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thus concludes the noble dhāraṇī “The Supreme Accomplishment of Invincible Averting, Sitātapatrā Born from the Uṣṇīṣa of the Tathāgata.”</p>
