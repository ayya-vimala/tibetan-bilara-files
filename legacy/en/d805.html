<p>Tantra of Subāhu’s Questions</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Homage to the Omniscient One.</p>
<p>Subāhu paid respectful homage to the Lord of Yakṣas,</p>
<p>Brilliant like a thousand suns</p>
<p>And deeply immersed in compassion,</p>
<p>Then asked him how to master the collections of vidyā and mantra.</p>
<p>“I have not seen anyone on earth</p>
<p>Who has reached perfection through persistence</p>
<p>In recitation, fasting, or restrictive austerities.</p>
<p>Sole Father, do austerities not serve any purpose?</p>
<p>“Your Eminence, you are brilliant as sun-fire,</p>
<p>Supreme among those who purify and destroy evil.</p>
<p>If you spoke words of truth,</p>
<p>Why have the mantras not borne fruit?</p>
<p>“People superior, middling, and inferior have practiced,</p>
<p>But even still have found no results through mantra.</p>
<p>If preparatory rites accomplish nothing at all,</p>
<p>Accomplishment is only affliction, so what is the point?</p>
<p>“If the Victor previously taught</p>
<p>Pacifying wisdom to soothe afflictions,</p>
<p>How then are they relieved</p>
<p>When mantra and vidyā are not mastered?</p>
<p>“Out of compassion you explained</p>
<p>Myriad mantras meant to heal beings.</p>
<p>How could they not be accomplished,</p>
<p>Through recitation, homa, the observances, and preparatory rites?</p>
<p>“Are the rites corrupt or devoid of power?</p>
<p>Was the timing correct? Did evil interfere?</p>
<p>Were the mantras altered? Were the offerings switched?</p>
<p>May the Blessed One tell all, omitting nothing.”</p>
<p>After listening to the words of his child,</p>
<p>The vajra holder reflected for a moment,</p>
<p>Opened his long eyes, brandished a flaming vajra,</p>
<p>And spoke these words:</p>
<p>“Wonderful that you ask these questions that serve beings,</p>
<p>Moved by compassion radiant as moonlight.</p>
<p>With such a pristine state of mind</p>
<p>You will reach perfection among the Sugata’s children.</p>
<p>“Bodhisattvas are not attached to their own happiness,</p>
<p>Nor are they crushed by their own sufferings.</p>
<p>They suffer because others suffer,</p>
<p>And find joy in others’ happiness.</p>
<p>“Child, because of your good nature</p>
<p>You posed these questions to benefit beings.</p>
<p>Quickly then, focus your attention and listen,</p>
<p>As I will answer in accord with the scriptures of mantra.</p>
<p>“I will first explain the observances</p>
<p>For the mantra recitations I previously taught.</p>
<p>A practitioner should first arouse faith in the Sugata,</p>
<p>And with that, arouse bodhicitta.</p>
<p>“They should cast aside greed, arrogance, and conceit,</p>
<p>And faithfully serve the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>They should delight in and have faith in me,</p>
<p>And in what is widely known as the vajra clan.</p>
<p>“They should consistently forsake</p>
<p>Harsh speech, slander, and useless talk,</p>
<p>Visiting the woman of another, lying, stealing,</p>
<p>Killing, doing harm, and using alcohol.</p>
<p>“A deluded person who gathers</p>
<p>The merit of body, speech, and mind</p>
<p>Will destroy it through their wrong views,</p>
<p>And experience the ripening of unwanted results.</p>
<p>“Just as a burnt seed will never produce a sprout,</p>
<p>Even if given soil, water, and time,</p>
<p>A mind ruined by wrong views and ignorance</p>
<p>Will not give rise to virtuous qualities.</p>
<p>“Thus wrong views should be cast aside,</p>
<p>And the correct view adhered to.</p>
<p>It is best if the mind always follows</p>
<p>The Dharma path of the ten virtues.</p>
<p>“Devas, asuras, piśācas, and herukas</p>
<p>And all the terrible creatures of the night</p>
<p>Move through the world harming beings</p>
<p>And distracting those intent on recitation.</p>
<p>“Because they are a countermeasure against them,</p>
<p>When these beings see my collection of mantra and vidyā</p>
<p>They grow anxious, thinking ‘This is terrifying,’</p>
<p>And distract the mind from recitation.</p>
<p>“In the maṇḍalas I have taught</p>
<p>To crush harm-doers and enrich oneself,</p>
<p>Reside devas and asuras who, according to samaya,</p>
<p>Keep watch over meritorious deeds.</p>
<p>“Where the myriad types of grahas are present,</p>
<p>There are maṇḍalas that employ various activities</p>
<p>That are intended to crush these harmful beings.</p>
<p>People should strive hard to enter them.</p>
<p>“They should use the maṇḍalas taught in the Vidyottama Tantra,</p>
<p>As well as the maṇḍalas of wrathful deities.</p>
<p>There I have explained the various samayas,</p>
<p>So study them carefully to dispel evil.</p>
<p>“When they observe the recitation</p>
<p>Of the main goddess of the vajra clan,</p>
<p>Whom the host of dūtīs and the many vidyās serve,</p>
<p>The obstructors will be ruined, filled with fear and rage.</p>
<p>“To the extent one beholds the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>One serves the vajra clan.</p>
<p>The merit of serving the host of vidyās</p>
<p>Causes all their blessings to enter one’s body.</p>
<p>“Devas, nāgas, asuras, yakṣas, and siddhas</p>
<p>Will flee in fear from those reciting,</p>
<p>Upon seeing their invulnerable vajra nature,</p>
<p>And believing the whole area to burn with vajra fire.</p>
<p>“Those of my children who observe samaya</p>
<p>Will easily succeed in using mantras</p>
<p>Taught by the mundane and transcendent;</p>
<p>All obstructors will be brought to ruin.</p>
<p>“If they do not see the vidyā or observe samaya,</p>
<p>If they lack compassion or do not arouse bodhicitta,</p>
<p>If they lack faith in the Buddha and rely on other deities,</p>
<p>Recitation of my mantras will bring them to ruin.</p>
<p>“If those unable to look upon any of these maṇḍalas</p>
<p>Because they are disheartened and lack the means,</p>
<p>Instead view just one among the maṇḍalas with faith</p>
<p>While maintaining their observances,</p>
<p>“The host of yakṣas and creatures of the night,</p>
<p>Nāgas, and all the grahas that float above the ground,</p>
<p>Devas and the like, vighnas, and vināyakas</p>
<p>Will find no chance to harm them.</p>
<p>“Just as any crop depends on its soil</p>
<p>To grow up free from blight,</p>
<p>It is in dependence on discipline</p>
<p>That virtuous deeds grow, watered with compassion.</p>
<p>“From the complete Vinaya, the pure discipline of prātimokṣa,</p>
<p>Taught with certainty by the Victor,</p>
<p>A householder mantrin should abandon the outer signs and rites,</p>
<p>And train in all the rest.</p>
<p>“Thus freed from nonvirtuous dharma,</p>
<p>They are imbued with the Sugata’s eloquent Dharma,</p>
<p>Which is pure and brings liberation.</p>
<p>When weary of recitation, they should read scripture.</p>
<p>“To purify nonvirtue they should continuously erect,</p>
<p>In a clean and secluded place,</p>
<p>Caityas to the Sugata made of either sand or clay</p>
<p>That contain the Essence of Dependent Arising.</p>
<p>“Before relic-filled caityas and statues</p>
<p>They should sing praise and offer fragrances, garlands, and lamps.</p>
<p>With deep faith they should perform worship,</p>
<p>Using parasols, banners, flags, and music.</p>
<p>“A one-wheeled chariot will never move along a path</p>
<p>Even when harnessed to a horse.</p>
<p>Neither will a practitioner lacking an assistant</p>
<p>Gain siddhi in this life.</p>
<p>“Such assistants are intelligent, attractive, and fastidiously clean.</p>
<p>They hail from a venerable line and are inclined toward Dharma.</p>
<p>They are eloquent, courageous, have tamed their senses,</p>
<p>And are pleasant of speech, generous, and compassionate.</p>
<p>“Patient in the face of hunger, thirst, and emotions,</p>
<p>They do not worship brahmins or other gods.</p>
<p>They are enthusiastic, skilled in the arts, talented,</p>
<p>And have faith in the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>“Someone with all these good qualities</p>
<p>Is rare to find in this age of strife.</p>
<p>A mantrin should thus rely on an assistant</p>
<p>With half, a quarter, or even an eighth of these qualities.”</p>
<p>This was the first chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>“Places of pratyekabuddhas and the sugatas’ heirs,</p>
<p>Those where the Victor previously lived,</p>
<p>Places that are pleasant and steeped in merit,</p>
<p>Or venerated by devas and asuras—</p>
<p>These are the places mantrins maintaining poṣadha</p>
<p>Should rely on to purify themselves.</p>
<p>“If such places are not to be found, there are others:</p>
<p>Accessible rivers, brooks, and streams,</p>
<p>Lakes adorned with lotuses and utpalas,</p>
<p>Places unfrequented by people,</p>
<p>Or those abundant with clean water;</p>
<p>Places unknown to terrible grahas;</p>
<p>Those with fresh flowers and fruit,</p>
<p>Rich in medicinal plants, or thick with different trees;</p>
<p>Places with clean spots to sleep upon the ground,</p>
<p>Those free of tiger, leopard, and lion,</p>
<p>Or places pleasing, level, and without brambles—</p>
<p>These are places people celebrate for siddhi.</p>
<p>Avoid places with ravines, anthills, ash, or hair,</p>
<p>Rubbish, charcoal, salt deposits, or excrement.</p>
<p>“The earth should be excavated, and a hut built there,</p>
<p>One that is warm, strong, and plastered with clay.</p>
<p>The door can be to the east, north, or west,</p>
<p>But should never face to the south.</p>
<p>“To one side of the shrine chamber</p>
<p>Hang the cloth image to be used in the rite,</p>
<p>One showing the Victor revealing the sublime path,</p>
<p>Or set out a beautiful wooden image to worship.</p>
<p>“A cloth image will grant a person siddhi</p>
<p>When a weaver weaves it soft and smooth,</p>
<p>When it is tightly woven and free of hairs,</p>
<p>Properly proportioned, undamaged, and with its fringe intact.</p>
<p>“On that cloth, sprinkled with clean, fragrant water,</p>
<p>Persons bathed, clean, and observing poṣadha</p>
<p>Should use pigment from clean pots and free of cow bile</p>
<p>To artfully draw using hair from a cow.</p>
<p>“Abundant offerings should be made to the image:</p>
<p>Offerings of garlands, incense, lamps, food, and fragrance.</p>
<p>It should be set up securely, facing west;</p>
<p>In its presence they begin their quest for siddhi.</p>
<p>“Their hair should be tied in a topknot and shaved,</p>
<p>And the color of their clothes changed with mineral dyes.</p>
<p>They should wear either white garb,</p>
<p>Or clothing made of leaves, hemp, flax, or bark.</p>
<p>“They should hold an attractive alms bowl,</p>
<p>One made from gourd, iron, or clay.</p>
<p>It should be shapely, not rough but smooth,</p>
<p>And be undamaged, round, and free of cracks and holes.</p>
<p>“They should live near a pleasant town, not too close or too far,</p>
<p>Where food and drink are available, and śūdras predominate.</p>
<p>It should be hospitable to guests,</p>
<p>And without brahmins of other traditions.</p>
<p>“Brahmins overcome with pride</p>
<p>Are arrogant about their lineage and lack compassion.</p>
<p>They create problems whenever they see</p>
<p>People worshiping at shrines to the Sugata.</p>
<p>“How are brahmins inferior to the Buddha’s followers?</p>
<p>They say, ‘Those of the śūdra caste</p>
<p>Exist to serve and venerate brahmins.</p>
<p>How could śūdras ever be fit to recite mantra?</p>
<p>“ ‘We worship gods and guests, perform the six activities,</p>
<p>Serve the king and the god of fire,</p>
<p>And do what we must for our sons—</p>
<p>This is what concerns brahmins.</p>
<p>“ ‘Kṣatriyas and vaiśyas also do their duty,</p>
<p>Therefore do not harbor any doubt.’</p>
<p>Speaking a slew of deceptive fallacies,</p>
<p>They burn their minds and the minds of others.</p>
<p>“Upholders of the eightfold path</p>
<p>Should always take their food before noon.</p>
<p>Brahmins eat in the afternoon,</p>
<p>So do not visit a brahmin’s home then.</p>
<p>“For those who understand virtue and nonvirtue,</p>
<p>There is no difference between a brahmin and a śūdra.</p>
<p>A person may think, ‘This is a brahmin, this is a śūdra,’</p>
<p>But those are concepts, nothing more.</p>
<p>“By focusing on the true path and following virtue,</p>
<p>Śūdras too will pass beyond aging and death.</p>
<p>By following a false path and behaving badly,</p>
<p>Brahmins too will fall into unbearable hells.</p>
<p>“Those who are embodied, rife with impurity</p>
<p>Cannot now be made pure by some other means.</p>
<p>They are cleansed by ridding themselves of evil,</p>
<p>And embracing only the meritorious.</p>
<p>“Just as medicines are given to the ill</p>
<p>To allay and heal their ailments,</p>
<p>The Victor taught that eating food</p>
<p>Is meant to dispel the pains of hunger.</p>
<p>“Base-minded yogis should not eat</p>
<p>While obsessed with their longevity,</p>
<p>As if a weary traveler beset with hunger and thirst,</p>
<p>Who consumes the flesh of their own child.</p>
<p>“When too much is added, a scale rises effortlessly;</p>
<p>Too little and it likewise falls.</p>
<p>When proportionate, it instantly comes into balance—</p>
<p>This is how an embodied being should eat their food.</p>
<p>“A person will set a sturdy pillar, for example,</p>
<p>To keep an old house from collapsing.</p>
<p>So too food stabilizes the machine of the body,</p>
<p>And is like grease for a chariot’s axle.</p>
<p>“ ‘Food perpetuates the desire realm’—</p>
<p>So said the Victor in one of his teachings.</p>
<p>One should know the body to be like a plantain tree;</p>
<p>Thus the mind should not desire food, drink, and the like.</p>
<p>“Using knowledge gained from the words of the Sugata,</p>
<p>One should guard against the interactions of the six senses and sense objects.</p>
<p>Taking up one of the various kinds of alms bowls,</p>
<p>One should go for alms, gazing a plow’s length ahead.</p>
<p>“Smiling as she walks, speaking with sidelong glances,</p>
<p>Her shapely body captivates the mind—</p>
<p>A woman’s body strikes like a weapon,</p>
<p>Stealing away men’s minds.</p>
<p>“Better that he covers his eyes</p>
<p>With a red-hot iron plowshare</p>
<p>Than to look upon the long eyes of a woman,</p>
<p>Which cause his mindfulness to come undone.</p>
<p>“One goes where they please, free of clinging.</p>
<p>With their minds mentally disciplined,</p>
<p>Rejecting concerns of high, middling, or otherwise,</p>
<p>They go to other people’s homes in silence.</p>
<p>“Wherever there are calves and young cows,</p>
<p>Wherever people are drinking alcohol,</p>
<p>Wherever young women serve and play,</p>
<p>Wherever young men sport,</p>
<p>“At any feast where dog meat is served,</p>
<p>Wherever many people gather,</p>
<p>And wherever music is played,</p>
<p>There a person should never go.</p>
<p>“They should return bringing all the alms received,</p>
<p>And share the first portion as they please.</p>
<p>After washing their feet, they should give some to guests,</p>
<p>Then eat the food to care for their body.</p>
<p>“After eating at the appropriate time and bathing on the three occasions,</p>
<p>They should make offerings of garlands, lamps, and incense,</p>
<p>Sing praises, and present food that is free of meat and alcohol.</p>
<p>Mantrins then sit on a mat of kuśa grass and recite.</p>
<p>“If incense, fragrant unguents, and the rest are not available,</p>
<p>They should offer a variety of fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>But avoid buka, arka bilva, bṛhatī, and kuśa,</p>
<p>As they smell bad and are unappealing.</p>
<p>“When standing, seated, lying down, or asleep,</p>
<p>Or when moving, reclining, eating, reading, and reciting,</p>
<p>They should bring to mind the six recollections,</p>
<p>Remaining aware of their respective qualities.”</p>
<p>This was the second chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>“Beset with the host of afflictions, desire and the like,</p>
<p>The mind itself is said to be saṃsāra.</p>
<p>When free of affliction, when crystalline and moon-like,</p>
<p>It is declared the end of the ocean of existence.</p>
<p>“In the same way that, for example, clean water</p>
<p>Is instantly polluted by dirt and the like,</p>
<p>So too the pure, pristine mind</p>
<p>Is polluted by the faults of desire and the like.</p>
<p>“One should select a mālā</p>
<p>With 108 beads of bodhi seed,</p>
<p>Conch, crystal, rūdrākṣa, soapberry,</p>
<p>Lotus seed, lead, copper, or bronze.</p>
<p>“Holding it carefully in their left hand,</p>
<p>Or gripping it carefully in their right,</p>
<p>Mantrins should complete their recitation,</p>
<p>Counting the beads gradually, one by one.</p>
<p>“Once seated, with senses restrained,</p>
<p>Their body straight and steady,</p>
<p>They should move their lower lip gently</p>
<p>To recite the mantra of their choice.</p>
<p>“The mind is like lightning, clouds, and the wind;</p>
<p>It is similar to waves upon the great ocean.</p>
<p>It is deceptive and delights in desirable things;</p>
<p>It wavers and wanders and needs to be tamed.</p>
<p>“Delighting in recitation, the mind is at peace,</p>
<p>But should it lead to a dull state of drowsiness,</p>
<p>Mantrins should stand, move, look around,</p>
<p>And splash water on their face.</p>
<p>“Impelled by past actions</p>
<p>Without master, protector, or support,</p>
<p>Moving from life to life in a succession of bodies,</p>
<p>Aligned with virtue and nonvirtue,</p>
<p>“Filled with longing, separated from kith and kin,</p>
<p>Meeting with unpleasantness, beset with desire,</p>
<p>Suffering from adversity and birth, old age, sickness, and death—</p>
<p>No one lacks these, no matter where they are.</p>
<p>“Stinging bugs, heat, cold, hunger, fatigue—</p>
<p>No matter where one goes such miseries persist.</p>
<p>Thus, when the mind feels delight for an object,</p>
<p>Use these ideas to ward it off:</p>
<p>“Repel strong desire by noting the impurity</p>
<p>Of muscle, fat, skin, and bones.</p>
<p>Douse anger with the water of affection and compassion,</p>
<p>And against stupidity use the path of interdependence.</p>
<p>“Enemies suddenly become friends,</p>
<p>And friends change into enemies.</p>
<p>Likewise, some will become neutral,</p>
<p>And the neutral change into enemies.</p>
<p>“One should know that relationships change—</p>
<p>A rational person should not become attached.</p>
<p>Warding off affectionate feelings for relations,</p>
<p>One should rest easily in virtue.</p>
<p>“Once recitation begins, and until it is finished,</p>
<p>Mantrins should not speak with brahmins,</p>
<p>Not with kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, or farmers,</p>
<p>Nor with women, paṇḍakas, or young boys and girls.</p>
<p>“They can speak as needed with their attendant,</p>
<p>And can talk a little once recitation is complete.</p>
<p>After speaking, and after expelling mucus, feces, or urine,</p>
<p>They should immerse themselves in water to bathe.</p>
<p>“To the highest awakening of the unexcelled buddhas</p>
<p>They should make lofty dedications of all their virtue</p>
<p>Accrued through offerings of flowers, bowls of fragrance, and lamps,</p>
<p>And through their discipline, diligence, and austerities.</p>
<p>“Just as, for example, a river that reaches the sea</p>
<p>Merges with it and takes on the taste of salt,</p>
<p>So too merit dedicated to the highest awakening</p>
<p>Becomes one with it, and takes on the flavor of the victors.</p>
<p>“As an analogy, a person will grow rice</p>
<p>For the sake of its grain, not for its straw.</p>
<p>And yet, when harvesting their rice,</p>
<p>They effortlessly and incidentally gain bundles of straw.</p>
<p>“Similarly, merit is cultivated not for pleasure,</p>
<p>But out of desire for the fruit of awakening.</p>
<p>And yet, it brings people pleasure</p>
<p>As effortlessly as gaining those bundles of straw.</p>
<p>“They should dedicate to obtain a long life,</p>
<p>To find places conducive to the Dharma,</p>
<p>To freedom from weariness,</p>
<p>And to always fulfill the hopes of beings.</p>
<p>“They should mentally thwart the worldly concerns—</p>
<p>Fame and infamy, gain and loss,</p>
<p>Happiness and misery, and praise and blame—</p>
<p>And avoid any evil states.</p>
<p>“Just as, for example, a human corpse</p>
<p>Will not stay beneath the ocean for even an instant,</p>
<p>So too mantrins should not spend even a moment</p>
<p>Creating evil with their conceptual mind.</p>
<p>“Just as, for example, inside a windless house</p>
<p>A lamp will not flicker but burn brightly,</p>
<p>So too the Dharma will shine brightly</p>
<p>In the body of one who delights in focused recitation.</p>
<p>“Abstain from posturing, jumping about, dancing,</p>
<p>Singing, beating drums, and earning people’s derision.</p>
<p>Avoid arrogance, deception, and excessive desire,</p>
<p>As well as gambling and seeking social events.</p>
<p>“Give up ill-timed sleep, pointless talk,</p>
<p>Reading and reciting literature or false treatises,</p>
<p>Attachment, spite, haughtiness, and conceit,</p>
<p>As well as resentment, laziness, and cunning.</p>
<p>“Do not consume meat or alcohol,</p>
<p>Garlic, wild garlic, or onions,</p>
<p>Grain oil, sesame, radishes, or yams,</p>
<p>Or food for bhūtas, food offerings, or oblations to Paśupati.</p>
<p>“I have said that a mantrin should consume</p>
<p>The three white foods, roots, stalks, fruits, and vegetables,</p>
<p>Yogurt, barley, milk, and ghee,</p>
<p>Oil cakes, buttermilk, boiled milk, and broth.</p>
<p>“For the subduing of piśācas and rākṣasas,</p>
<p>Of ostārakas, vetālas, and masters of terror,</p>
<p>Or of an asurī’s magical device,</p>
<p>I have praised oil cakes as the best food.</p>
<p>“Practitioners engaged in such recitation</p>
<p>Should, after a day full of activity, offer recitation,</p>
<p>Request departure as the ritual specifies,</p>
<p>Then lay down at night upon a spread of kuśa grass.</p>
<p>“Full of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity,</p>
<p>They should bring to mind the Sugata, Dharma, and Saṅgha,</p>
<p>Join their palms, bow to me and Śāriputra, and sleep;</p>
<p>This is how mantrins should fully exhaust their evil.”</p>
<p>This was the third chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>“Next to be explained are the vajras</p>
<p>A practitioner should be sure to wield.</p>
<p>They can measure ten, twelve, sixteen, or eighteen finger-widths,</p>
<p>But the best measures twenty finger-widths.</p>
<p>“Gold vajras are recommended to obtain</p>
<p>The state of a vidyādhara, or any lands.</p>
<p>Silver is the best for kingship,</p>
<p>While copper is for nāgas, the source of jewels.</p>
<p>“To destroy the magical devices of asura lords,</p>
<p>Or enter openings in the earth, use a stone vajra.</p>
<p>For success in all aims, a triple-alloy is best,</p>
<p>While iron is used to smash guhyaka armies.</p>
<p>“For other malevolent forces use khadira wood;</p>
<p>Use bilva for glory, prosperity, health, and riches;</p>
<p>For success with yakṣas and mātṛkās use madu wood;</p>
<p>And for the Dharma, one made of aśvattha is recommended.</p>
<p>“Use human bone to assail murderers,</p>
<p>And enemies wielding sharp spears.</p>
<p>Use one made of crystal for great illusions,</p>
<p>While one made of neem is recommended for separation.</p>
<p>“To kill or desiccate use beleric myrobalan,</p>
<p>Which is always good for success with piśācas too.</p>
<p>For success with devas, yakṣas, and gandharvas</p>
<p>Use a vajra made from cedar.</p>
<p>“If mastery over nāgas is desired,</p>
<p>Use one made from the root of a nāga tree.</p>
<p>For shapeshifting use one made of earth,</p>
<p>And for success with vetālas, use kadamba wood.</p>
<p>“For wealth use a vajra made of punnāga wood,</p>
<p>Or the wood of rājārka or the aśvattha tree.</p>
<p>One made of glavāmraśivarṇava, arjuna tree, or the like</p>
<p>Is used for victory when battling humans.</p>
<p>“To attain anything pleasing and desirable</p>
<p>Use a vajra made of white or red sandalwood.</p>
<p>One should wield a vajra that is solid and five-pronged,</p>
<p>Well formed, smooth, and free of wear.</p>
<p>“When recitation begins, pick the vajra up;</p>
<p>When complete, immediately bow with faith,</p>
<p>Make offerings of fragrance and the like,</p>
<p>And place the vajra at the Victor’s feet.</p>
<p>“Anyone practicing the mantras of my clan</p>
<p>Will not succeed without a vajra.</p>
<p>Those who cannot find one</p>
<p>Should make a fist and recite with focus.</p>
<p>“Realgar, bovine bezoar, a sword, collyrium,</p>
<p>Copper sulfate, yellow orpiment, a noose, vermillion,</p>
<p>Ochre, ghee, calamus, a wheel, a vajra,</p>
<p>A spear, skin, armor, and a trident—</p>
<p>“These seventeen renowned substances</p>
<p>Bring the attainment of the three kinds of siddhi.</p>
<p>Look to the explanations in your own mantra rituals</p>
<p>To learn about the three kinds of siddhi.</p>
<p>“Vighnas and vināyakas who dislike siddhis</p>
<p>Flit about the host of vidyās,</p>
<p>Seeking myriad ways</p>
<p>to thwart industrious vidyādharas.</p>
<p>“There are four clans of vighnas,</p>
<p>Of vināyakas arrayed upon the earth:</p>
<p>The destroyer, jackal, mongoose, and one-tooth clans.</p>
<p>Limitless are these four and their emanations.</p>
<p>“Upon the earth are the four world guardians,</p>
<p>In whose retinue is found Aśoka.</p>
<p>Their retinue, numbering seventy million,</p>
<p>Creates obstacles for practitioners of mantra.</p>
<p>“The jackal clan numbers 180 million,</p>
<p>And serves as the retinue of Maheśvara.</p>
<p>Their general is the mighty Gajamukha,</p>
<p>And together they create obstacles all over the earth.</p>
<p>“The general of the one-tooth clan is Dangling Locks,</p>
<p>Who controls sixty million vināyakas.</p>
<p>With Brahmā, Indra, Viṣṇu, Sūrya, Candra, and Vāyu</p>
<p>They create obstacles for instruction and mantra.</p>
<p>“The mongoose clan is vast,</p>
<p>Numbering thousands of millions of billions.</p>
<p>With their general, Born from a Topknot,</p>
<p>They create obstacles for my clan and mantras.</p>
<p>“Nandika, with long, lotus-like eyes,</p>
<p>And Pāñcika create obstacles for the mantra lineage.</p>
<p>The son of Maṇicara and father of Pūrṇa</p>
<p>Also create obstacles for one’s own mantra line.</p>
<p>“Unhappy with practitioners’ wealth and bereft of kindness,</p>
<p>They create obstacles according to their respective clans.</p>
<p>They take the form of one’s own mantra deities</p>
<p>And abscond with garlands and oblations.</p>
<p>“Seeing what the vināyakas, as deities, have done,</p>
<p>A mantrin will grow angry and turn away in disgust.</p>
<p>Motivated as they are by avarice and delusion,</p>
<p>Vighnas and vināyakas devise this way of appearing as a deity.</p>
<p>“No deva, nāga, or siddha can undermine this,</p>
<p>Not even the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p>The terror wrought by vināyakas</p>
<p>Can be overcome by what I have already taught.</p>
<p>“When recitation is complete, rites of protection should be performed,</p>
<p>The maṇḍala rites repeated, and the maṇḍala entered.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in the absence of a rite of worship,</p>
<p>And lacking rites for recitation and homa,</p>
<p>A person will constantly wonder,</p>
<p>‘Which vidyā should I recite?’</p>
<p>“Fixated on tales of kings, kingdoms, and the like,</p>
<p>The body becomes easy to possess.</p>
<p>Pulled here and there in this way,</p>
<p>The mind that chants vidyā is led to distraction.</p>
<p>“Like a shadow falling on water,</p>
<p>Vighnas enter a person’s body.</p>
<p>They enter some when bathing,</p>
<p>Some when reciting,</p>
<p>And some when sleeping.</p>
<p>They enter some when offering</p>
<p>Flowers, fragrance, and lamps,</p>
<p>And some when performing homa.</p>
<p>“Just as, for example, a sunstone charged with sunlight</p>
<p>Produces fire without need for specific conditions,</p>
<p>So a vighna can enter the body</p>
<p>And spark the intense fire of passion.</p>
<p>“The vighnas named shaking and trembling</p>
<p>Take hold when a person is bathing in water.</p>
<p>They cause hunger, fatigue, and deep sleep,</p>
<p>As well as lethargy and anger in the extreme.</p>
<p>“Likewise, the vighnas called gandharvas</p>
<p>Enter the body when fragrance is offered.</p>
<p>People dream of kings, kingdoms, family, and wealth;</p>
<p>They grow fatigued and become fixated on women.</p>
<p>“A being with a large black body will burst from the earth</p>
<p>And enter a person’s body during offerings of incense.</p>
<p>Acting wickedly, it incites avarice and deceit,</p>
<p>And terrorizes those with strong desire so that semen spills.</p>
<p>“One-Braid will create obstacles during lamp offerings,</p>
<p>Causing heat in the heart, sharp pain, and mental decline.</p>
<p>Dangling Locks enters when a person is standing,</p>
<p>Inflicting intense fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.</p>
<p>“Great Flower Array will find a chance</p>
<p>To enter the body while one offers flowers.</p>
<p>He will cause fevers, colds, and joint pain,</p>
<p>As well as separation from companions.</p>
<p>“Those who are possessed by a vighna</p>
<p>Take what is not the path as the path.</p>
<p>They are wracked with desire, behave erratically,</p>
<p>Speak impulsively, and stumble profitlessly through their readings.</p>
<p>“Those with purpose are rendered ambivalent.</p>
<p>With their minds overcome by wrong view,</p>
<p>They constantly say frivolous things like,</p>
<p>‘There is no mantra, there are no heavens,</p>
<p>There is no merit nor the slightest evil,</p>
<p>There is no liberation, and no cause of bondage.</p>
<p>Life is pointless, rife with afflictions, and a hardship.’</p>
<p>“Those who are possessed pick at grass with their nails,</p>
<p>Smash dirt clods, and grind their teeth at night.</p>
<p>Also possessed are women who want a spouse but find none,</p>
<p>Men who want a spouse but find none,</p>
<p>People who ignore the meaningful and do what is not,</p>
<p>And those who go where they please and never sleep.</p>
<p>“Also possessed are those who dream</p>
<p>Of tigers, leopards, lions, dogs, or pigs;</p>
<p>Of donkeys, camels, cats, or flesh-eating jackals;</p>
<p>Of vultures, owls, herons, small people, or snakes;</p>
<p>Of people who are naked, ash-covered, or black-colored;</p>
<p>Of dry wells or heaps of skulls and bones;</p>
<p>Of iron, stone quarries, or houses old and unclean;</p>
<p>Or of changing faces or of people bearing swords and spears.</p>
<p>“Carry out the ritual activities of fierce Amṛtakuṇḍalin</p>
<p>To destroy these vighnas and vināyakas.</p>
<p>Mantrins who follow the path of his mantra,</p>
<p>Are not vulnerable to vighnas and vināyakas.</p>
<p>“At a solitary tree, in a cattle pen or shrine,</p>
<p>At a crossroads, empty house, or in a forest,</p>
<p>Use a variety of paints to draw a maṇḍala,</p>
<p>One that is four cubits square.</p>
<p>“Surround it with places for the directional deities,</p>
<p>And spread kuśa grass at the four gates.</p>
<p>Present many oblations of fruit and cooked grain,</p>
<p>Along with other food, meat, alcohol, radishes, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Take four vases that are the color of a red lotus,</p>
<p>Unblemished, and adorned with jewels,</p>
<p>Fill them with medicines, grain, and fragrant water,</p>
<p>Adorn their mouths with stalks, and tie cloth around their necks.</p>
<p>“After reciting one hundred recitations</p>
<p>Of the mantras for Raktāṅga, Kīlikīla, Dramiḍa, and so forth,</p>
<p>Place the vases around the maṇḍala</p>
<p>And make offerings of fragrant unguents, incense, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Place someone possessed by a vighna in the center of the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>On a comfortable seat that faces toward the east.</p>
<p>Once the mantra is recited and they are washed with each vase,</p>
<p>They are thereby freed from the vināyaka.</p>
<p>“Destroying vighnas is not only of benefit</p>
<p>To people who are practitioners.</p>
<p>It is also suitable for the royal court and childless women,</p>
<p>For young women and musicians,</p>
<p>Sex workers and merchants,</p>
<p>Farmers, the poor and destitute,</p>
<p>Those seized by grahas and those stricken with fever,</p>
<p>Young grahas, and those who steal flowers and fruit.</p>
<p>This washing brings purity;</p>
<p>It clears away poison, nightmares, and distractions.”</p>
<p>This was the fourth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>“Vighnas exhaust all merit,</p>
<p>So that people do not succeed in mantra.</p>
<p>Those freed from vighnas shine,</p>
<p>Like the moon emerging from a cloud.</p>
<p>“Just as no fruit, flower, or sprout will grow from a vase</p>
<p>Without soil and water, or out of season.</p>
<p>Sprouts, leaves, stalks, flowers, and fruit</p>
<p>Will grow when such conditions are present.</p>
<p>“When the rites are corrupted, vowels and syllables missing,</p>
<p>Offerings are lacking, recitation is sloppy,</p>
<p>Or when vowels and syllables are added,</p>
<p>Mantras will not grant abundant siddhi.</p>
<p>“The rain clouds of summer, for example,</p>
<p>Release rain favorably according to people’s fortune.</p>
<p>So, too, it is in light of a person’s fortune</p>
<p>That mantras bestow the desired siddhi.</p>
<p>“Seeing the proper time, place, and ritual steps,</p>
<p>Seeing that evil is cleansed and merit gathered,</p>
<p>Seeing proper respect and complete recitation,</p>
<p>Mantras will then bestow their fruits.</p>
<p>“The extent to which mantrins are suffused with evil,</p>
<p>The extent to which they do not gather merit and pure deeds,</p>
<p>And the degree to which they recite without proper rites,</p>
<p>To that degree they will not receive the siddhis.</p>
<p>“Should a rite be corrupted or interrupted, a different mantra recited,</p>
<p>Recitation abandoned or dedicated to a different purpose,</p>
<p>Then worship should be made fervently three times a day</p>
<p>And another hundred thousand recitations completed.</p>
<p>“After ten, eight, seven, or four thousand recitations,</p>
<p>They should perform a homa using ghee,</p>
<p>Or perform a homa using a mixture of ghee</p>
<p>And whole barley, black sesame, or mustard seeds.</p>
<p>“Locate fresh wood for the homa that is twelve finger-widths long.</p>
<p>It can be rose apple, madu, plakṣa, palāśa,</p>
<p>Uḍumbara, khadira, aśvattha, apamara,</p>
<p>Arka, aśoka, rājārka,</p>
<p>Nyagrodha, bilva, or amraśa.</p>
<p>Smear them with yogurt, ghee, and honey,</p>
<p>And continuously offer them into the fire as homa.</p>
<p>Doing this, the siddhis are quickly attained.</p>
<p>“If it seems that a mantra</p>
<p>Has been disrupted, restricted, or suppressed by another mantra,</p>
<p>Make an effigy of it from clay</p>
<p>And place it before my feet.</p>
<p>“The mantrin should use an essence mantra such as Kīlikīla,</p>
<p>While washing the effigy with milk and ghee.</p>
<p>After doing this for seven days the mantras will be freed</p>
<p>From all restrictions and suppressions.</p>
<p>“If the rites of worship and so forth are complete,</p>
<p>But the mantra still does not bear fruit,</p>
<p>Anoint an effigy with poison and black mustard seed,</p>
<p>And recite the Kīlikīla, Dramiḍa, or similar mantra.</p>
<p>“Using the mantra along with mustard oil and salt,</p>
<p>Perform a homa three times a day for seven days.</p>
<p>The mantra deity will then appear in a dream</p>
<p>To reveal the corrupted rite, or the syllables added or omitted.</p>
<p>“I have already taught about upholding the way of mantra:</p>
<p>Just as ocean tides never fail,</p>
<p>Mantras should never be used to suppress another mantra,</p>
<p>Nor to restrict or disrupt it.</p>
<p>“A loved one might tell a person,</p>
<p>‘You shouldn’t visit so-and-so’s house anymore,</p>
<p>Even just to look,’ and present them with good reasons.</p>
<p>That person, hearing what they have to say,</p>
<p>Will not go there for conversation or even to look.</p>
<p>So too mantrins should never</p>
<p>Recite any mantra to suppress the mantra of another.</p>
<p>“They should not disrupt or restrict a mantra,</p>
<p>Nor should they add or omit mantra syllables.</p>
<p>They should not change the purpose of a rite</p>
<p>And should never torment local beings.</p>
<p>“Mantrins should possess,</p>
<p>Restrain, strike, and confuse,</p>
<p>But not crush limbs nor bring a family to ruin.</p>
<p>They should not banish nāgas,</p>
<p>Nor grahas, nor other similar beings.</p>
<p>“They should not eradicate, banish, or kill,</p>
<p>Nor fail to heal a child possessed by grahas.</p>
<p>They should never use nets, traps, snares, or decoys</p>
<p>To cause harm to any being.</p>
<p>“It is said there are ten requisites for siddhi:</p>
<p>The mantrin, their mantra, an attendant, a ritual substance,</p>
<p>Perseverance, a direction, a site, time,</p>
<p>A deity with complete iconography, and mental fortitude.</p>
<p>“Others speak of the vidyādhara and assistant,</p>
<p>Others specifically of the direction, perseverance, and time,</p>
<p>Yet others say they are the ritual substance, site, deity, and mantra,</p>
<p>And some say it is mental fortitude.</p>
<p>“Each explains the science of mantra according to their own understanding,</p>
<p>Stating that success requires ten, eight, or five,</p>
<p>Or that it requires four, three, or only one.</p>
<p>But in the tantras, buddhahood is reached through two rites.</p>
<p>“Practitioners perfect their own qualities;</p>
<p>They maintain the strongest perseverance,</p>
<p>Feel no envy toward another’s gain,</p>
<p>Desire nothing, and tolerate physical affliction.</p>
<p>“With a proper rite and clear mantra—</p>
<p>With vowels, nasalizations, and punctuation complete and clear—</p>
<p>Recitation in places frequented by buddhas and bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Brings the most wondrous of siddhis.</p>
<p>“Just as the king of beasts, when hungry,</p>
<p>Uses its great might to slay an elephant,</p>
<p>And likewise can swiftly kill wolves,</p>
<p>As well as pigs, deer, and jackals,</p>
<p>“So a mantrin, in a leonine way,</p>
<p>Has great perseverance</p>
<p>And draws upon the highest effort,</p>
<p>In activities high, middling, and low.</p>
<p>“The sound of clay drums, conches, and other drums;</p>
<p>The fearful sounds that humans make;</p>
<p>Peals of laughter, whistled tunes, sounds of song and dance;</p>
<p>Flutes, vīnās, and large clay drums as well;</p>
<p>“Chirping flocks of different birds, the sound of water,</p>
<p>And the tinkling sound of women’s jewelry;</p>
<p>And the harms of biting insects, heat, cold, and wind—</p>
<p>These distract and agitate a person’s mind.</p>
<p>“Recitation should be neither quick nor slow</p>
<p>It should be neither loud nor too soft.</p>
<p>It should not be done while conversing or distracted,</p>
<p>And the vowels, nasalizations, and punctuation should be correct.</p>
<p>“Just as the water of a river flows</p>
<p>Continuously, all day and all night,</p>
<p>So the merit of embodied beings increases</p>
<p>Through reverence, recitation, and observances.</p>
<p>“A lazy, desirous, nonvirtuous mind,</p>
<p>Distractedly wandering here and there,</p>
<p>Is swiftly reined in from wherever it was</p>
<p>To prepare an offering of the mantra’s syllables.</p>
<p>“One focuses on the tip of the nose and gives up thoughts.</p>
<p>Even when there is movement, one remain undistracted.</p>
<p>One has then reached stability on the object,</p>
<p>Certain that the mind is now poised and ready.</p>
<p>“A person with a focused mind</p>
<p>Experiences joy arising in the mind,</p>
<p>A joy that brings about a pliant body,</p>
<p>A pliant body that brings a wealth of happiness.</p>
<p>“Through physical ease, a focused mind, and samādhi</p>
<p>Recitation becomes unhindered.</p>
<p>Completing the recitation entirely purifies</p>
<p>Any evil done in previous lives.</p>
<p>“Once recitation has purified all evil,</p>
<p>The mind, now clear, will attain siddhis.</p>
<p>This why the blessed Lord of Victors said,</p>
<p>‘The mind is the root of all these phenomena.’</p>
<p>“The clear mind gains happiness both human and divine,</p>
<p>As well as of the heavens and the liberation of awakening.</p>
<p>The faults of mind bring birth among animals,</p>
<p>Among the hells, or among the ugly and destitute.</p>
<p>“A person whose mind has cleared</p>
<p>Avoids all harm, in the middle and end,</p>
<p>From earth, water, fire, aging, sickness, death, and the rest,</p>
<p>And attains the happiness and peace of liberation.</p>
<p>“The mantra siddhis that are common to all—</p>
<p>Which bring limited happiness and myriad sufferings,</p>
<p>And are fleeting and rife with toxic afflictions—</p>
<p>Are obtained with a clear mind.</p>
<p>“Beings do not arise at random, not from time,</p>
<p>Nor do they arise from prakṛti or a powerful god.</p>
<p>They do not arise without cause nor are they made by a person.</p>
<p>Beings arise from karma and the afflictive emotions.</p>
<p>“Matter consists of the four major elements,</p>
<p>But it is not the self, and the self is not matter.</p>
<p>There is no self in matter, and no matter in the self.</p>
<p>Matter is empty—know this about the other four aggregates as well.</p>
<p>“Matter is like foam;</p>
<p>Sensations are impermanent, like bubbles.</p>
<p>To see them this way is said to be an excellent view;</p>
<p>To regard them otherwise is said to be a poor view.</p>
<p>“As the time of mantra recitation draws near,</p>
<p>One will see the following at night, in dreams:</p>
<p>A mansion, a tree, a banner, a lion, or a horse,</p>
<p>A mountain, a chariot, a thundercloud, or a nāga.</p>
<p>“One may dream of joyfully riding</p>
<p>A tiger, rhinoceros, elephant, or bull,</p>
<p>Or of flower garlands, clothing, fragrances,</p>
<p>Meat, alcohol, fish, fruit, or books.</p>
<p>“One may dream of a divine form or a red utpala,</p>
<p>Of a milk-cow and calf, a loaded chariot,</p>
<p>A white parasol, fly whisk, shoes, or a sword,</p>
<p>A fan of gold and turquoise, or a mālā.</p>
<p>“One may dream of jewels, pearls, mother-of-pearl, conch, or silver,</p>
<p>Of a beautiful woman or a lovely young girl,</p>
<p>Of an ornament bedecked with a variety of jewels,</p>
<p>Or of discovering a white bedspread.</p>
<p>“At the break of dawn one may dream of a river or stream,</p>
<p>Of a waterfall, ocean, or pond,</p>
<p>Of drinking from or swimming in a pool,</p>
<p>Or of bathing one’s body in blood.</p>
<p>“One may dream of an image of the Victor in a shrine or caitya,</p>
<p>Of a sublime bodhisattva or a pratyekabuddha,</p>
<p>Of the undefiled community of monks, nuns, and laypeople,</p>
<p>Or of the deities who rule the area.</p>
<p>“One may dream of a pleasant brahmin man, worthy of worship,</p>
<p>Or of fire, an eminent person, or a young man wealthy and prosperous,</p>
<p>Or of one’s parent, friends, kin, or a yakṣa,</p>
<p>Or of a powerful deity or a gathering of youths.</p>
<p>“One may dream one is eating the sun and moon,</p>
<p>Moving within the earth, drinking a seed,</p>
<p>Walking on fire, eating meat,</p>
<p>Or that a fire burns within one’s body.</p>
<p>“Those who have these excellent dreams</p>
<p>Will reach attainment before too long;</p>
<p>In a month, half a month, one day,</p>
<p>Or a single moment, ever do they draw nearer.”</p>
<p>This was the fifth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>“As the siddhis near, the mind delights in recitation</p>
<p>And takes no joy in evil.</p>
<p>It never wavers, even when beset with severe sufferings</p>
<p>Such as hunger and thirst, heat, cold, wind, and weariness.</p>
<p>“One is not menaced by bees, biting flies, worms, or ants,</p>
<p>By reptiles, centipedes, snakes, or bears,</p>
<p>Or by piśācas and pūtanas—</p>
<p>Not even by their shadows.</p>
<p>“Mantrins’ words will be memorable, their minds keen;</p>
<p>They will be skilled in literature and the art of inquiry.</p>
<p>They will take joy in the Dharma, perceive hidden treasures,</p>
<p>And their bodies will be free of illness and odor.</p>
<p>“When a person so much as sees or hears them</p>
<p>They will be immediately filled with joy.</p>
<p>Women who beguile even the devas of the desire realm</p>
<p>Will invite them to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>“Whenever a learned person feels delight</p>
<p>In seeing or hearing the forms and voices</p>
<p>Of devas, yakṣas, gandharvas, or apsarases,</p>
<p>At that moment the siddhis are close at hand.</p>
<p>“Recognizing their bodies as stainless and pure,</p>
<p>One who maintains the poṣadha vows,</p>
<p>should give up food and maintain a fast</p>
<p>For one day, two days, or even three.</p>
<p>Once those days have passed,</p>
<p>They should begin to practice for their own prosperity.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Subāhu raised another question:</p>
<p>“It has been said that food does not purify.</p>
<p>Why then, venerable one, have you said</p>
<p>We should endure fasts to purify the body?</p>
<p>For what reason did the Sugata, who reached the end of existence,</p>
<p>Say that one can even eat a chariot’s axle grease?”</p>
<p>The vajra bearer, hearing Subāhu’s words,</p>
<p>Spoke with a voice that rumbled like thunder:</p>
<p>“Only son, though the Sugata never taught</p>
<p>Fasting to purify the body, the body is unclean.</p>
<p>“It is flesh, muscle, blood, marrow,</p>
<p>Brain, intestines, spleen, liver, kidneys,</p>
<p>Fat, bile, phlegm, sexual fluids, feces,</p>
<p>Urine, snot, head hair, body hair, and bone.</p>
<p>It has eyes, ears, a nose, and mouth,</p>
<p>An anus and sex organs—nine orifices in all,</p>
<p>Holes from which myriad impurities</p>
<p>Constantly ooze in streams.</p>
<p>“The collection of all these parts,</p>
<p>Made of earth, water, fire, wind, and space,</p>
<p>Comprises the material for the whole human body,</p>
<p>In accordance with the specifics of karma.</p>
<p>“Fasting is said to rid the body</p>
<p>Of its feces, urine, snot, saliva, and phlegm.</p>
<p>The body is pure when rid of these pollutants,</p>
<p>Making it is easy to accomplish one’s prosperity.</p>
<p>“Should one be tormented by desire,</p>
<p>Concentrate the mind and reflect</p>
<p>On all these different parts of the body,</p>
<p>Examining each with the eye of wisdom.</p>
<p>“After such conclusive self-examination,</p>
<p>The desire to fixate on one’s body and health</p>
<p>Will be utterly uprooted and pacified,</p>
<p>Just as the sun fully dispels darkness.</p>
<p>“After preparing for mantra with these beneficial practices,</p>
<p>Mantrins, now aware of their own body,</p>
<p>Should begin their recitation on the fifteenth,</p>
<p>Eighth, or fourteenth day of the waxing moon.</p>
<p>“To prepare the ground where the deity will rest,</p>
<p>They smear it with a mixture of soil, cow dung, and so forth.</p>
<p>With faith they make offerings to all the sugatas,</p>
<p>Using garlands, foods, flowers, fragrance, and lamps.</p>
<p>“Next, they should worship the vajra holder and his retinue,</p>
<p>And then make offerings to the mantra deities.</p>
<p>“After singing the praises of the praiseworthy buddhas,</p>
<p>They should reflect on bodhicitta</p>
<p>And cultivate compassion, in any suitable way,</p>
<p>For beings tormented by birth, old age, sickness, and death.</p>
<p>“They should then sequentially read The Sūtra of the Great Assembly,</p>
<p>The Auspicious Verses,The Supreme Wheel of Dharma,</p>
<p>The Secret of the Thus-Gone Ones,The Great Lamp,</p>
<p>Or other texts deemed suitable.</p>
<p>“Once the directions are secure, including zenith and nadir,</p>
<p>And once the armor has been donned,</p>
<p>They should use colored pigments to draw</p>
<p>One of the maṇḍalas mentioned before.</p>
<p>“In it they should draw concentric circles,</p>
<p>Of vajras, fire, water, wind, and spears.</p>
<p>Drawing the outer enclosure will vex the minds</p>
<p>Of devas, asuras, and any hostile beings.</p>
<p>“The mantrins should take a seat, consecrated as a lion throne,</p>
<p>And place it at the center of the maṇḍala.</p>
<p>After performing the rites of self-protection, they should sit,</p>
<p>Pick up the ritual substance, swiftly complete the recitation,</p>
<p>And perform a thousand incense homas.</p>
<p>“Next, they wash the substance with scented water,</p>
<p>Dispel the many types of vighnas,</p>
<p>Place it on top of three bodhi leaves,</p>
<p>And cover it with four more.</p>
<p>“They recite the mantra for as long as necessary,</p>
<p>Until they see the three signs:</p>
<p>The substance will grow warm, smoke, or blaze with fire.</p>
<p>Even if the order is reversed, accomplishment is said to be reached.</p>
<p>“Warmth indicates control over any being,</p>
<p>Smoke indicates the power of invisibility,</p>
<p>And fire indicates the ability to fly through the sky</p>
<p>In a human body that shines like a god.</p>
<p>“Just as a chill enters the body,</p>
<p>Just as a gandharva enters a womb,</p>
<p>Just as fire springs from the sunlight stored in a sunstone,</p>
<p>So the siddhis enter the body.</p>
<p>“Should a lamp’s flame grow and blaze intensely,</p>
<p>Appearing as a bright, golden tendril</p>
<p>That continues to burn even after the oil is spent,</p>
<p>Then the mantrin has obtained the siddhi.</p>
<p>These are the siddhis born from the ritual substance.</p>
<p>“A person has reached attainment</p>
<p>If the painted image shakes;</p>
<p>If a garland, eyebrow, eye, fly whisk,</p>
<p>Or ornaments begin to move;</p>
<p>If flowers rain down or a squall strikes;</p>
<p>If the earth shakes rapidly;</p>
<p>If a disembodied voice calls from the sky,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Sole child, request the sublime boon you desire’;</p>
<p>If divine drums sound, causing their hair to bristle;</p>
<p>If a great rain of ornaments falls;</p>
<p>Or if they see with their own eyes</p>
<p>A deva, asura, or an image of the mantra in the sky.</p>
<p>“They should mix fresh flowers, refined gold, and water,</p>
<p>And arrange offering water while uttering praises.</p>
<p>They should then bow their heads with a focused mind</p>
<p>And request the boon aligned with their faith and effort.</p>
<p>“The boon received, they should bow with joy,</p>
<p>Sing praises and present offering water with faith,</p>
<p>Speak the mantra, and request the deity to depart.</p>
<p>This is the procedure for all mantras.</p>
<p>“A mantrin of outstanding mental strength</p>
<p>Should now perform a fearsome rite.</p>
<p>A piśāca would take the chance</p>
<p>To ruin a person with feeble mental strength.</p>
<p>“An armor-clad hero skilled with weapons,</p>
<p>Riding atop a fine, equipped elephant,</p>
<p>Can conquer an entire host of enemies</p>
<p>By hoisting a bow and letting one mighty arrow fly.</p>
<p>“Likewise, a person of great mental strength,</p>
<p>Armored in discipline and astride the elephant of protection,</p>
<p>Hoists the bow of mantra and lets fly the arrow of recitation,</p>
<p>To conquer creatures of the night like bhūtas and the rest.</p>
<p>“A person with a bent back, extra or missing limbs,</p>
<p>One who too short, too tall, or obese,</p>
<p>One born from a loathsome womb, or a paṇḍaka—</p>
<p>Corpses of these types should be rejected.</p>
<p>“When a corpse is found of someone who died</p>
<p>Of indigestion, intense fever, diarrhea vomiting,</p>
<p>Confinement, water, or impaling;</p>
<p>Who was killed by a snake; died of poisoning,</p>
<p>Bile, wind, and so forth; or another observable cause;</p>
<p>Or else one with its limbs intact, an uninjured face,</p>
<p>Or one free of open wounds,</p>
<p>Take a sword or club in hand</p>
<p>And keep guard over it throughout the day.</p>
<p>“In a charnel ground, an empty house, at a lone tree,</p>
<p>Crossroads, near a river or stream,</p>
<p>At a lake, ocean, or on a mountain,</p>
<p>Raising a corpse will instantly succeed.</p>
<p>“Once a suitable location is determined,</p>
<p>It should be smeared with a mixture of earth, cow dung, and so forth.</p>
<p>In that clean place draw the samaya</p>
<p>Using white, red, black, and other various pigments.</p>
<p>“Reflecting on the maṇḍalas already described,</p>
<p>Select the one that best suits the intended aim,</p>
<p>And draw the sublime mother of the clan,</p>
<p>After assiduously reciting with great faith.</p>
<p>“A fearless assistant should retrieve the corpse,</p>
<p>Carry it over, and place it on some kuśa grass.</p>
<p>Its head and body should be shaved of hair,</p>
<p>And immediately anointed with grain oil.</p>
<p>“Take four vases whose bases are not black,</p>
<p>Fill them with clean water, and use them to scrub the corpse.</p>
<p>Dress it in a set of white clothes,</p>
<p>And place it on kuśa grass at the maṇḍala’s center.</p>
<p>“Place a fresh flower on the corpse,</p>
<p>And orient its head either to the east or south.</p>
<p>Anoint it with fragrance, cense it with incense,</p>
<p>Drape it with a garland, and scatter flower petals on it.</p>
<p>“To the extent possible, procure a number of cakes</p>
<p>Made of mixed meat, fish, ghee, sesame, and the like.</p>
<p>Give them to the bhūtas, nāgas, piśācas, yakṣas,</p>
<p>And other spirits above, below, and throughout the directions.</p>
<p>“One should protect oneself and one’s excellent assistant,</p>
<p>And with a focused mind recite the mantra.</p>
<p>As the moment of the corpse’s animation nears,</p>
<p>All manner of frightful vighnas will appear.</p>
<p>“Incant ash, whole mustard seeds, and the like</p>
<p>With an uṣṇīṣarāja mantra and scatter them about.</p>
<p>When vighnas approach from the four directions,</p>
<p>Drive them off with the power of mantra.</p>
<p>“To pacify them wrathfully,</p>
<p>Use the forceful rites of Amṛtakuṇḍalin.</p>
<p>Once the vighnas have been defeated,</p>
<p>The corpse will swiftly rise through the power of mantra.</p>
<p>“Anything found among the ritual procedures of mantra</p>
<p>Can be accomplished without any limitation.</p>
<p>But if the corpse has risen</p>
<p>And its mantra rite is not known,</p>
<p>One can still receive the siddhi</p>
<p>Using rites taught elsewhere upon the risen corpse.</p>
<p>“The corpse will grant the siddhis</p>
<p>Of locating treasure, entering openings in the earth,</p>
<p>A sword, eye ointment, a mount, a servant,</p>
<p>mines, metallurgy, alchemy, and flight.</p>
<p>“A weak-minded person who seeks siddhis from corpses</p>
<p>While lacking the power of protection and mantra,</p>
<p>And the power of observances and the mind,</p>
<p>Will be killed by the creatures of the night.”</p>
<p>This was the sixth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>“Those hoping to sell human flesh</p>
<p>Should visit a charnel ground during the waning moon,</p>
<p>And at night, feeling no fear,</p>
<p>Take the calf, thigh, neck, or head</p>
<p>From someone killed by a wood or stone weapon,</p>
<p>Poison, beating, medicine, or a vighna.</p>
<p>“It should be chopped into pieces</p>
<p>And generously placed in clean new bowls or pots.</p>
<p>They should mark their body with a bloody handprint</p>
<p>And wrap their head and neck with intestines.</p>
<p>“Clothed in fresh human skin,</p>
<p>They should hold a pot of flesh in their left hand</p>
<p>And grip a bloody sword in their right,</p>
<p>Brandishing it aloft.</p>
<p>“They should call out in a loud voice,</p>
<p>‘Who among you wants to buy this flesh?’</p>
<p>Repeating the words while quickly circling</p>
<p>To the east, west, north, and south.</p>
<p>“A figure visible or invisible will ask,</p>
<p>‘What is it you seek? Wealth? Knowledge?</p>
<p>To be an alchemist? A village? A kingdom?</p>
<p>Or perhaps to enter openings in the earth?’</p>
<p>They should only respond with their original purpose in mind,</p>
<p>But otherwise say nothing else.</p>
<p>“ ‘To this charnel ground, a haunt of many vidyās,</p>
<p>I came with this purpose, impelled by intense suffering.</p>
<p>So if you have flesh, bring it and give it to me.</p>
<p>If the amount of flesh does not suffice when weighed upon a scale,</p>
<p>You make up the difference using your own flesh.</p>
<p>If this charnel ground is empty,</p>
<p>Go elsewhere, penniless child.’</p>
<p>“If a creature of the night makes such a demand,</p>
<p>Ask it, ‘Where should I go?’</p>
<p>The mantrin should consider their response carefully,</p>
<p>Leave the flesh behind, and depart.</p>
<p>“The rites of flesh that I have taught</p>
<p>Should not be used without mantra recitation.</p>
<p>I have taught about protection in charnel grounds,</p>
<p>In the Vidyottama,Uṣṇīṣa,Mahābāla, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Use a wrathful mantra for flesh-eaters</p>
<p>When performing a homa of human flesh in a charnel ground.</p>
<p>Chop the flesh into two- or three-finger-width pieces with a knife,</p>
<p>And offer it into the fire a thousand times.</p>
<p>“The charnel ground should be arrayed</p>
<p>With fresh flowers, parched grain, meat, blood, fish,</p>
<p>Honey, sweet liquor, sesame, incense, garlands,</p>
<p>Unguents, lamps, porridge, food, and oblations.</p>
<p>“To possess, banish, or put someone to sleep,</p>
<p>Crush an army, or lay waste to a town,</p>
<p>One should offer a homa of flesh</p>
<p>To fierce flesh-eating mātṛkās, the host of rākṣasīs, and to yakṣas.</p>
<p>“If human flesh cannot be found,</p>
<p>A homa using cow flesh is also recommended.</p>
<p>The flesh of a buffalo or dog mixed with ghee</p>
<p>Can be used in a homa on specific dates after fasting.</p>
<p>“The ritual procedure involving a yakṣiṇī</p>
<p>Will grant its achievement once she is satisfied with mantra.</p>
<p>She will act as one’s mother, mother-in-law, aunt,</p>
<p>Companion, daughter, wife, or new bride.</p>
<p>“A mother, mother-in-law, and aunt</p>
<p>Are the highest attainments, like wish-fulfilling jewels.</p>
<p>A pleasing companion or daughter are middling,</p>
<p>And a wife or new bride are considered lesser attainments.</p>
<p>“One should make offerings three times a day</p>
<p>Of flowers, garlands, fragrances,</p>
<p>Lamps of ghee or oil, and fragrant incense of sandal or agarwood.</p>
<p>A variety of oblations should be offered at night.</p>
<p>The yakṣiṇī will then gladly approach,</p>
<p>Granting what is sought and drawing forth seed.</p>
<p>“Women consumed with desire</p>
<p>Are certainly a cause of harm.</p>
<p>One should not flee when women cause harm,</p>
<p>Nor hope for any gain, be it great or small.</p>
<p>“Once a mantrin has blocked his semen at night,</p>
<p>He should arouse his diligence and take up the practice.</p>
<p>If those who are ignorant were to exert themselves otherwise,</p>
<p>They would be swiftly annihilated by the yakṣiṇī.</p>
<p>Even the very thought of it is ruinous.</p>
<p>“This is what is done for the flesh-eating yakṣiṇī herself;</p>
<p>There are additional rites to perform apart from this:</p>
<p>“Flesh, alcohol, radishes, vegetables, balls of rice,</p>
<p>Fish, and preparations of barley, beans, and rice—</p>
<p>These oblations should all be censed with incense and offered.</p>
<p>“An empty house or charnel ground is an auspicious site.</p>
<p>Offerings of flowers should be made, including those of śirīsa,</p>
<p>Kunduru, arka, bilva, bṛhatī, kuśa, rājārka, akas,</p>
<p>Utpala, turuṣka, pomegranate, aśoka, and so forth.</p>
<p>“To nāgas offer a fragrant incense made of molasses, milk, and ghee.</p>
<p>Offer them fragrant sandalwood and agarwood,</p>
<p>Garlands and various fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>Porridge, yogurt, parched grain, and fruit.</p>
<p>“To uragas offer, to the extent they can be found,</p>
<p>Blue banners, blue vases, and blue clothes,</p>
<p>As well as blue food, oblations, fragrances,</p>
<p>Garlands, flowers, and unguents.</p>
<p>“An oracle always appears</p>
<p>In a thumbnail, mirror, sword, water, crystal,</p>
<p>In a lamp, the ground, iron, the sky,</p>
<p>A jeweled bowl, or a blazing fire.</p>
<p>“The oracle knows the past, present, and future,</p>
<p>And all the virtuous and nonvirtuous deeds</p>
<p>In the heavens, on earth, and beyond time,</p>
<p>As well as those of the devas and asuras.</p>
<p>“If the rite deteriorates or is half-recited,</p>
<p>If syllables are added or syllables are omitted,</p>
<p>If recitation is not performed or faith is lacking,</p>
<p>If there is no worship or the site is unclean,</p>
<p>“If the sun’s rays are blocked by clouds,</p>
<p>If the child has deformed limbs, or too many,</p>
<p>Then the oracle will not enter the person,</p>
<p>And what is sought will not be revealed.</p>
<p>“So that the oracle descends, recite according to the prescribed rite:</p>
<p>On an auspicious date the mantrin should complete a fast,</p>
<p>And in the evening smear the ground with soil and cow dung</p>
<p>To create an area the size of a cow’s hide.</p>
<p>“They should offer scented unguents,</p>
<p>Flowers, incense, and lamps.</p>
<p>Ritually prepare the young child.</p>
<p>“Then, in the morning, perform the rite in full:</p>
<p>After bathing, the mantrin should dress in clean white clothes,</p>
<p>Sit facing east upon a seat of kuśa grass,</p>
<p>And then bring the mantra to mind.</p>
<p>“The mirror should be wiped with clean ash,</p>
<p>Seven, eight, or even ten times.</p>
<p>While the mantra is recited one-pointedly,</p>
<p>The young child, facing west,</p>
<p>Looks with a divine eye</p>
<p>And sees past, present, and future.</p>
<p>“For all rites designated mirror rites,</p>
<p>The oracle should use a sword.</p>
<p>Lac should be applied to the thumbnail,</p>
<p>Which is then smeared with fragrant oils.</p>
<p>“The mantrin sets out a stable, clean vase filled with water,</p>
<p>And fills a jeweled bowl sitting on the ground with water.</p>
<p>After offering fragrant unguents and flowers to the image,</p>
<p>The young child should look into it.</p>
<p>“Through the oracle or in dreams and so forth,</p>
<p>One should look for signs of the siddhis and then recite.</p>
<p>If the mantrin is not confident,</p>
<p>Recite a vidyā mantra that is not malevolent.</p>
<p>“Once a poṣadha fast has been observed,</p>
<p>The mantrin concentrates intently on one of my pure mantras,</p>
<p>And recites it before a caitya containing relics of the Victor,</p>
<p>Or in the presence of an undamaged image.</p>
<p>“Restraining the movement of body, speech, and mind,</p>
<p>As well as the hands, eyes, brow, and limbs,</p>
<p>They turn their mind toward the mantra</p>
<p>And sit on a mat of kuśa grass while cultivating love.</p>
<p>“Maintaining focus for as long as possible,</p>
<p>They should recite 100,000 or 200,000 times.</p>
<p>My mantra hūṁ can even enter wood,</p>
<p>So no need mention that it can enter a person.</p>
<p>“Next, the vessel of possession should be examined.</p>
<p>It can be a girl aged ten or twelve,</p>
<p>Or ten, eight, seven, four, or three.</p>
<p>A boy is also suitable, one who is two or five years of age.</p>
<p>“They should be attractive, their joints, bones, and veins not visible.</p>
<p>They should have all their limbs, and long, white eyes.</p>
<p>Their face should be like the moon, their incisors even and sharp,</p>
<p>Their fingers elegant and compact, and their ankle bones sunken.</p>
<p>“They should have a deep, beautiful navel and well-proportioned chest,</p>
<p>Each strand of their hair should be thick and black,</p>
<p>Their stomach should not sag, but have the three folds,</p>
<p>And they should have a good complexion and striking appearance.</p>
<p>“They should be consistently pleasing to look at,</p>
<p>Such that one never tires of seeing them,</p>
<p>And they should be a vessel for possession</p>
<p>That is indifferent to other deities.</p>
<p>“On an auspicious date, the mantrin should fast all day,</p>
<p>And make offerings of incense, garlands, sandalwood, flowers, and lamps.</p>
<p>They should present many oblations of food, porridge, and the like</p>
<p>To all the devas, asuras, and yakṣas.</p>
<p>“The vessels to be possessed should be bathed and dressed in white.</p>
<p>Facing east, all their ornaments should be removed.</p>
<p>They should be given fragrant unguents, flowers, and the like,</p>
<p>And be censed with incense—then the recitation should commence.</p>
<p>“After first reciting the mantra hūṁ,</p>
<p>Say the words ‘gṛhṇa āveśaya.’</p>
<p>If the child opens their eyes and does not smile,</p>
<p>Know the possession to be complete</p>
<p>And ask any questions without fear.</p>
<p>“Present offering water and incense,</p>
<p>Call to mind the mantra of the supreme vidyā,</p>
<p>Then bow to them and ask,</p>
<p>‘What class of deity are you?’</p>
<p>Issue the directive,</p>
<p>‘Consider well my aims in the three times,</p>
<p>Tell me if I will be happy or suffer,</p>
<p>And if I will obtain siddhis or not.’</p>
<p>Once these are properly ascertained,</p>
<p>Release the oracle right away.</p>
<p>“A malevolent person will use these mantra rites</p>
<p>To cause a human to enter the vessel of possession.</p>
<p>One thus led astray by the deluded</p>
<p>Will become an object of everyone’s ridicule.</p>
<p>“When a deity enters the vessel of possession,</p>
<p>They will be serene, lucid, broad, and tall,</p>
<p>Appear resolute, radiant, bright, and flush,</p>
<p>And will smile, be constant, and have eyes like a deity.</p>
<p>“If their eyes are deep red and round,</p>
<p>Wide open, ugly, and terrifying,</p>
<p>Or if they do not smile and look about fearlessly,</p>
<p>These are the eyes of one possessed by a rākṣasa, mahoraga, or yakṣa.</p>
<p>“If the vessel of possession is not released,</p>
<p>One should intently recite The Auspicious Verses,</p>
<p>The Mahābala, The Laughter, or The Hook.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one should read the Mahāsannipāta.</p>
<p>“One should burn one hundred sticks of firewood</p>
<p>Of arka or palaśa smeared with ghee and stacked like a lion throne.</p>
<p>One should then wrathfully perform twenty-one homas</p>
<p>Using unbroken sesame mixed with honey and ghee.</p>
<p>“By carrying out the mantra rites as prescribed,</p>
<p>And by keeping their samaya perfectly,</p>
<p>Mantrins will attain siddhis aligned with my intent,</p>
<p>And will long be free from the afflictions.”</p>
<p>This was the seventh chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>“The Buddha taught the eightfold path:</p>
<p>Right livelihood, right action, right samādhi, right speech,</p>
<p>Right effort, right intention, right attention, and right view.</p>
<p>A mantrin should correctly rely on each and every one.</p>
<p>“Through this path one finds success in mantras,</p>
<p>And likewise the higher realms and liberation.</p>
<p>The victors of the past and the victors’ heirs</p>
<p>Have gone along it to become thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>“Those who, with an insatiable mind,</p>
<p>Reverentially gather merit with body, speech, and mind</p>
<p>Will cultivate that path of virtue</p>
<p>If they embrace the true path spoken by the Sugata.</p>
<p>“Relinquishing all grasping,</p>
<p>Content with simple robes,</p>
<p>Meager alms and medicines, and plain bedding,</p>
<p>They will receive merit.</p>
<p>“They should never praise themselves,</p>
<p>Nor should they disparage other beings.</p>
<p>Regarding the world as a tiger, snake, or fire,</p>
<p>They should forsake it and take joy in solitude.</p>
<p>“They give up scrutinizing the features of men and women,</p>
<p>Medicine, and elephants, and investigating the stars.</p>
<p>They give up examining weapons, scrutinizing horses,</p>
<p>And the study of base literature and treatises.</p>
<p>“They should neither observe nor instigate fights</p>
<p>Between elephants, horses, cattle, cocks, dogs,</p>
<p>Grouse, partridges, owls, men, women,</p>
<p>Boys, girls, children, sheep, and so forth.</p>
<p>“They should not gossip about the realm or serve kings,</p>
<p>Nor trade stories of war, wrestlers, or young women,</p>
<p>Nor tell fantastical tales or weave histories,</p>
<p>And should not speak of their desires or discuss sex work.</p>
<p>“Mantrins intent on mantra recitation should not frequent</p>
<p>Towns, cities, homes, or monasteries,</p>
<p>Caityas, mountain hermitages, the haunts of ascetics,</p>
<p>Pleasure gardens, ponds, or pools.</p>
<p>“If unable to find the places previously described,</p>
<p>They should reside and recite in empty shrines,</p>
<p>At a tree, mountain, river, stream, or waterfall,</p>
<p>In an empty forest, empty land, or any suitable place.</p>
<p>“If they cannot settle on a place,</p>
<p>They can stay in any suitable place</p>
<p>For a span of eight months.</p>
<p>In the months of winter and spring</p>
<p>Mantrins can make their home</p>
<p>At an isolated lake, tree, mountain,</p>
<p>Pond, house, or riverbank,</p>
<p>And remain there alone through the summer.</p>
<p>“Just as the Victor taught monks the custom</p>
<p>Of not traveling during the three summer months,</p>
<p>So the Blessed One said that mantrins</p>
<p>Should stay in one place for three months.</p>
<p>“In the summer mantrins should not seek accomplishment,</p>
<p>But rather spend their time only on recitation.</p>
<p>When the summer has passed, they should harness the might of mantra,</p>
<p>Perform the self-protection rites, and take up their practice.</p>
<p>“They should make well-formed fire pits:</p>
<p>One round, one triangular, one square, and one like a lotus.</p>
<p>They should be smooth and even,</p>
<p>And well-daubed with soil and cow dung.</p>
<p>“A round pit is best suited for pacification rites,</p>
<p>And those for generating power, attracting wealth, and invitation.</p>
<p>A triangular pit is used for fierce activities:</p>
<p>Those for isolating, banishing, killing, and other hostile acts.</p>
<p>“A square pit is for sapping the life force</p>
<p>Or crushing the limbs of nāgas and guhyakas.</p>
<p>A lotus pit is suited to accomplish any aim,</p>
<p>And for acquiring women, girls, a village, or a kingdom.</p>
<p>“The fire pits should be smeared with pure cow dung,</p>
<p>Then kuśa grass spread around them as the final step.</p>
<p>“The mantrin should follow the ritual to make offerings</p>
<p>Of all available garlands, incense, fragrances, and fresh flowers,</p>
<p>Offering them faithfully to the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>Vajrapāṇi, and the main female deity.</p>
<p>“They should place abundant firewood near the fire pit,</p>
<p>Stoke the fire using a fan, and bow to the buddhas.</p>
<p>For wrathful rites they should use Amṛtakuṇḍalin,</p>
<p>Making oblations by casting into the fire</p>
<p>Seven, eight, ten, or twenty fresh lotuses or whole black mustard seeds.</p>
<p>“The mantrin should sit facing east</p>
<p>On a bed or bolster of kuśa grass, or a grass mat.</p>
<p>After smearing the ritual substance with ghee, honey, and milk,</p>
<p>They should perform a homa to perfect their mantra.</p>
<p>“The fire will reveal certain signs:</p>
<p>Sparks, smoke, a tongue of flame, and sound.</p>
<p>With these the fire, empowered by mantra,</p>
<p>Will show what has been accomplished and what has not.</p>
<p>“If the fire is smokeless, shines with a golden color,</p>
<p>Has tremendous flames that swirl to the right,</p>
<p>Is colored like a rainbow, is white,</p>
<p>Or has the color of crushed coral;</p>
<p>If it is very oily, or has flames radiating from its base;</p>
<p>If it shines brightly like the rays of the sun,</p>
<p>Takes the shape of a vase, banner, or parasol,</p>
<p>Or resembles the śrīvatsa mark, lotus, or ritual ladle;</p>
<p>If its flames appear like a trident, vajra, or sword,</p>
<p>Fine chariot or fly whisk;</p>
<p>If it sounds like a clay drum, large drum, or flute;</p>
<p>If its smoke and flames are fragrant and give off good sparks;</p>
<p>Or if the fire burns without being lit,</p>
<p>At that moment extensive siddhis are achieved.</p>
<p>“If there is a lot of smoke and wild sparks;</p>
<p>If the fire burns with difficulty or burns very low;</p>
<p>Or if its flames die out, are without luster, or rough,</p>
<p>If they are the color of a dark cloud or of palāśa,</p>
<p>If they resemble a spike, appear to be very fine,</p>
<p>Or resemble the coarse hairs on the head of an animal,</p>
<p>If the flames spread and burn the one performing homa,</p>
<p>Or if they smell like a corpse, it is a sign that there are no siddhis.</p>
<p>“Upon seeing flames with features like these,</p>
<p>Perform a homa of Mahābala using ghee.</p>
<p>“A mantrin should not pluck the hairs</p>
<p>Of their calves or armpits by hand,</p>
<p>Singe them with fire, shave them with a razor,</p>
<p>Or apply medicines to make themselves hairless.</p>
<p>“Just as a person holding a sword by the blade</p>
<p>Will cut their hand if not holding it carefully,</p>
<p>If a mantra is not recited with care,</p>
<p>There will either be no result, or one will fall to ruin.</p>
<p>“It is not the mantra deity that will harm</p>
<p>A person lacking discipline or ritual purity,</p>
<p>It is those among the deity’s retinue,</p>
<p>Who seize the chance to bring ruin upon them.</p>
<p>“The first step in pursuit of any accomplishment</p>
<p>Is to always make abundant offerings of food oblations.</p>
<p>Even after the mantra activity is complete,</p>
<p>One should always offer everything they are moved to offer.</p>
<p>“The mantrin should say:</p>
<p>‘Devas, asuras, yakṣas, uragas, and kumbhāṇḍas,</p>
<p>Garuḍas, suparṇas, and kaṭapūtanas,</p>
<p>Gandharvas, rākṣasas, and various classes of grahas,</p>
<p>All magical beings who live upon the earth,</p>
<p>Along with your families and households,</p>
<p>I kneel with folded hands and supplicate you—</p>
<p>Please come here from your homes and bring benefit.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhūtas who dwell atop Mount Meru,</p>
<p>In pleasure groves and the divine realms,</p>
<p>Mountains of the east and west,</p>
<p>The houses of the sun and moon, and upon any mountain;</p>
<p>“Who live in rivers or at their confluence,</p>
<p>Dwell in jeweled abodes,</p>
<p>In lakes, ponds, pools, at the water’s edge,</p>
<p>Or in the many small rivulets;</p>
<p>“ ‘Who live in towns, cattle pens, and deserted cities,</p>
<p>Vacant houses and shrines to the gods,</p>
<p>Monasteries and caityas,</p>
<p>The haunts of ascetics, and in elephant stalls;</p>
<p>“ ‘Who live in the treasuries of kings,</p>
<p>In narrow lanes, assembly halls, and at crossroads,</p>
<p>Along the great highways, under lone trees,</p>
<p>In the great charnel grounds, and in vast forests;</p>
<p>“ ‘And who live among lions, bears, and beasts of prey,</p>
<p>In the great and fearsome wilds,</p>
<p>On the sublime continents, Mount Sumeru,</p>
<p>Or within a charnel ground—</p>
<p>“ ‘Delight, be glad, and accept these respectful offerings</p>
<p>Of garlands, flowers, scents, incense, praise, oblations, and lamps.</p>
<p>Drink them and keep them,</p>
<p>And let these activities bear their fruit.’</p>
<p>“Once such offerings have been made to the grahas,</p>
<p>The mantrin should make offerings to the directional guardians:</p>
<p>‘Iśāṇa and your host of bhūtas,</p>
<p>Please accept the oblations I offer!</p>
<p>“ ‘Agni, Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa,</p>
<p>Vāyu, Kubera and your bhūtas and grahas,</p>
<p>Sūrya and Candra above, great Brahmā,</p>
<p>All devas and the nāgas on earth,</p>
<p>Mountain devas, and hosts of yakṣas,</p>
<p>Delightfully accept these oblations,</p>
<p>Offered to each of you in turn.</p>
<p>Happily remain each in your directions,</p>
<p>And join your families, kith and kin,</p>
<p>Households, and soldiers in your army</p>
<p>In partaking of these offerings</p>
<p>Of flowers, fragrance, oblations, and unguents.</p>
<p>Be grateful, and let my activities bear fruit!’</p>
<p>“Those who perform this ritual act</p>
<p>Of giving oblations to the creatures of the night</p>
<p>Will swiftly attain siddhi, be free of obstacles,</p>
<p>And receive all that they desire.”</p>
<p>This was the eighth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>“Slaying an arhat or one’s parents,</p>
<p>Creating discord in a harmonious saṅgha,</p>
<p>Or, with malicious intent,</p>
<p>Drawing blood from a tathāgata—</p>
<p>“These heinous acts the Victor called</p>
<p>The five deeds with immediate consequences.</p>
<p>Deluded people who commit just one of them</p>
<p>Will not reach attainment in their present aggregates.</p>
<p>“Destroying a caitya, slaying a bodhisattva,</p>
<p>Violating a woman who has exhausted her afflictions,</p>
<p>Killing a novice student, or coveting and then stealing</p>
<p>Something owned by the saṅgha, however great or small—</p>
<p>“These the Tathāgata called the five secondary deeds with immediate consequences.</p>
<p>A person with corrupt discipline who commits them</p>
<p>Will experience an eon of suffering in Avīci Hell,</p>
<p>And though they strive for mantra siddhis, will not attain them.</p>
<p>“Those who commit evil in the human realm</p>
<p>By mistreating, consigning to flames,</p>
<p>Or with ill intent throwing into water</p>
<p>The volumes of the Tathagata’s words,</p>
<p>By forsaking the body of teachings,</p>
<p>By killing a monk or nun adorned</p>
<p>With the full code of training,</p>
<p>By killing a holder of lay vows, male or female,</p>
<p>Or by burning a temple with ill intent</p>
<p>Will never reach attainment, no matter their austere practice.</p>
<p>“Those who intend harm to the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>And then commit even a small amount of harm,</p>
<p>Will be cooked in the hells due to their evil nature.</p>
<p>Passing on from there, the force of their actions</p>
<p>Will lead to rebirth as a human of low caste or an animal—</p>
<p>all this I have explained to you in brief.</p>
<p>“If someone who has adopted bodhicitta,</p>
<p>in delusion worships the host of worldly gods,</p>
<p>They will find no joy in it,</p>
<p>And weaken their mantra siddhis.</p>
<p>“When, in the realm of humans,</p>
<p>Those of lucid mind adopt bodhicitta,</p>
<p>It is they, thenceforth, who are worthy of worship</p>
<p>By devas, asuras, and all the world.</p>
<p>“A person who adopts all exalted precepts in full,</p>
<p>And who grants fearlessness to all beings,</p>
<p>Is a representative of the lineage of the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>“Mantrins should not perform heinous acts, kill a sage,</p>
<p>Disrupt or cause harm to a vidyā mantra,</p>
<p>Fail to venerate the mantra assembly out of ill intent,</p>
<p>Pointlessly pick at grass with their nails,</p>
<p>Rub their legs together,</p>
<p>Pierce the noses of cattle herds and the like,</p>
<p>Fail to respect the noble saṅgha,</p>
<p>Or eat gifts to the bhūtas, oblations to the gods,</p>
<p>Or food that has a fallen on the ground.</p>
<p>They should not, when overcome with desire,</p>
<p>Approach animals or prohibited women.</p>
<p>They should not tame elephants or handle snakes,</p>
<p>Nor whip the flanks of the horse they ride.</p>
<p>Those who perform such actions</p>
<p>Will never receive the siddhis.</p>
<p>“Mantrins should always cultivate affection</p>
<p>For beings who suffer or are beset with disease.</p>
<p>“Just as the extent of the boundless sky</p>
<p>Cannot be measured in arm spans,</p>
<p>So it is impossible to gauge the extent of virtue and evil</p>
<p>Of the benefit and harm done by those supported by the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>“If they use nets, traps, or snares</p>
<p>To kill beings such as dogs and the like,</p>
<p>Or if they trap crows and other birds in cages,</p>
<p>They will not reach accomplishment in this life or the next.</p>
<p>“They should neither trample on, nor adorn their heads with,</p>
<p>The old, discarded flowers of Māra’s Foe,</p>
<p>Nor should they eat the food offered to them,</p>
<p>Even when they are beset with hunger.</p>
<p>“Not even in fear should they pay homage to</p>
<p>Brahmā, Śakra, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Vāyu, and the rest.</p>
<p>They should not follow the teachings they propound,</p>
<p>Practice their austerities, or worship their symbols.</p>
<p>They should not harbor animosity to their doctrines,</p>
<p>But should never delight in their practice either.</p>
<p>They should never praise them or recite their mantras.</p>
<p>“When giving a gift they should give with compassion.</p>
<p>They should venerate places visited by the Sugata,</p>
<p>And pay homage to the heirs of the Victor.</p>
<p>Pratyekabuddhas and the Victor’s own śrāvakas</p>
<p>Should be the object of their constant veneration.</p>
<p>“Just as people who venerate a phase of the moon</p>
<p>Do not venerate the moon in all its fullness,</p>
<p>So those who faithfully venerate the Victor’s heirs</p>
<p>Are not venerating the Sugata himself.</p>
<p>“One who holds the most exalted of all the world’s precepts</p>
<p>Is the very embodiment of compassion, taking birth for beings’ sake.</p>
<p>Why would we not venerate them all,</p>
<p>They who are as if an only child?</p>
<p>“A wicked person who does not bow before</p>
<p>An astonishing person, rich in miraculous power,</p>
<p>Will be distrusted by the victors,</p>
<p>And will not be granted their mantra siddhis.</p>
<p>“Just as a tree’s flower will at first beguile,</p>
<p>And only later transform into fruit,</p>
<p>Know sublime beings to be like flowers,</p>
<p>And the victors to be their fruit.</p>
<p>“Homage to those who uphold the awakened way,</p>
<p>Who are naturally free of attachment,</p>
<p>Yet show compassion to the kind,</p>
<p>Anger to the angry, and desire to the desirous.</p>
<p>“Homage to the guides of mantra,</p>
<p>Who with knowledge of actions and results</p>
<p>Assume the form of mantras</p>
<p>That are most suited to every being.”</p>
<p>This was the ninth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>“For the benefit of devas, asuras, and humans,</p>
<p>The Victor taught The Vidyādhara’s Basket,</p>
<p>Various types of vidyā and mantra</p>
<p>Numbering thirty million, five hundred thousand.</p>
<p>“To conquer guhyakas</p>
<p>And remove poverty’s misery,</p>
<p>I taught seventy million mantras</p>
<p>Along with their maṇḍalas and mudrās.</p>
<p>“I have described in detail all who belong to the vajra clan:</p>
<p>The ten dūtīs, the seven vidyā kings,</p>
<p>The sixty-four servants,</p>
<p>My eight supreme essences,</p>
<p>The powerful lords of vidyās,</p>
<p>Such as Amṛtakuṇḍalin and Vidyottama,</p>
<p>And all who are aligned with their mantras.</p>
<p>“Avalokiteśvara has likewise taught mantras</p>
<p>Numbering three million, five hundred thousand,</p>
<p>Including his lord of vidyās Hayagrīva,</p>
<p>And the maṇḍalas that bear his name.</p>
<p>“Seven forms of Amoghapāśa are taught—</p>
<p>One with twelve arms, one with six, an uṣṇīṣa form,</p>
<p>One with a diadem, a fulfiller of wishes, and a four-faced form.</p>
<p>The mantras shine like seven suns upon the earth.</p>
<p>These maṇḍalas and mantras of Hayagrīva</p>
<p>Grant people boons and are revered in the three worlds.</p>
<p>“Tārā, Śvetā, Pāṇḍaravāsinī,</p>
<p>Vipaśyinī, Ekajaṭā, Gaurī,</p>
<p>Yaśovatī, and Bhṛkuṭī—</p>
<p>These are the supreme vidyā queens of the lotus clan.</p>
<p>“Within the vast system of mantra, train in Mekhalā,</p>
<p>Sovereign of vidyās and master of mantras,</p>
<p>Who takes the form of these diverse maṇḍalas</p>
<p>And possesses the various types of mudrās.</p>
<p>“Her mantra grants people boons,</p>
<p>And even Pāñcika delights in her.</p>
<p>Always in accord with that lord of yakṣas,</p>
<p>Her words describe the collection of mantra.</p>
<p>“Pāñcika teaches twenty thousand;</p>
<p>His wife explains half of that.</p>
<p>The lord of wealth teaches thirty thousand,</p>
<p>While the father of Pūrṇa explains a hundred thousand.</p>
<p>“Devas, asuras, and the rest, who have faith in the Victor,</p>
<p>Have explained mantras infinite in number.</p>
<p>Some are included within my clan,</p>
<p>Some are included in the lotus clan,</p>
<p>Some are included in the jewel clan,</p>
<p>And yet others are circumstantial and variable.</p>
<p>“The one named Māṇicara is said to be of the jewel clan,</p>
<p>I am declared to be of the so-called vajra clan,</p>
<p>Avalokiteśvara is of the lotus clan,</p>
<p>And Pāñcika is in the fourth clan.</p>
<p>“All I have explained in mantra scriptures</p>
<p>Can be coordinated with these four.</p>
<p>However, some things are circumstantial,</p>
<p>And vary in dependence on the sugatas.</p>
<p>“Everything in this scripture</p>
<p>Can be used by those desiring wealth.</p>
<p>Mantrins who follow this specific path</p>
<p>Will attain the siddhis aligned with their mind.</p>
<p>“Within the three existences, the Victor is rare and supreme.</p>
<p>The Dharma then sprung from him,</p>
<p>And his Saṅgha consisted of the eight great people.</p>
<p>Within the three existences, the Three Jewels are preeminent.</p>
<p>“Because these three are the cause of merit’s increase,</p>
<p>Those seeking siddhi should begin their mantras with:</p>
<p>‘For the sake of merit and to confound vināyakas,</p>
<p>I pay homage to Vajrapāṇi most fierce.’</p>
<p>“I, lord of yakṣas, have taught this,</p>
<p>Which is to be placed at the beginning of mantras.</p>
<p>It can govern one’s own mantra,</p>
<p>Even if it is of the jewel or lotus clan.</p>
<p>“Those who are not sugatas,</p>
<p>Who follow the paths of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas,</p>
<p>Who are bereft of faith or are selfish and sanctimonious,</p>
<p>Should never wield my vajra.</p>
<p>“Any monk, nun,</p>
<p>Male or female lay devotee,</p>
<p>Or any worldly person</p>
<p>Who is hostile to the supreme vehicle,</p>
<p>Says it is the teaching of māras,</p>
<p>In ignorance asserts that I am a yakṣa,</p>
<p>Or does not bow before a bodhisattva</p>
<p>Will see their body swiftly destroyed</p>
<p>When they recite my mantras.</p>
<p>“The grahas who belong to my clan,</p>
<p>The bhūtas, yakṣas, nāgas, and piśācas too,</p>
<p>Will angrily bring them to ruin</p>
<p>When they see them reciting my mantra or bearing my vajra.</p>
<p>“Those who study the vast supreme vehicle,</p>
<p>Have faith in it, are enthusiastic in its explication,</p>
<p>Have great diligence, and are resolute in their bodhicitta</p>
<p>Will be granted the boons of my mantras.</p>
<p>“Broadly and extensively I have explained</p>
<p>The mantras belonging to the awakened ones.</p>
<p>Listen now as I briefly explain</p>
<p>Those that are of a worldly type.</p>
<p>“Rudra has taught ten million,</p>
<p>Vāsudeva thirty thousand,</p>
<p>Brahmā sixty thousand,</p>
<p>And Sūrya three hundred thousand.</p>
<p>Garuḍa has taught eighteen thousand,</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī eight thousand,</p>
<p>Agni seven hundred,</p>
<p>And Triśaṅku one thousand.</p>
<p>The king of nāgas has taught five thousand,</p>
<p>Niśācarapati twelve thousand,</p>
<p>And the four lords of the world</p>
<p>Taught four thousand to benefit beings.</p>
<p>“Daityendra has taught two hundred thousand,</p>
<p>And Devendra three hundred thousand.</p>
<p>The mantras have various mudrās and rites,</p>
<p>And each has maṇḍalas from their respective treatise.</p>
<p>“Those with faith in their own mantra scriptures</p>
<p>Will doubtlessly succeed as if without effort.</p>
<p>When the opposite is true, siddhis are not obtained;</p>
<p>They will endure much suffering instead.”</p>
<p>This was the tenth chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>Chapter 11</p>
<p>“There are eight famed instructions:</p>
<p>Alchemy, locating treasure, entering openings in the earth,</p>
<p>Metallurgy, locating mines, mantra,</p>
<p>Mineral refinement, and the granting of immeasurable wealth.</p>
<p>“Mantra, entering openings in the earth, and alchemy—</p>
<p>These are supreme because they lead to the abandonment of evil.</p>
<p>The granting of wealth, locating treasure, and locating mines are middling.</p>
<p>Mineral refinement and metallurgy are the lesser among them.</p>
<p>“People of strong mind, with zeal for the Dharma</p>
<p>And rich in austerities, are vessels for the first of these.</p>
<p>The middling are for those in whom passion predominates,</p>
<p>While the inferior are for those beset with dullness.</p>
<p>“Those who aspire to foster the supreme</p>
<p>Should first abandon those taught as inferior.</p>
<p>Those wracked by a painful craving for wealth</p>
<p>Should make use of the middling set.</p>
<p>“Through the force of their austerities they will achieve</p>
<p>Divine happiness, riches, longevity,</p>
<p>Strength, a perfect form, erudition,</p>
<p>Radiant complexion, singular intelligence, and great influence.</p>
<p>“People who are free of attachment, delight in virtue,</p>
<p>Who are naturally inclined toward the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>And who forsake evil and engage in recitation</p>
<p>Are never far from divine attainments.</p>
<p>“Powerful as an adamantine weapon, fire, or meteor,</p>
<p>Mantras grant boons to the human realm.</p>
<p>They are unrivaled, both in this world and the next,</p>
<p>For dispelling suffering and destroying evil.</p>
<p>“For some they are like a wish-fulfilling tree,</p>
<p>For some they grant siddhis, for some they bring merit,</p>
<p>And for others physical strength and happiness—</p>
<p>Mantras grant people the results their minds desire.</p>
<p>“A mantra, emanating a diversity of forms,</p>
<p>Protects the entire mass of beings</p>
<p>Who suffer, live in fear,</p>
<p>Or are terrified of kings, thieves, and lightning.</p>
<p>“Whatever their land and wherever their home,</p>
<p>Those who recite mantra a little every day,</p>
<p>With uncorrupted austerities and focused minds,</p>
<p>Will eventually succeed in their mantras.</p>
<p>“First completing one hundred thousand recitations specified by the rite,</p>
<p>Mantrins should next begin the main practice.</p>
<p>They will then swiftly obtain the siddhis,</p>
<p>And through the rite long be free from affliction.</p>
<p>“They should smear their bodies with earth,</p>
<p>Step into water that is free of dirt,</p>
<p>And bathe themselves for as long as they wish.</p>
<p>They should emerge facing the east or north,</p>
<p>Wash their hands and feet with water,</p>
<p>Squat with their legs open and hands between them,</p>
<p>And cup water noiselessly, without making bubbles.</p>
<p>“They should take three sips of water,</p>
<p>Use the water to wipe their lips twice,</p>
<p>Close their teeth, and touch them with their tongue.</p>
<p>If they cough, they need to rinse their mouth again.</p>
<p>“Renunciants, men, women, boys, girls,</p>
<p>The elderly, and brahmins—</p>
<p>These a mantrin should never touch,</p>
<p>Nor should a mantrin think about them.</p>
<p>“Should a practitioner touch them,</p>
<p>Or be touched by them,</p>
<p>The practitioner should bathe again,</p>
<p>Rinse their mouth ritually, and resume the recitation.</p>
<p>“The mantra will enter the body</p>
<p>Of those who delight in ritual purity and recitation,</p>
<p>Have compassion, have counteracted their greed,</p>
<p>Eat alms food, and are diligent in solemn activity.</p>
<p>“Should someone offer them any amount</p>
<p>Of women, clothing, wealth, conveyances,</p>
<p>Adornments, unguents, food, drink, or bedding,</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in practice should refuse them.</p>
<p>“They should clean their anus five times with a heap of earth,</p>
<p>Their genitals three times, their left hand three times, and both hands seven.</p>
<p>Or, they can use soil and water for as long as it takes,</p>
<p>To make themselves free of filth and odor.</p>
<p>“Just as the flames of a summertime forest fire</p>
<p>Burn through a whole wilderness with ease,</p>
<p>So does the fire of recitation, stoked by the wind of discipline,</p>
<p>Send out flames of intense diligence to burn away evil.</p>
<p>“Just as snow, unable to withstand the glare,</p>
<p>Melts when struck by rays of sunlight,</p>
<p>So the snow of evil dissolves when struck</p>
<p>By the sunlight of discipline and recitation.</p>
<p>“Just as a lamp lit in deep darkness</p>
<p>Dispels every hint of gloom,</p>
<p>So the lamp of recitation quickly clears</p>
<p>The gloom of evil amassed in a thousand lifetimes.</p>
<p>“If the mantra is effected through recitation and homa,</p>
<p>But the siddhis are still not achieved,</p>
<p>A thousand caityas can be cast from clay</p>
<p>Or from sand found at a riverbank.</p>
<p>“Once this practice has extinguished the evil</p>
<p>Committed over many previous lives,</p>
<p>In this very life the mantrin will receive</p>
<p>The fruits of merit through mantra’s power.</p>
<p>“The fundamental root of mantra is discipline,</p>
<p>Followed by diligence and patience,</p>
<p>Faith in the victors, bodhicitta,</p>
<p>The mantra, and an absence of laziness.</p>
<p>“Just as a ruler possessing the seven requisites</p>
<p>Has no trouble subduing any kind of being,</p>
<p>So a mantrin possessing these seven requisites</p>
<p>Will quickly subdue any evil.</p>
<p>“After first completing most of the recitation,</p>
<p>The mantrin should then perform a homa.</p>
<p>Through homa the boons of mantra are bestowed,</p>
<p>And all one’s desires are granted.</p>
<p>“The power of mantra can summon a woman</p>
<p>From a distance of a hundred leagues away.</p>
<p>She will not be a woman but a young yakṣiṇī,</p>
<p>Who will serve the mantrin in body and deed.</p>
<p>“When performing a practice focused on desire,</p>
<p>It is the young yakṣiṇī who bestows the result.</p>
<p>Manifesting in the body of that woman,</p>
<p>She will serve the desires of the night.</p>
<p>“Just as men will exhaust their wealth</p>
<p>To serve a woman out of desire,</p>
<p>So a young yakṣiṇī or servant girl</p>
<p>Can be summoned with mantra and made to serve.</p>
<p>“Someone fixated on another person’s wife</p>
<p>Is compelled to seek her, tormented by desire.</p>
<p>Ignorantly he indulges his desire for another’s wife,</p>
<p>And receives all manner of evil.</p>
<p>“Devas, nāgas, asuras, yakṣas, gandharvas, and siddhas,</p>
<p>Who have faith in the Victor, help others, and explain mantra,</p>
<p>Are empowered by śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, tathāgatas, and bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Who have seen the beings of the future who lack a protector.</p>
<p>“Three categories of result are taught:</p>
<p>Superior, middling, and inferior.</p>
<p>Flight, entering glorious openings in the earth,</p>
<p>Shapeshifting, invisibility, marrying a young yakṣiṇī,</p>
<p>Alchemy, magical conjuration, and nocturnal activities</p>
<p>Are considered to be superior.</p>
<p>“The middling is becoming a lord of the earth,</p>
<p>While the wise have deemed inferior</p>
<p>The acquisition of cities and wealth,</p>
<p>Dividing, summoning, confining, banishing, killing,</p>
<p>Healing those stricken by hostile nāgas,</p>
<p>And all related activities.</p>
<p>“More specifically, displaying might</p>
<p>To embodied beings like nāgas, yakṣas,</p>
<p>And children possessed by grahas</p>
<p>Is considered exceedingly minor.</p>
<p>“Ritual rubbing, punching, slapping, hair pulling,</p>
<p>Reciting into the ear, transferring, banishing,</p>
<p>Killing, binding, and other acts of subjugation,</p>
<p>Invocation, using the clothing of vidyā and mantra,</p>
<p>Stomping, shaking, staring with a poisoned eye,</p>
<p>Piercing with a needle, inducing someone to vomit,</p>
<p>Blowing air, destroying limbs, summoning uragas,</p>
<p>Repeatedly restricting and suppressing, confounding,</p>
<p>Feeding poison, transferring poison elsewhere,</p>
<p>Guiding with an iron hook, expelling poison stuck in the body,</p>
<p>Feeding someone or depriving them of food,</p>
<p>Ritually securing the space, sending a messenger,</p>
<p>Dispelling, signaling a nāga,</p>
<p>And rousing with the sounds of conches and clay drums—</p>
<p>These procedures are explained in the scriptures on poison.</p>
<p>“There are eighty types of snakes on earth,</p>
<p>Roaming about causing harm to others.</p>
<p>Among them twenty are hooded,</p>
<p>Six are spotted, twelve are nonvenomous,</p>
<p>Thirteen are fierce, and thirty are crossbreeds.</p>
<p>“There are many other types of poisonous creatures,</p>
<p>Including frogs, lizards, scorpions, and spiders.</p>
<p>Poison can be transmitted by urine, feces,</p>
<p>Saliva, physical contact, sight,</p>
<p>And through the bite of fangs.</p>
<p>Those learned in scriptures on poison</p>
<p>Classify those as high, middling, and low.</p>
<p>“Creatures bite when intoxicated with poison,</p>
<p>Driven by anger, afraid,</p>
<p>Startled, hungry, provoked,</p>
<p>Impelled by Yama, or when stepped on.</p>
<p>“There are four ways of biting,</p>
<p>Which means seized by fangs or cut by teeth.</p>
<p>“Being bitten by a single fang with blood drawn</p>
<p>Is called a ‘bite’ because it results in mild poisoning.</p>
<p>“When struck by two fangs with blood drawn,</p>
<p>This is called ‘being eaten.’</p>
<p>“When three fangs break the skin,</p>
<p>This is called ‘being cut.’</p>
<p>“When the body is struck by four fangs,</p>
<p>And then eaten by the snake,</p>
<p>This is called ‘being struck and eaten.’</p>
<p>“In that case even medicine is a poor antidote.</p>
<p>The poison tears through the vital organs like fire.</p>
<p>It is the same as a weapon, fire, or piercing heat.</p>
<p>Mantra is able to pacify it</p>
<p>In ways a healer’s art cannot.</p>
<p>“Just as falling rain instantly dampens</p>
<p>An inferno steadily burning its fuel,</p>
<p>So poison, like that inferno,</p>
<p>Is pacified by the use of mantra.</p>
<p>“If a mantrin understands a poison’s potency</p>
<p>And earnestly completes the recitation from the mantra rite,</p>
<p>This approach will eliminate poisons,</p>
<p>So that like a lion among a herd of cattle</p>
<p>They can move freely, fearlessly among venomous snakes.</p>
<p>“Devas, nāgas, asuras, yakṣas, siddhas,</p>
<p>Gandharvas, bhūtas, pitṛs, guhyakas,</p>
<p>Pretas, piśācas, kaṭapūtanas,</p>
<p>Unmadas, ojohāras, chāyas,</p>
<p>And the many grahas that haunt the earth</p>
<p>Eat the fatty meat of humans</p>
<p>And drink their blood.</p>
<p>They take advantage of those made weary</p>
<p>By sorrow, strong desire, and anger,</p>
<p>Which allow them to enter their bodies.</p>
<p>“People in their grasp roam around,</p>
<p>Sing songs, dance, laugh, and grow angry.</p>
<p>They feel joy, euphoria, and become talkative,</p>
<p>Become erratic and imagine they are devas and asuras,</p>
<p>Inviting everyone’s mockery.</p>
<p>“Whether out of desire for oblations or merely for sport,</p>
<p>These beings possess bodies with an intent to kill.</p>
<p>Vajrāṅkuśa can eradicate guhyakas—</p>
<p>He a supreme vidyā, boon-granting and powerful.</p>
<p>The vidyās of my lineage are also a remedy,</p>
<p>Those such as fierce Amṛtakuṇḍalin and the rest.</p>
<p>“Grahas do not fear fire or wind,</p>
<p>The destroyer of the triple city,</p>
<p>Shining Sūrya or Pitāmaha,</p>
<p>Varuṇa or the asuras,</p>
<p>The lord of wealth or the king of yakṣas,</p>
<p>Garuḍa the king of birds,</p>
<p>Nor the rider of Airāvaṇa and destroyer of cities</p>
<p>In the same way they fear a person who wields mantra.</p>
<p>“Seeing all these vidyā mantras used for bhūtas,</p>
<p>And knowing every behavior of the grahas,</p>
<p>A mantrin will thenceforth tame them free from doubt,</p>
<p>And never again have need to fear them.</p>
<p>“Mantras are taught by he who has strengthened the three knowledges,</p>
<p>Transcended the three existences, cast off the three faults, and mastered the three paths.</p>
<p>They are also taught by his heirs and by the devas and asuras who follow his path.</p>
<p>Those who are empowered by the mantras of the eminent one, the dispeller of darkness,</p>
<p>And receive the power of the mantras praised by the host of worldly gods, will never falter.”</p>
<p>Brahmā and the gods who heard the vajra bearer speak,</p>
<p>As well as the asuras, yakṣas, siddhas,</p>
<p>Vidyādharas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas,</p>
<p>Guhyakas, pitṛs, and bhūtas,</p>
<p>Bowed their heads with faith at his feet,</p>
<p>Pressed their hands together in devotion, and said,</p>
<p>“Amazing that you have such compassion for all beings!</p>
<p>Amazing is your manifold activity!</p>
<p>“Because of this, some see you as a blazing vajra,</p>
<p>Some as bearing a club, others and holding a disc,</p>
<p>Yet others as holding a trident or lasso,</p>
<p>Or as bearing a sword, bow, or cudgel.</p>
<p>For some you take a frightening form, bristling with weapons,</p>
<p>While others see you in a state of peace.</p>
<p>“We bow to you who is venerated by devas and yakṣas,</p>
<p>Who takes many forms but whose form is imperceptible.</p>
<p>We bow in homage to you whose feet are honored by asuras and devas,</p>
<p>And to whom the supreme bodhisattvas pay homage.</p>
<p>Lord of vidyās with bowstring drawn, we bow to you.</p>
<p>We all pay homage and bow to you.</p>
<p>From this day forward we take refuge in you.</p>
<p>“People who act with integrity,</p>
<p>In alignment with all you have said,</p>
<p>Will swiftly dispel the gloom of poverty</p>
<p>And blaze as brightly as the sun.</p>
<p>Limbs that do not fail, minds that do not decline,</p>
<p>Freedom from illness, suffering, and physical degeneration—</p>
<p>These are attained by those with faith in you.”</p>
<p>After they had spoken these words together,</p>
<p>They paid homage again and again to the vajra bearer.</p>
<p>They then promptly entered their aerial palace</p>
<p>And departed through the sky just as they arrived.</p>
<p>Once the devas had departed,</p>
<p>Vajrapāṇi said to Subāhu,</p>
<p>“The devas have understood this sūtra,</p>
<p>but you must make it known in the world.”</p>
<p>After these words had been spoken,</p>
<p>Subāhu rose, bowed respectfully, and said,</p>
<p>“I will spread it far and wide in the human realm,</p>
<p>For it purifies, destroys evil, and is rich in good fortune.”</p>
<p>This was the eleventh chapter of the noble “Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
<p>This completes the noble tantra “The Subāhu’s Questions.”</p>
