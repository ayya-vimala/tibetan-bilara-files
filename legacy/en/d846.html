<p>Who brings victory in battle over the asuras and hosts of Māra.</p>
<p>Approach, children of the Victors! Knowing that we and all beings are already beyond suffering and thus not fearing that sentient beings will fail to transcend it, may we still insatiably cultivate the accumulations of merit and wisdom. May we know that things are intrinsically conditioned, yet not dismiss their characteristics. May we not reject the form body of a buddha, yet attain freedom from all attachment. May we be free from attachment to all phenomena, yet seek the wisdom that knows everything. May we completely purify all phenomena as buddha realms without depending on others, yet understand the space-like characteristic of buddha realms. May we never weary of bringing beings to maturity, yet never abandon the characteristics of lacking self-identity. May we magically display supernatural powers, yet never waver from the sphere of reality. May we not stop setting our mind on enlightenment, yet may omniscient wisdom arise in us. May we satisfy all beings by turning the wheel of the Dharma, yet not pass beyond the inexpressible nature of reality. May we  demonstrate the magical emanations and blessings of a tathāgata, without nevertheless discarding the body of a bodhisattva, and yet in all the perceptions of beings may we appear and then display the great parinirvāṇa. Children of the Victors, uphold these aspects of the teachings and practice these obverse and direct ways of engaging in practice. These ten teachings are the most excellent activity of a buddha. Children of the Victor, these are the awakened activity of a bodhisattva. The spontaneous activity of the bodhisattvas is independent of others and is the perfect attainment of unsurpassed awakening.</p>
<p>King of the gods, great sovereign, boon-granting lord,</p>
<p>Fearless hero famous throughout the world</p>
<p>Whose face is radiant with insight like the full moon—</p>
<p>The aspiration and activity of a great being is your sole companion.</p>
<p>Brahmā, Śakra, and the other world protectors</p>
<p>Used the vajra-like samādhi, Mt. Sumeru, as the churning stick</p>
<p>And, along with compassion and effort, the nāga rope,</p>
<p>Churned forth an elixir, the holy Dharma,</p>
<p>From the ocean of great insight that spread everywhere like a feast of amṛta.</p>
<p>With this jewel of merit, the renowned Dharma, as the crown jewel,</p>
<p>You were victorious in battle over the armies of rākṣasas and the asuras.</p>
<p>I dedicate this to the mighty helmet of the kingdom of the gods.</p>
<p>I dedicate this so that our radiance, retinues, and wealth may increase</p>
<p>And in particular so that we may attain powerful and strong standings.</p>
<p>I dedicate this so that we may perfect all the means of liberation</p>
<p>Such as the magical powers, supernatural cognitions, and perfections</p>
<p>And accomplish all our virtuous actions and intentions.</p>
<p>I dedicate this so that our bodies may be pervaded by the bliss of the Dharma nectar,</p>
<p>Liberating us from minds that are plagued by suffering.</p>
<p>Spiritual teachers, kind and loving friends,</p>
<p>We are wounded by the blade of the afflictions.</p>
<p>Please sustain us with your compassionate blessing</p>
<p>And ensure that whomever is granted the crown is powerful</p>
<p>And protects the teachings of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>We are faulted beings who are confused and act inappropriately—please forgive us!</p>
<p>Those who know the time, vidyāmantra, and ritual, please be patient with us.</p>
<p>We pray that the good fortune of this Dharma offering to the hosts of gods</p>
<p>Shall ensure prosperity and cause the supreme Dharma to flourish.</p>
