<h1>The Sūtra of the Sun</h1>
</header>
<p>Respectful homage to the noble Three Jewels!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park in Śrāvastī. At that time the god Sūrya was seized by Rāhu, lord of the asuras. Then the god Sūrya, recollecting and taking the Blessed One to heart, recited this verse:</p>
<p>“I bow to the heroic Buddha.</p>
<p>May you swiftly liberate all beings!</p>
<p>As I have come into confinement</p>
<p>I take refuge in you.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, for the sake of the god Sūrya, addressed Rāhu, lord of the asuras, with these verses:</p>
<p>“Since buddhas have compassion for the world,</p>
<p>Sūrya took refuge</p>
<p>In the Worthy One, the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rāhu, set the sun free!</p>
<p>“The sun, circle of mighty splendor,</p>
<p>Illuminates darkness with light.</p>
<p>Rāhu, do not conceal the sun in the sky!</p>
<p>Set this sun free, Rāhu!”</p>
<p>Thereupon Rāhu, lord of the asuras, set the god Sūrya free and hurriedly approached Vemacitra, lord of the asuras. He then sat to one side, displeased, agitated, and with all his body hairs bristling. Vemacitra, lord of the asuras, now questioned Rāhu, lord of the asuras, in verse:</p>
<p>“Why, Rāhu, did you release</p>
<p>The sun in such a fright?</p>
<p>You are a very miserable sight.</p>
<p>Why did you approach in fear?”</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>“Had I, hearing the Buddha’s verse,</p>
<p>Not then released the sun</p>
<p>My head would have split into seven pieces</p>
<p>And my life would be without happiness.”</p>
<p>This concludes “The Sūtra of the Sun.”</p>
