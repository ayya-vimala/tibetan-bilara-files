<p>The Four Factors</p>
<p>Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park, together with a great community of monks, consisting of 1,250 monks, and a great assembly of bodhisattvas. At that time, the Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon four factors even at the cost of their lives. What are these four?</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon the thought of awakening even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon the spiritual friend even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon tolerance and lenience even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon dwelling in the wilderness even at the cost of their lives.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as they live, bodhisattvas, great beings, should not abandon these four factors even at the cost of their lives.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One spoke these words, and once the Sugata had spoken in this way, he, the Teacher, also said the following:</p>
<p>“Let the wise conceive the thought of perfect awakening,</p>
<p>And not cast aside the thought of omniscience;</p>
<p>Let them maintain the strength of tolerance and lenience,</p>
<p>And never forsake the spiritual friend.</p>
<p>“If the wise, like the king of beasts, abandon fear,</p>
<p>Always remain dwelling in the wilderness,</p>
<p>And constantly maintain these factors,</p>
<p>They will conquer the māras and attain awakening.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had said this, the monks and bodhisattvas, together with the entire assembly, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra on the Four Factors.”</p>
