<h1>The Noble Dhāraṇī</h1>
</header>
<p>Praising the Qualities of the Immeasurable One</p>
<p>Homage to the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>namo ratna­trayāya namo bhagavate amitabhāya tathāgatāya arhate saṃyak­sambuddhāya |tadyathā oṃ amite amitodbhave amita­saṃbhave amita­vikrānte amita­gamini gagana­kīrti­kare sarva­kleśa­kṣayaṃ­kare svāhā |</p>
<p>The ritual instructions for this dhāraṇī are as follows: Reciting it once purifies the karmic obscurations that you have accumulated over one hundred thousand eons. If you recite it three times a day every day, all your misdeeds will be purified, and you will obtain the roots of virtue generated by one thousand buddhas. If you recite it twenty-one times it will purify the four root downfalls. If you recite it one hundred thousand times you will have a vision of Noble Maitreya. If you recite it two hundred thousand times you will have a vision of Noble Avalokiteśvara. If you recite it three hundred thousand times you will have a vision of the tathāgata Amitābha. Since the additional benefits are innumerable, this is only a brief summary.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Dhāraṇī Praising the Qualities of the Immeasurable One.”</p>
