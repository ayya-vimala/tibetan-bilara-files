<h1>The Foundation of All Tantras, the Great Sovereign Compendium</h1>
</header>
<p>Emergence from Sampuṭa</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Oṁ, homage to Vajraḍāka!</p>
<p>Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the bhagas of vajra queens, which are the essence of the body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas. There, he noticed Vajragarbha in the midst of eight hundred million lords of yogins, and smiled. As the Blessed One smiled, Vajragarbha immediately rose from his seat, draped his robe over his shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With palms joined, he spoke to the Blessed One. {1.1.1}</p>
<p>“I would like to hear, O master of gnosis, about the secret foundation of all tantras, defined as their emergence from sampuṭa.” {1.1.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Ho Vajragarbha! Well done!</p>
<p>Well done, O great compassionate one! Well done!</p>
<p>Well done, O great bodhisattva!</p>
<p>Well done! Well done, O receptacle of qualities! {1.1.3}</p>
<p>“You are asking all about that</p>
<p>Which is secret in all the tantras.” {1.1.4}</p>
<p>Thereupon, these great bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>With Vajragarbha as their leader,</p>
<p>Asked questions according to their respective doubts</p>
<p>With eyes wide open in great exhilaration. {1.1.5}</p>
<p>Bowing repeatedly, they asked,</p>
<p>“What is meant by all the tantras?</p>
<p>What would be their foundation?</p>
<p>Why is this foundation described as secret? {1.1.6}</p>
<p>“What is the emergence from sampuṭa?</p>
<p>What would be its defining characteristic?” {1.1.7}</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied, “These tantras are all the tantras. By the phrase all the tantras is meant the Guhyasamāja Tantra, and so forth. That which constitutes their foundation has been established—this is what is meant. Because this foundation is inaccessible to Viṣṇu, Śiva, Brahmā, hearers, and solitary buddhas, it is secret. This secret foundation is sampuṭa, whose nature is gnosis and skillful means. This (gnosis and means) itself is the emergence, which is the meditative absorption of sampuṭa—this is what is meant.Emergence means ‘arising.’ Such defines the intrinsic nature of all animate and inanimate things. Therefore it is their defining characteristic. {1.1.8}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, by the word sampuṭa—sampuṭa that is the foundation of all the tantras—Vajrasattva is meant. By the word secret is meant the secret character of encoding a mantra according to specified rules, of the empowerment ritual of the maṇḍala deities, and so forth. {1.1.9}</p>
<p>“Hear this tantra, explained by me, which has the nature of insight and means!</p>
<p>“First, one should meditate on emptiness</p>
<p>And remove the impurities of embodied beings</p>
<p>By considering their constituent element of form as empty.</p>
<p>One should apply the same concept to sound, {1.1.10}</p>
<p>“And construe the constituent of sound as empty.</p>
<p>One should apply the same concept to smell,</p>
<p>And regard the constituent of smell as empty.</p>
<p>One should apply the same [concept] to taste, {1.1.11}</p>
<p>“And construe the constituent of taste as empty.</p>
<p>One should apply the same concept to tactility,</p>
<p>And construe the constituent of tactility as empty.</p>
<p>One should apply the same concept to mental objects.” {1.1.12}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“Since the eye by its nature is empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in its midst?</p>
<p>Since the ear by its nature is empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in its midst? {1.1.13}</p>
<p>“Since the nose by its nature is empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in its midst?</p>
<p>Since the tongue by its nature is empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in its midst? {1.1.14}</p>
<p>“Since the body by its nature is empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in its midst?</p>
<p>Since the mind and its objects are by nature empty,</p>
<p>How can consciousness arise in their midst? {1.1.15}</p>
<p>“It follows that there is neither form nor its perceiver,</p>
<p>No sound and no one who hears,</p>
<p>No smell and also no one who smells,</p>
<p>No taste and also no one who tastes, {1.1.16}</p>
<p>“No tactile sensation and no one who feels it,</p>
<p>And no mind and no thoughts.” {1.1.17}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Understand that the truth, just like the path,</p>
<p>Is nondual—devoid of duality.</p>
<p>It cannot be reasoned out or apprehended,</p>
<p>And it is difficult to awaken to for intellectuals. {1.1.18}</p>
<p>“It is the secret of all buddhas,</p>
<p>Equivalent to empty space.</p>
<p>The hearers do not know it,</p>
<p>Since they are enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. {1.1.19}</p>
<p>“The knowledge that leads to the removal of habitual tendencies</p>
<p>Can be formed by solitary buddhas.</p>
<p>But even they, without exception, do not know</p>
<p>The secret that is accessible only to buddhas. {1.1.20}</p>
<p>“It is among embodied beings,</p>
<p>Whose minds are turned toward liberation</p>
<p>From the terror of the ocean of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>That the aim of liberation is taught. {1.1.21}</p>
<p>“One should identify the characteristics of the target,</p>
<p>Targeting the consciousness with the faculty of gnosis.</p>
<p>Through gnosis one should cognize that which needs to be known,</p>
<p>Investigating the possible destinies as knowables, {1.1.22}</p>
<p>“Because if one thus investigates the destiny,</p>
<p>One can choose its course according to one’s wish.</p>
<p>Before one became a practitioner, one had followed</p>
<p>The course of consecutive births thousands of times. {1.1.23}</p>
<p>“A wise person, however, reflecting on equality</p>
<p>In terms of the empty characteristic as previously taught,</p>
<p>Will plant the seed of the empty body</p>
<p>In the field of the physical body and the like. {1.1.24}</p>
<p>“Emerging from the sublime crown of the subtle energy channels,</p>
<p>It is said to be completely pure.</p>
<p>It is the luminous bodhicitta,</p>
<p>Which resembles a translucent crystal. {1.1.25}</p>
<p>“It is an entity comprising the five wisdoms,</p>
<p>The size of a mustard seed.</p>
<p>Inside it there is the deity</p>
<p>In both its manifest and unmanifest forms. {1.1.26}</p>
<p>“Half of it is the mother. It is extremely subtle;</p>
<p>It has the form of a drop and consists of mind.</p>
<p>It always resides in the heart,</p>
<p>Has the luster of a star, and has a great brilliance. {1.1.27}</p>
<p>“It abides in the center of the navel,</p>
<p>And, if stretched out as a single thread,</p>
<p>It would reach, at the end of twelve units,</p>
<p>The soles of the feet, and, at the end of nine units, the head. {1.1.28}</p>
<p>“Its fifth part alone, in its full form,</p>
<p>Is like the king of nāgas.</p>
<p>When this part expands,</p>
<p>It emerges into the center of the vajra. {1.1.29}</p>
<p>“The seed that is inside the womb</p>
<p>Is the liquefied sphere of phenomena.</p>
<p>Its gradual movement</p>
<p>Is always toward the nine doors.</p>
<p>“The same goes for fire, which consists of Brahmā. {1.1.30}</p>
<p>“Two earth seed syllables</p>
<p>Should be applied to the eyes.</p>
<p>The blazing seed syllable is applied to the crown.</p>
<p>Seed syllables of wind, space, and so forth,</p>
<p>Are mentally applied to the nose, ears, and so forth. {1.1.31}</p>
<p>“The seed syllable of ambrosia-water is applied to the tongue,</p>
<p>The supreme deity and lord of all sense faculties.</p>
<p>The seed syllable of delusion is applied to the neck.</p>
<p>Likewise, the seed syllable of the afflictions is applied to the two arms. {1.1.32}</p>
<p>“The seed syllable of motility is applied to the area of the heart.</p>
<p>The ‘two beasts’ are at the two bases of the navel.</p>
<p>One who knows the ritual procedure should wear</p>
<p>These eight seed syllables on the eight bodily limbs. {1.1.33}</p>
<p>“That which pervades and that which is pervaded, the whole world,</p>
<p>With its inanimate and animate things,</p>
<p>And its gods and demigods, starting from Brahmā,</p>
<p>Becomes a receptacle for this bodhicitta. {1.1.34}</p>
<p>“It is said that the bhaga is the home</p>
<p>Where the lord dwells.</p>
<p>It will be the seat of action and inaction</p>
<p>For as long as one remains in the body. {1.1.35}</p>
<p>“Doing all kinds of things, one accumulates karma.</p>
<p>This can be of any kind, good or bad.</p>
<p>The method (yoga) is said to be the actualization of the sameness of phenomena;</p>
<p>The application (yuñjāna) is the meditation. {1.1.36}</p>
<p>“When the karmic aspect of the body is destroyed,</p>
<p>Such a body becomes the deity.</p>
<p>One’s own generative power, for its part, is derived from this body—</p>
<p>This deity body permeates everything inanimate and animate. {1.1.37}</p>
<p>“One should know the color of this body</p>
<p>To resemble, accordingly, the sky.</p>
<p>The hero, abiding in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Is free of stains and impurities. {1.1.38}</p>
<p>“One should worship one’s mother and sister—</p>
<p>So, too, one’s daughter or a female relative,</p>
<p>A brahmin or a kṣatriya woman,</p>
<p>Or one from the vaiśya or śūdra caste, {1.1.39}</p>
<p>“An artiste, a washerwoman, a musician,</p>
<p>Or an outcaste. These women should be worshiped</p>
<p>Through the ritual procedure of skillful means and insight</p>
<p>By one who is devoted to the truth. {1.1.40}</p>
<p>“She should be served with diligence</p>
<p>In such a way that the secret is not disclosed.</p>
<p>Should it be done in the open, there could be</p>
<p>Problems with snakes, thieves, and others who roam the earth. {1.1.41}</p>
<p>“The female consorts (mudrā) are said to be of five types,</p>
<p>Classified according to the division of families.</p>
<p>A brahmin woman, being from the family of the twice born,</p>
<p>Is thought to belong to the tathāgata family. {1.1.42}</p>
<p>“A kṣatriya woman of royal blood,</p>
<p>Born into the clans of Peacock, Moon, and so forth,</p>
<p>Is said to be Amṛtavajrā. {1.1.43}</p>
<p>“A vaiśya woman or a cowherdess</p>
<p>Is thought to belong to the activity (karma) family.</p>
<p>A śūdra or a low caste woman</p>
<p>Is thought to belong to Vairocana. {1.1.44}</p>
<p>“An artiste belongs to the lotus family,</p>
<p>And a washerwoman to the activity family.</p>
<p>A singer belongs to the vajra family,</p>
<p>And a female outcaste to the jewel family. {1.1.45}</p>
<p>“Now that the five seals are ascertained,</p>
<p>The one family of all tathāgatas</p>
<p>Will be briefly explained. {1.1.46}</p>
<p>“A tathāgata, a thus-gone one, is a glorious being</p>
<p>Who has attained or arrived at ‘thatness.’</p>
<p>A tathāgata is thus defined</p>
<p>Based on his insight. {1.1.47}</p>
<p>“This one family is said to have five,</p>
<p>One hundred, or infinite divisions.</p>
<p>Further, the tathāgatas are grouped into three categories</p>
<p>According to the division of body, speech, and mind. {1.1.48}</p>
<p>“The families are the five elements</p>
<p>And they also have the nature of the five aggregates.</p>
<p>Thus they are families with successive generations who hold</p>
<p>A vajra scepter, a wheel, a jewel, a lotus, and a sword. {1.1.49}</p>
<p>“There is no meditator and nothing to meditate on;</p>
<p>There is no mantra and no deity.</p>
<p>One should establish these two—the mantra and the deity—</p>
<p>To be the very nature of freedom from mental elaborations. {1.1.50}</p>
<p>“Vairocana, Akṣobhya, and Amoghasiddhi,</p>
<p>Along with Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, and Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>And also Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva—all of them</p>
<p>Are said to be awakened to the same reality. {1.1.51}</p>
<p>“Brahmā is a buddha because of his emancipation;</p>
<p>Viṣṇu is so named after his entry;</p>
<p>Śiva is so called because of his constant auspiciousness.</p>
<p>Each of them abides in his respective nature. {1.1.52}</p>
<p>“Reality is endowed with genuine bliss.</p>
<p>One is awakened through waking up to pleasure.</p>
<p>Because it originates in the body (deha),</p>
<p>It is called deity (devatā). {1.1.53}</p>
<p>“He who possesses grace (bhaga)</p>
<p>Is called Blessed One (bhagavān).</p>
<p>Six types of grace are described.</p>
<p>They are all qualities, starting with mastery. {1.1.54}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, Blessed One means</p>
<p>‘He who has destroyed the afflictions,’ and so forth.</p>
<p>Wisdom (prajñā) is called mother</p>
<p>Because she gives birth to the people of the world. {1.1.55}</p>
<p>“Wisdom is also called sister</p>
<p>Because she betokens a dowry.</p>
<p>Wisdom is called washerwoman</p>
<p>Because she delights all beings.</p>
<p>Accordingly, she is called rajakī. {1.1.56}</p>
<p>“Wisdom is called daughter (duhitṛ)</p>
<p>Because she suckles (duhana) the milk of qualities.</p>
<p>Wisdom is called artiste</p>
<p>On account of being moved by great compassion. {1.1.57}</p>
<p>“Since it is not possible to touch the deity-goddess (bhagavatī),</p>
<p>An untouchable female musician takes on the same name, bhagavatī.</p>
<p>Speaking is called mantra recitation</p>
<p>Because it involves uttering vowels and consonants. {1.1.58}</p>
<p>“A maṇḍala is a drawing made by the feet.</p>
<p>Because it thus involves grinding (malana), it is called maṇḍala.</p>
<p>The movement of hands is mudrā,</p>
<p>As is the snapping of fingers. {1.1.59}</p>
<p>“Since thought is what is be meditated upon,</p>
<p>The thinking process should be the object of meditation.</p>
<p>One should enjoy for oneself</p>
<p>Whatever bliss is obtained from the father. {1.1.60}</p>
<p>“Any bliss through which one might die</p>
<p>Is, in present circumstances, said to be meditation.” {1.1.61}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the first chapter, explaining the title, the subject matter, the generation of bodhicitta, and so forth, as well as the principle of meditation.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Now I will teach the thirty-seven auxiliary factors of awakening.</p>
<p>“The following are the four applications of mindfulness:</p>
<p>“From observing the body—dwelling upon the inner body, the outer body, and both the inner and outer body simultaneously—one reaches an understanding and becomes mindful of the world of beings who require guidance, dejected on account of their ignorance. {1.2.1}</p>
<p>“From observing the sensations—dwelling upon the inner sensations, the outer sensations, and both the inner and outer sensations simultaneously—one reaches an understanding and becomes mindful of the world of beings who require guidance, dejected on account of their ignorance. {1.2.2}</p>
<p>“From observing phenomena—dwelling upon inner phenomena, outer phenomena, and both inner and outer phenomena simultaneously—one reaches an understanding and becomes mindful of the world of beings who require guidance, dejected on account of their ignorance. {1.2.3}</p>
<p>“From observing the mind—dwelling upon the inner mind, the outer mind, and both the inner and outer minds simultaneously—one reaches an understanding and becomes mindful of the world of beings who require guidance, dejected on account of their ignorance. {1.2.4}</p>
<p>“These are the four applications of mindfulness. {1.2.5}</p>
<p>“Now, for the four right exertions, one forms a strong wish that evil and unwholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen may not arise. One strives for this, takes up discipline for its sake, reins in one’s thoughts, and makes a genuine resolution toward this end. {1.2.6}</p>
<p>“One forms a strong wish for the removal of evil and unwholesome dharmas that have already arisen. One strives for this, takes up discipline for its sake, reins in one’s thoughts, and makes a genuine resolution toward this end. {1.2.7}</p>
<p>“One forms a strong wish that wholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen may arise. One strives for this, takes up discipline for its sake, reins in one’s thoughts, and makes a genuine resolution toward this end. {1.2.8}</p>
<p>“In the same way, one forms a strong wish—one which increases by cultivating it more and more—for the wholesome dharmas that have arisen to remain, for complete fulfillment through the cultivation of immeasurable skillful means, and for the complete fulfillment of that which has not yet been fulfilled. One strives for this, takes up discipline for its sake, reins in one’s thoughts, and makes a genuine resolution to this end. {1.2.9}</p>
<p>“These are the four right exertions. {1.2.10}</p>
<p>“Now, for the four bases of miraculous power, one cultivates the miraculous power of the samādhi of aspiration accompanied by the formation of relinquishment. This involves renunciation based on discrimination, the absence of desire, and the cessation of afflictions, leading to refinement in which one thinks, ‘May my aspiration not be too slack, may it not be too taut.’ {1.2.11}</p>
<p>“One cultivates the miraculous power of the samādhi of diligence accompanied by the formation of relinquishment. This involves renunciation based on discrimination, the absence of desire, and the cessation of afflictions, leading to refinement in which one thinks, ‘May my diligence not be too slack, may it not be too taut.’ {1.2.12}</p>
<p>“One cultivates the miraculous power of the samādhi of investigation accompanied by the formation of relinquishment. This involves renunciation based on discrimination, the absence of desire, and the cessation of afflictions, leading to refinement in which one thinks, ‘May my investigation not be too slack, may it not be too taut.’ {1.2.13}</p>
<p>“One cultivates the miraculous power of the samādhi of mental activity accompanied by the formation of relinquishment. This involves renunciation based on discrimination, the absence of desire, and the cessation of afflictions, leading to refinement in which one thinks, ‘May my mental activity not be too slack, may it not be too taut.’ {1.2.14}</p>
<p>“These are the four bases of miraculous power. {1.2.15}</p>
<p>“Now, for the five faculties, one places one’s faith in the worldly correct view that is valid in the realm of desire. This means to develop conviction in the ripening of one’s karma. With the thought, ‘Whatever acts I am going to commit, whether wholesome or unwholesome, I acknowledge that they will bear results,’ one does not commit unwholesome acts even at the risk of losing one’s life. This is called the faculty of faith. {1.2.16}</p>
<p>“One acquires by means of the faculty of diligence whatever qualities one places one’s faith in using the faculty of faith. This is called the faculty of diligence. {1.2.17}</p>
<p>“With the faculty of mindfulness one is not in danger of destroying whatever qualities were acquired by means of the faculty of diligence. This is called the faculty of mindfulness. {1.2.18}</p>
<p>“One brings one-pointed focus with the faculty of samādhi to the qualities that are safeguarded by the faculty of mindfulness. This is called the faculty of samādhi. {1.2.19}</p>
<p>“One fully comprehends with the faculty of insight the qualities that one contemplates one-pointedly with the faculty of samādhi. This is called the faculty of insight. {1.2.20}</p>
<p>“These five faculties develop into five powers, namely, (1) the power of faith, (2) the power of diligence, (3) the power of mindfulness, (4) the power of samādhi, and (5) the power of insight. These are the five powers. {1.2.21}</p>
<p>“What in this list of thirty-seven factors are the seven aids to awakening? They are (1) the mindfulness aid to awakening, (2) the examination of phenomena aid to awakening, (3) the diligence aid to awakening, (4) the contentment aid to awakening, (5) the serenity aid to awakening, (6) the samādhi aid to awakening, and (7) the equanimity aid to awakening. These involve renunciation based on discrimination, the absence of desire, and cessation, and lead to total refinement in which one becomes completely free of afflictions. One should cultivate these seven aids to awakening, the examination of phenomena, and so forth. {1.2.22}</p>
<p>“And what is the noble eightfold path? The correct view, which transcends the mundane sphere, is not being motivated by the belief in a soul (ātman). It is being motivated instead by the belief that there is no being (sattva), psyche (jīva), spirit (poṣa), person (puruṣa, pudgala), human (manuja, mānava), agent (kāraka), or experiencer (vedaka); no annihilation or eternal enduring; no existence or nonexistence; and no distinction between virtuous and nonvirtuous, all the way up to no saṃsāra and no nirvāṇa. This is called the correct view. {1.2.23}</p>
<p>“Thoughts (saṃkalpa) through which arise the afflictions of desire, hatred, and delusion, are thoughts that one should avoid. Thoughts through which arise an abundance of morality, meditative absorption, insight, liberation, and vision into the wisdom of liberation, are thoughts that one should have. These are called correct thoughts. {1.2.24}</p>
<p>“One should use speech that hurts neither oneself nor others, causes no distress to oneself or others, and is not derisive of oneself or others. By applying one’s attention to this one becomes endowed with this speech, through which one enters the correct noble path. This is called correct speech. {1.2.25}</p>
<p>“One should not commit acts that are negative, and whose results are negative. One should perform acts that are positive, and whose results are positive. One should not commit acts that are positive, but whose results are negative. One may commit acts that are negative, but whose results are positive and lead to reducing the negative. Relying on virtuous acts is the correct activity. This is called correct activity. {1.2.26}</p>
<p>“Correct livelihood is when one’s livelihood is restrained, like that of the noble ones, and strictly follows the tenets of virtue, when it is free of hypocrisy, when it does not involve too much talking, when it is not embellished by stories, when one’s conduct has moral integrity, when it does not involve envy of the gains of others, when one is content with one’s blameless gains, and when it is recommended by the noble ones. {1.2.27}</p>
<p>“One should avoid wrong effort, not recommended by the noble ones, that relies on desire, hatred, ignorance, and other afflictions. Instead, one should pursue the effort that brings one to the genuine truth of the noble ones’ path, lays out the path leading to nirvāṇa, and delivers one to each successive stage. This is called correct effort. {1.2.28}</p>
<p>“The mindfulness in which one’s repose is unshakable, one’s body is straight and not crooked, one is able to see the shortcomings, and so forth, of saṃsāra, and by which one is led to the path to nirvāṇa, is a non-forgetting that connects one to the correct path of the noble ones. This is called correct mindfulness. {1.2.29}</p>
<p>“A samādhi engaged in correctly is the meditative absorption by abiding in which one abides in the right way for the sake of liberating all beings and thus reaches nirvāṇa. This is called correct samādhi. {1.2.30}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva levels of Joyful, and so forth,</p>
<p>Which are enumerated as such,</p>
<p>Are the bodhisattva abodes,</p>
<p>Whose natures are the sense faculties, and so forth; {1.2.31}</p>
<p>“The abodes of all buddhas,</p>
<p>Which are the particular aspects of the aggregates, and so forth;</p>
<p>And are the ultimate vehicles of awakening</p>
<p>For buddhas and bodhisattvas. {1.2.32}</p>
<p>“When the subtle energy channels in this body</p>
<p>Become filled with the thirty-two types of bodhicitta,</p>
<p>The awakening of the sense faculties,</p>
<p>Aggregates, and elements will happen instantly, {1.2.33}</p>
<p>“For awakening is based in one’s own body</p>
<p>And nowhere else.</p>
<p>Only those steeped in ignorance</p>
<p>Regard awakening to be somewhere other than the body. {1.2.34}</p>
<p>“In one’s own body dwells great wisdom,</p>
<p>Free of all mental constructs.</p>
<p>Pervading all things,</p>
<p>It dwells in the body, but is not born of the body.” {1.2.35}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked, “What subtle energy channels are in the body?” {1.2.36}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “There are one hundred and twenty of them, corresponding to the divisions within the four cakras. The chief ones, those with bodhicitta as their innate nature, are thirty-two in number. They are:</p>
<p>“Abhedyā, Sūkṣmarūpā,</p>
<p>Divyā, Vāmā, Vāmanī,</p>
<p>Kūrmajā, Bhāvakī, Sekā,</p>
<p>Doṣā, Viṣṭā, Mātarī, {1.2.37}</p>
<p>“Śarvarī, Śītadā, Uṣmā,</p>
<p>Lalanā, Rasanā, Avadhūtī,</p>
<p>Pravaṇā, Hṛṣṭā, Varṇā,</p>
<p>Surūpiṇī, Sāmānyā, Hetudāyikā, {1.2.38}</p>
<p>“Viyogā, Premaṇī, Siddhā,</p>
<p>Pāvakī, Sumanas,</p>
<p>Trivṛttā, Kāminī, Gehā,</p>
<p>Caṇḍikā, and Māradārikā.” {1.2.39}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked, “Of what kind are these channels, O Blessed One?” {1.2.40}</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied, “They all are permutations of the threefold existence, and are entirely devoid of apprehended object and apprehending subject.” {1.2.41}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the first chapter, called “Applying Bodhicitta,” which includes a full exposition on the five faculties, the five powers, the seven aids to awakening, and the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>Then all the tathāgatas, having paid reverence and prostrated to the Blessed One, said, “Please teach us, O Blessed One, the secret, pithy wisdom that has no equal.” {1.3.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One, acknowledging the request made by all the tathāgatas, entered the meditative absorption called “the vajra lamp of wisdom that is the essence of all the tantras” and expounded this secret of all the tantras: {1.3.2}</p>
<p>“Always abiding in the pleasure of the supreme secret,</p>
<p>Which is of the nature of everything,</p>
<p>He is the being who comprises all buddhas—</p>
<p>Vajrasattva, the ultimate bliss. {1.3.3}</p>
<p>“For this Blessed One is union—</p>
<p>Eternal, stable, and supreme.</p>
<p>He manifests as Manmatha,</p>
<p>Always invincible by nature. {1.3.4}</p>
<p>“Because of their performance of different actions</p>
<p>People want different ritual procedures.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that Buddha Vajradhara and others</p>
<p>Are said to discipline sentient beings. {1.3.5}</p>
<p>“He, Vajrasattva, is all things,</p>
<p>Animate and inanimate, starting with all the buddhas.</p>
<p>He is the deity Ḍākinījālasaṃvara</p>
<p>Who is in union with all the buddhas. {1.3.6}</p>
<p>“Because of his being in this magical union,</p>
<p>Everything is perfect in every way.</p>
<p>Because of being trained by buddhas, and so forth,</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of beings is accomplished. {1.3.7}</p>
<p>“All the powers of women are accomplished</p>
<p>By means of different transformations, according to their natures.</p>
<p>Even women of bad conduct attain fulfillment</p>
<p>With every possible gain, pleasure, and enjoyment. {1.3.8}</p>
<p>“This consort (mudrā) with various magical powers</p>
<p>Is called ḍākinī in the language of the barbarians.</p>
<p>The verbal root ḍai, which means ‘traveling in the sky,’</p>
<p>Should be understood here as the etymology of ḍākinī. {1.3.9}</p>
<p>“Traveling throughout the entirety of space is a magical feat—</p>
<p>The name ḍākinī indicates that she can accomplish this.</p>
<p>In every way, she is the universal consort (mudrā),</p>
<p>Joining in union with every Saṃvara. {1.3.10}</p>
<p>“Vajra and Vajradhara (Vajra Holder),</p>
<p>Lotus and Padmadhara (Lotus Holder),</p>
<p>Jewel and Maṇidhara (Jewel Holder)—</p>
<p>These are the Saṃvaras and their respective families.” {1.3.11}</p>
<p>Now the Blessed One entered the meditative absorption called “the stainless seat of the overpowering ability of all the tathāgatas” and explained bodhicitta. {1.3.12}</p>
<p>“It is neither empty nor not empty,</p>
<p>Nor can it be in the middle between these two.</p>
<p>Its application is the perfection of insight</p>
<p>And its means is compassion itself. {1.3.13}</p>
<p>“Consequently, the perfection of insight,</p>
<p>With the skillful means of sublime compassion, is clarified.</p>
<p>With respect to phenomena free of conceptuality,</p>
<p>There is no entity and nothing to cultivate. {1.3.14}</p>
<p>“Also, one should perform all mental activity</p>
<p>Inclined toward nonconceptuality.</p>
<p>One’s thoughts for the benefit of beings</p>
<p>Will then lead to nonconceptual processes. {1.3.15}</p>
<p>“Phenomena all have the nature of the tathāgatas—</p>
<p>There is neither a possessor of qualities, nor the condition of being a quality.</p>
<p>This talk about phenomena is therefore</p>
<p>The same as the sound of an echo.” {1.3.16}</p>
<p>Then, because of the vast scope of qualities</p>
<p>Arising through the meditation of the Great Vehicle,</p>
<p>All the tathāgatas of the three times</p>
<p>Expressed their praise with this king of eulogies: {1.3.17}</p>
<p>“Homage to the king of yoga, the liberator of beings!</p>
<p>Homage to the meditator on oneness arising as the universal nature!</p>
<p>Homage to the destroyer of ignorance in the ocean of saṃsāra!</p>
<p>Homage to the revealer of the singular wisdom of all of reality!</p>
<p>I always offer my salutations.” {1.3.18}</p>
<p>The tathāgatas, paying reverence</p>
<p>And prostrating themselves again, said,</p>
<p>“Please give us, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>A single, condensed summary of all phenomena.” {1.3.19}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“One should follow any path that involves sense faculties</p>
<p>According to one’s natural disposition.</p>
<p>Without applying a focus</p>
<p>One should always remain concentrated. {1.3.20}</p>
<p>“Because the identity of everyone abides</p>
<p>As the aggregate of consciousness,</p>
<p>Some ordinary people and fools</p>
<p>Cannot comprehend it. {1.3.21}</p>
<p>“Both mind and thoughts are, by nature, thinking;</p>
<p>The consciousness takes on the nature of its knowables.</p>
<p>It is the agency in the case of things to be done</p>
<p>And, as regards qualities, it constitutes their cultivation. {1.3.22}</p>
<p>“For just as there is a single ocean for many streams,</p>
<p>So too, with all the multiplicity of qualities,</p>
<p>There is only one liberation</p>
<p>—No multiplicity can be here observed. {1.3.23}</p>
<p>“How this instruction is to be internalized can only be learned from the teacher’s mouth.” {1.3.24}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the first chapter—The Exposition on Reality.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“I will now teach</p>
<p>The conclusions common to all the tantras.</p>
<p>In all beings alike</p>
<p>There is a triangle of vast form, {1.4.1}</p>
<p>“Which is the foundation of them all,</p>
<p>Including Brahmā and the other gods and demigods.</p>
<p>It is Perfection of Insight,</p>
<p>In her form of conventional attributes. {1.4.2}</p>
<p>“It transcends sense objects;</p>
<p>It is found in every being’s heart.</p>
<p>Why would it need to be elaborated upon?</p>
<p>In short, it is awakening itself. {1.4.3}</p>
<p>“While the state of awakening is normally attained</p>
<p>After millions of uncountable eons,</p>
<p>You can attain it even in this birth</p>
<p>Through genuine bliss. {1.4.4}</p>
<p>“One will attain the state of Vajradhara,</p>
<p>The state of a universal emperor,</p>
<p>Or the eight great siddhis,</p>
<p>Or anything else desired by the mind. {1.4.5}</p>
<p>“Beings who are thoroughly bound</p>
<p>By the five major afflictions of</p>
<p>Ignorance, hatred, desire, pride, and envy</p>
<p>Are hurting themselves with their own limbs. {1.4.6}</p>
<p>“Beings who are bound by these are born</p>
<p>As denizens of saṃsāra, circling through the six destinies.</p>
<p>Deluded by afflictions,</p>
<p>They commit many evil deeds. {1.4.7}</p>
<p>“Therefore, in order to destroy the afflictions,</p>
<p>A method has been devised by the ingenious Buddha,</p>
<p>Who saw that suffering was of no use</p>
<p>For those mired in the ocean of saṃsāra. {1.4.8}</p>
<p>“ ‘Once I am transformed by insight and means,</p>
<p>The afflictions will become causes for liberation.’</p>
<p>This is the result to be aimed for,</p>
<p>The stainless light throughout the three realms. {1.4.9}</p>
<p>“Things partake of the nature</p>
<p>Of whatever they are to be cleansed with.</p>
<p>Because the function of fire is to consume fuel,</p>
<p>It is to be enjoyed as the sublime dance of the Conqueror. {1.4.10}</p>
<p>“Just these—the aggregates, the sense-fields,</p>
<p>And the elements—are the pure target.</p>
<p>The skillful one will strike them,</p>
<p>Just as a capable marksman strikes his enemy. {1.4.11}</p>
<p>“One should strike ignorance with the pure aspect of ignorance,</p>
<p>And likewise hatred with the pure aspect of hatred.</p>
<p>One should strike desire with the pure aspect of desire,</p>
<p>And one’s powerful pride with the pure aspect of pride. {1.4.12}</p>
<p>“One should strike envy with the pure aspect of envy.</p>
<p>Lord Vajradhara, for his part, is free of all these afflictions.</p>
<p>Struck by the pure aspects of his nature,</p>
<p>The five afflictions are pacified. {1.4.13}</p>
<p>“These five afflictions are the five families,</p>
<p>The five wisdoms, and the five buddhas.</p>
<p>From them are born Vajragarbha,</p>
<p>The wrathful deities, the three realms, and beings. {1.4.14}</p>
<p>“This very division of inner constituents</p>
<p>Can be learned, very clearly, from the teacher’s mouth.</p>
<p>Those beings who are bereft of a teacher</p>
<p>Do not learn it, nor the mantra or the mudrā. {1.4.15}</p>
<p>“So, in this Jambūdvīpa—</p>
<p>This pure triangle dwelt in by the Buddha—</p>
<p>In its central area shaped like the Sanskrit letter e</p>
<p>There is the syllable vam, and so we get evam. {1.4.16}</p>
<p>“In this delightful maṇḍala with its three corners</p>
<p>Emerges Vajrāralli.</p>
<p>This space is also called source of phenomena,</p>
<p>And the bhaga of all queens. {1.4.17}</p>
<p>“The lotus at its center</p>
<p>Has eight petals and a pericarp.</p>
<p>There the vowels and consonants reside in combination,</p>
<p>Arranged into eight classes. {1.4.18}</p>
<p>“These vowels and consonants, in the form of mantra,</p>
<p>Carry out a multitude of ritual acts for embodied beings.</p>
<p>These fifty letters alone</p>
<p>Constitute the Vedic scriptures, {1.4.19}</p>
<p>“And also the mantras, the tantras,</p>
<p>And the śāstras in their outer aspect.</p>
<p>These letters are by nature of indestructible essence—</p>
<p>There is nothing whatsoever other than them. {1.4.20}</p>
<p>“The joys of the classes a, ka, ca, ṭa, ta, pa, ya, and sa</p>
<p>Are also fifty in number.</p>
<p>Evenly fashioned, they are located</p>
<p>Within the lotus inside Vajrāralli. {1.4.21}</p>
<p>“They are known to be on each petal</p>
<p>In the eight directions.</p>
<p>In the center between them, on the stamen,</p>
<p>Is the supreme deity. {1.4.22}</p>
<p>“The letter a, the greatest letter, is surrounded</p>
<p>By the eight classes.</p>
<p>As the foremost among all letters,</p>
<p>It is the leader of the classes. {1.4.23}</p>
<p>“From this letter originate</p>
<p>All the mantras of embodied beings. {1.4.24}</p>
<p>“The magical powers of the sword, eye salve, foot ointment, magical pill,</p>
<p>Entry into subterranean realms, association with full-figured yakṣa women,</p>
<p>Ability to course throughout the three realms, and to act in accordance</p>
<p>With the properties of alchemical operations— {1.4.25}</p>
<p>“All those great magical powers, accompanied by genuine enjoyment</p>
<p>Of the five sense objects within one’s own abode,</p>
<p>Issue forth from within the eight classes of letters,</p>
<p>Specifically from the supreme sound, whose nature is the eight classes. {1.4.26}</p>
<p>“Whatever utterance of persons’ words</p>
<p>Is picked up by the listener</p>
<p>Is all the nature of mantra,</p>
<p>For it originates only from mantra. {1.4.27}</p>
<p>“This is because it is said that sound is mantra</p>
<p>For all embodied beings.</p>
<p>It emerges as Dharmāralli,</p>
<p>From the great place of the universal knot. {1.4.28}</p>
<p>“There is no fixity whatsoever with mantras</p>
<p>Used for siddhis or magical powers.</p>
<p>The mantra that is by nature unproduced</p>
<p>Is the supreme lord of the sound classes. {1.4.29}</p>
<p>“I will further teach the characteristics</p>
<p>Of the emergence from sampuṭa.</p>
<p>The letter e, known to be earth,</p>
<p>Is Locanā, the ‘seal of action’ (karmamudrā). {1.4.30}</p>
<p>“She is great compassion, omnifarious great means</p>
<p>Of unlimited scope.</p>
<p>She resides in the nirmāṇa cakra at the navel,</p>
<p>Inside a multicolored lotus. {1.4.31}</p>
<p>“The syllable vam, known to be water,</p>
<p>Is Māmakī, the ‘seal of phenomena’ (dharmamudrā).</p>
<p>Her nature is loving kindness and ardent good wishes.</p>
<p>She is the principal goddess of the vajra family. {1.4.32}</p>
<p>“She resides in the dharma cakra</p>
<p>At the heart, in an eight-petaled lotus.</p>
<p>The syllable ma, said to be fire,</p>
<p>Is Pāṇḍarā, the ‘great seal’ (mahāmudrā). {1.4.33}</p>
<p>“Endowed with power and sympathetic joy,</p>
<p>This goddess arises from the lotus family.</p>
<p>She resides in the sambhoga cakra</p>
<p>At the throat, in a sixteen-petaled lotus. {1.4.34}</p>
<p>“The syllable yā, the nature of wind,</p>
<p>Which thoroughly destroys all afflictions,</p>
<p>Is the chief goddess of the activity family,</p>
<p>The great ‘seal of the pledge’ (samayamudrā). {1.4.35}</p>
<p>“With her application of the wisdom of equanimity,</p>
<p>She is Tārā who ferries beings across the ocean of saṃsāra.</p>
<p>She resides in the mahāsukha cakra,</p>
<p>In a thirty-two-petaled lotus. {1.4.36}</p>
<p>“The letter e is known to be insight (prajñā)</p>
<p>And vaṃ is skillful means (upāya).</p>
<p>This letter e is adorned with the syllable vaṃ</p>
<p>And shines with a steady light. {1.4.37}</p>
<p>“Being arranged below and above,</p>
<p>They have the natures of insight and skillful means respectively.</p>
<p>The syllables e and vaṃ are always a pair,</p>
<p>And they are always pronounced as a pair. {1.4.38}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, with the adverbial particle evaṃ (thus) is expressed the totality of tantras, from their beginning to their end. The statement mayā śrutam (have I heard) is made because great passion continually dwells in this tantra. The syllable śru indicates hearing, and the syllable ta, Lord Mahāsukha (Great Bliss). In saying ‘only heard by me,’ the narrator means that it was heard with his ear consciousness, but not directly realized. It has been, however, realized by the Blessed One, so nothing is amiss.” {1.4.39}</p>
<p>The Blessed One continued, “There is no distinction between the recounter of the teaching and the teacher. Or, rather, realization is only from the perspective of the person to be guided, so that the teacher could himself be the recounter: {1.4.40}</p>
<p>“ ‘I am the teacher and I am the teaching;</p>
<p>I am also the recipient, part of my assembly.’</p>
<p>How should this be understood? {1.4.41}</p>
<p>“Wherever Lord Mahāsukha dances, he is playing by means of language with singular and multiple modes of expression. Whatever has been taught by the Blessed One, O sons of noble family, that ‘I have heard at one time,’ that is to say, on a particular occasion. This implies that I have realized it. This statement indicates the attainment of the meditative absorption of complete confidence in the inconceivable. {1.4.42}</p>
<p>“ ‘Occasion’ is called time,</p>
<p>And time is of three types—</p>
<p>Pleasurable time, painful time,</p>
<p>And inconceivable time. {1.4.43}</p>
<p>“The pleasurable time is when bodhicitta enters</p>
<p>The passage of the nose like a stream of milk;</p>
<p>The painful time is when it departs in the form of fire.</p>
<p>Between these two ‘times,’ only the latter one is known. {1.4.44}</p>
<p>“Should the former one be unaccompanied by the latter,</p>
<p>Time will become inconceivable—</p>
<p>There will be neither desire, nor the absence of it,</p>
<p>Nor anything in between that can be ascertained. {1.4.45}</p>
<p>“Here, desire has the characteristic of ability (āśakti);</p>
<p>The absence of desire is thought to be cessation.</p>
<p>Since the in between, devoid of both, is inconceivable,</p>
<p>None of the three will be ascertained. {1.4.46}</p>
<p>“Desire and its absence,</p>
<p>When combined, are stainless.</p>
<p>Likewise, from desire and desirelessness combined</p>
<p>Comes the moment of one equal taste. {1.4.47}</p>
<p>“All entities are of equal taste. Bhagavān (one possessing grace) and samaya (time) are said to be one and the same.</p>
<p>“According to the tradition,</p>
<p>This grace (bhaga) consists of six aspects:</p>
<p>Complete power, form, fame,</p>
<p>Splendor, wisdom, and effort.</p>
<p>“He who has these six is called bhagavān (Blessed One). {1.4.48}</p>
<p>“An alternative interpretation is that a bhagavān is one who has destroyed (bhagnavān) all qualities inconducive to awakening. Another interpretation is that the body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas are the essence, this essence is the vajra, this vajra is the queen, and in the bhaga of this vajra queen dwelled the Blessed One. By addressing him he bhagavan (O Blessed One), one implies that he dwelled in the bhaga.” {1.4.49}</p>
<p>The Blessed One continued, “This means that the minds of people requiring guidance are captivated by various methods which, for every tathāgata, are of equal taste. ‘I heard his teaching when the Blessed One was dwelling in the source of phenomena, which has the nature of [the bhaga of] vajra queens, who, in turn, are the essence of the body, speech, and mind of all the tathāgatas.’ This is how it is: since afflictions are destroyed by insight—afflictions which themselves are devoid of insight—the insight is called bhaga. In this bhaga dwells every tathāgata together with his queen. {1.4.50}</p>
<p>“It is indeed due to the supreme omniscient</p>
<p>Wisdom of all the buddhas</p>
<p>That in order to experience the bliss of a tathāgata</p>
<p>You should take a consort and pay homage to her. {1.4.51}</p>
<p>“O sons of noble family! The letters of the phrase evaṃ mayā śrutam (thus have I heard) are always formed (saṃsthita) at the beginning of a Dharma teaching. These pure letters, which bring the accomplishment of full awakening, and which are ineffable, O Vajrapāṇi, have been spoken by me. By means of these letters, beings reach the other shore of saṃsāra, so distant. Having repeatedly put this goal in front of yourself, you will, with your mind set on it, attain the state of awakening or the state of Vajrasattva in this birth. {1.4.52}</p>
<p>“Beings can attain this inconceivable state, which is not attained even by the bliss-gone ones. Beings can become buddhas when correctly instructed and when the goal is set. By mere self-indulgence they would fall into Avīci hell. They should therefore abandon being afflicted by afflictive thoughts. Fine practitioners, who are beyond the fear of saṃsāric existence, will meditate with a pristine mind. In this way, through the application of skillful means and insight, they will attain the true and pristine state, whose character is the nature of original awareness. Through the transformative power of insight and skillful means, they will become equal to space, illuminating the three realms. This goal is difficult to attain, universally present, and free of causes and conditions. Acting in the world on behalf of oneself and others like a wish-fulfilling gem is, of all siddhis, the supreme one.” {1.4.53}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign first chapter of the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa,” so called to reflect the secret foundation of all tantras.</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>“I will now explain,</p>
<p>For the benefit of practitioners,</p>
<p>By what method the disciple is initiated,</p>
<p>And also the general ritual procedure. {2.1.1}</p>
<p>“First, the officiating yogin, assuming the identity of the deity,</p>
<p>Should purify the ground,</p>
<p>Diligently making it into vajra by means of the syllable hūṁ.</p>
<p>He should next draw the maṇḍala. {2.1.2}</p>
<p>“In a garden, a secluded place,</p>
<p>The abode of a bodhisattva,</p>
<p>An empty enclosure, or a residence</p>
<p>He should delimit a splendid circle. {2.1.3}</p>
<p>“He should trace it with sublime powders.</p>
<p>Alternatively, he should do it with middling materials—</p>
<p>Powders of the five precious substances,</p>
<p>Rice flour, or something similar. {2.1.4}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala should be three cubits</p>
<p>Plus three thumb-widths in diameter.</p>
<p>Into this maṇḍala should be brought four sublime consorts (vidyā),</p>
<p>Who originate from the five buddha families. {2.1.5}</p>
<p>“When, in his pursuit of the path of mantra,</p>
<p>An able disciple is initiated</p>
<p>In the presence of all the buddhas,</p>
<p>In a maṇḍala, which is the abode of the bliss-gone ones, {2.1.6}</p>
<p>“He should be able, in addition,</p>
<p>To behold the goddess of infinite world spheres</p>
<p>If this wise disciple has reached the state of self-consecration</p>
<p>And is anxious not to violate his samaya. {2.1.7}</p>
<p>“It has also been taught by the fully awakened ones</p>
<p>In the mantra vehicle that from the perspective of absolute truth</p>
<p>The samaya of Vajrasattva and other deities</p>
<p>Should not be taken lightly. {2.1.8}</p>
<p>“For that reason, a son of the victorious ones</p>
<p>Should, with every precaution and care,</p>
<p>Approach, according to protocol,</p>
<p>A vajra master, who is an ocean of qualities, about the initiation. {2.1.9}</p>
<p>“Optionally, he should choose, as available,</p>
<p>A mother, an older sister, a younger sister,</p>
<p>A daughter, or a niece</p>
<p>And do the right practice with her. {2.1.10}</p>
<p>“But if these consorts (vidyā) are not physically available,</p>
<p>He can then take other women,</p>
<p>Praised by the omniscient one,</p>
<p>And specified by the buddhas: {2.1.11}</p>
<p>“A brahmin’s daughter, a washerwoman, an outcast, a musician, a high caste woman, a princess, a daughter of an artiste, or a craftswoman. She should have the eyes of a doe, a slender waist, wide hips, and taut breasts. She should have a fine bhaga, and be strict in her observance of samaya, clever, honest, and conversant with mantra and tantra. These girls are said to be, in the whole triple universe, invaluable to superior practitioners. With them, every accomplishment will be attained, precisely according to the sequence of the families. {2.1.12}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he can also take</p>
<p>For a consort (mudrā) a sixteen-year-old girl,</p>
<p>As may be available, endowed with</p>
<p>The freshness of youth and beautiful eyes. {2.1.13}</p>
<p>“Having selected such a consort (vidyā), he should purify her</p>
<p>Through the procedure of going for refuge, and so forth,</p>
<p>And explain to her the secret reality</p>
<p>And all the stages of mantra and tantra. {2.1.14}</p>
<p>“Optionally, with sounds of passion and his tongue</p>
<p>In the nether region, he should place her on top.</p>
<p>Likewise, he should perform in succession</p>
<p>The full repertory of advanced positions. {2.1.15}</p>
<p>“The consort (vidyā), who is adorned with earrings,</p>
<p>Waist chain, pearl necklace, anklets,</p>
<p>Bracelets, and so forth, being thus purified,</p>
<p>Bestows the supreme accomplishment. {2.1.16}</p>
<p>“The partner of the consort (vidyā) and his companions,</p>
<p>In a place free from disturbances,</p>
<p>Should adorn themselves with garlands, sandalwood paste,</p>
<p>Clothes, and so forth, and announce themselves to the master. {2.1.17}</p>
<p>“Using gifts of perfume, chaplets, and so forth,</p>
<p>Along with generous offerings of milk, and so forth,</p>
<p>The initiate should worship with devotion,</p>
<p>Eagerly offering to the master his consort (mudrā). {2.1.18}</p>
<p>“As a disciple, he should, with devotion,</p>
<p>Place his knee on the ground</p>
<p>And with palms joined beseech</p>
<p>The preceptor with the following praise: {2.1.19}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, O womb of emptiness,</p>
<p>Free of all mental constructs!</p>
<p>Homage and praise to you, body of wisdom</p>
<p>Whose mass is omniscient wisdom! {2.1.20}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, destroyer of ignorance in the world,</p>
<p>Instructor on the pure meaning of reality,</p>
<p>Diamond being born from</p>
<p>The absence of self in phenomena! {2.1.21}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, O lord bodhicitta,</p>
<p>From which always emerge</p>
<p>The fully awakened ones and bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>With their qualities of the six perfections! {2.1.22}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, hero of the world,</p>
<p>From whom originate the Three Jewels, the Great Vehicle,</p>
<p>All animate and inanimate things,</p>
<p>And this entire triple universe! {2.1.23}</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, O venerable son of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Who manifests like a wish-fulfilling gem,</p>
<p>Carrying out the orders of the bliss-gone ones</p>
<p>To accomplish the wishes of the world. {2.1.24}</p>
<p>“ ‘O omniscient one, please grant me this favor:</p>
<p>Bestow upon me the vajra empowerment without delay</p>
<p>So that I can understand,</p>
<p>Through your power and merit, the highest truth. {2.1.25}</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as the secret of all the buddhas</p>
<p>Was shown to Vajradharmin</p>
<p>By the venerable Cittavajra,</p>
<p>In the same way, O lord, be kind to me! {2.1.26}</p>
<p>“ ‘Apart from your lotus feet,</p>
<p>There is no other path for me.</p>
<p>Therefore, please have compassion, O lord,</p>
<p>You who have conquered the wanderings of saṃsāra!’ {2.1.27}</p>
<p>“Next, the venerable vajra master,</p>
<p>Full of kindness and altruism,</p>
<p>Should generate compassion for the disciple</p>
<p>And summon him into the maṇḍala of the assembly— {2.1.28}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala overflowing with the five objects of desire,</p>
<p>Brightened with an outstretched canopy,</p>
<p>Composed of yoginīs and yogins,</p>
<p>Filled with the soft sounds of the bell, {2.1.29}</p>
<p>“Pleasant with flowers, incense, and unguents,</p>
<p>Delightful with garlands and the enjoyments of gods—</p>
<p>This maṇḍala of Vajrasattva and other deities,</p>
<p>Which is marvelous in the highest degree. {2.1.30}</p>
<p>“Having united with the consort (mudrā),</p>
<p>The master, supremely pleased,</p>
<p>Should place in a lotus dish</p>
<p>The bodhicitta born of the son of the victorious ones. {2.1.31}</p>
<p>“Using raised yak-tail whisks and parasols,</p>
<p>And singing songs with auspicious verses,</p>
<p>The lord of the world (i.e., the master) should initiate</p>
<p>The disciple by having him join with the consort (mudrā). {2.1.32}</p>
<p>“Having bestowed the initiation, the true jewel,</p>
<p>The master, the supreme lord,</p>
<p>Should also bestow the samaya—</p>
<p>Exquisite, sublime, and pure in nature. {2.1.33}</p>
<p>“It consists of great blood (human blood) and camphor (semen),</p>
<p>Mixed with red sandalwood (human flesh),</p>
<p>And blended with vajra water (urine).</p>
<p>The fifth ingredient derives from the mind (citta, semen). {2.1.34}</p>
<p>“This samaya has been duly</p>
<p>Taught by all buddhas—</p>
<p>Please guard this auspicious samaya at all times.</p>
<p>Now listen about the vows. {2.1.35}</p>
<p>“You must not kill living beings.</p>
<p>You should not give up the jewel of women.</p>
<p>You should not abandon your master.</p>
<p>These vows must not be violated. {2.1.36}</p>
<p>“The wisdom consort (vidyā) that was described before —</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, his own yoginī,</p>
<p>Purified and fashioned into the wisdom consort (vidyā)—</p>
<p>Should be anointed with olibanum and camphor. {2.1.37}</p>
<p>“He should make love to her</p>
<p>Until she releases her sexual fluid.</p>
<p>Having covered the face of the female consort (mudrā)</p>
<p>And the face of the male consort, {2.1.38}</p>
<p>“The master should place the substance</p>
<p>Produced through love-making into the disciple’s mouth.</p>
<p>At that point the experience of equal taste</p>
<p>Will be produced within his range of perception. {2.1.39}</p>
<p>“His self-awareness will become gnosis,</p>
<p>Devoid of discrimination between self and other.</p>
<p>Pure and empty like the sky,</p>
<p>It is the ultimate nature of existence and nonexistence. {2.1.40}</p>
<p>“It is a combination of insight and skillful means,</p>
<p>A mixture of passion and its absence—</p>
<p>This alone is the living breath of living beings;</p>
<p>This alone is the supreme syllable. {2.1.41}</p>
<p>“This breath pervades everything;</p>
<p>It alone possesses the gnosis of the buddhas.</p>
<p>It is said to be the glorious Heruka;</p>
<p>From it arise existence and nonexistence,</p>
<p>And every other entity. {2.1.42}</p>
<p>“The first joy is the hero, the male partner.</p>
<p>The supreme joy is the yoginī, the female partner.</p>
<p>The joy of sexual bliss is all things combined—</p>
<p>Its pleasure is the means leading to omniscience. {2.1.43}</p>
<p>“The first of the four joys is merely called joy.</p>
<p>The supreme joy is counted as the second.</p>
<p>The third is called the joy of cessation,</p>
<p>And the fourth is known as the innate joy. {2.1.44}</p>
<p>“Accordingly, the initiation is also fourfold:</p>
<p>“The first is the vase initiation,</p>
<p>The second is the secret initiation,</p>
<p>The third is the gnosis initiation with the consort (prajñā),</p>
<p>And the fourth is the same again. {2.1.45}</p>
<p>“When the disciple is free of impurities</p>
<p>By means of the initiation of bodhicitta,</p>
<p>He should be given, before the supreme</p>
<p>City of the buddhas, the following command: {2.1.46}</p>
<p>“ ‘Until the final attainment of awakening,</p>
<p>In the circle of the compass all around,</p>
<p>May you turn the supreme wheel of Dharma</p>
<p>In every quarter up to the farthermost reaches. {2.1.47}</p>
<p>“ ‘Embodying the nature of insight and skillful means,</p>
<p>Like a wish-fulfilling gem high above,</p>
<p>Untiring and without attachment,</p>
<p>Please work for the benefit of beings without delay.’ {2.1.48}</p>
<p>“Having now obtained the initiation and the master’s order,</p>
<p>Fully content through having done what needed to be done,</p>
<p>He should speak the following sweet words,</p>
<p>Which bring joy to the world: {2.1.49}</p>
<p>“ ‘Now my birth has become fruitful,</p>
<p>And my life has borne fruit.</p>
<p>Now I have been born into the family of the Buddha—</p>
<p>Right now I am the Buddha’s son. {2.1.50}</p>
<p>“ ‘From the turmoil of being born in Avīci hell,</p>
<p>Where there is great terror for oceans of eons,</p>
<p>I have been saved, O lord, by you—</p>
<p>Saved from the quagmire of afflictions, so difficult to cross. {2.1.51}</p>
<p>“ ‘Because of your grace, I know myself</p>
<p>To be manifested in full, as it were.</p>
<p>Being freed from all habitual tendencies,</p>
<p>In the state of complete awakening I have no desires.’ {2.1.52}</p>
<p>“The disciple should fall with devotion at the master’s feet,</p>
<p>Joyful, with eyes wide open,</p>
<p>And whatever thing is most pleasing to the master,</p>
<p>He should offer it to him without expectations. {2.1.53}</p>
<p>“The master, for his part,</p>
<p>Should listen, full of compassion,</p>
<p>For the sake of removing the disciple’s grasping</p>
<p>And for the sake of his welfare. {2.1.54}</p>
<p>“The disciple should then bow to and worship the master,</p>
<p>Offering to him the master’s fee—</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of gold pieces,</p>
<p>Jewels of various kinds, {2.1.55}</p>
<p>“And hundreds of pairs of garments;</p>
<p>Elephants, horses, the kingdom itself,</p>
<p>Earrings, bracelets,</p>
<p>Supreme necklaces, and finger rings; {2.1.56}</p>
<p>“A golden thread of a brahmin,</p>
<p>And even his wife and daughter;</p>
<p>Male and female slaves, and his own sister—</p>
<p>Having prostrated oneself, he should offer all this. {2.1.57}</p>
<p>“Prostrating before the master, he should offer himself</p>
<p>And all that exists with the following words:</p>
<p>‘From now on I am your servant,</p>
<p>Presented to you by myself.’ {2.1.58}</p>
<p>“In this way, he should further say:</p>
<p>‘The desired place has been reached;</p>
<p>Now the kind favor of all the buddhas</p>
<p>Is with me. {2.1.59}</p>
<p>“ ‘As I have accomplished, through your power,</p>
<p>The unsurpassable awakening,</p>
<p>I set up, in this perfect awakening,</p>
<p>The seat (pada) worshipped by all the exalted ones.</p>
<p>On this very seat, I will establish all beings</p>
<p>Dwelling throughout the threefold universe.’ {2.1.60}</p>
<p>“The initiation can only be given by a realized master (muni),</p>
<p>According to the procedure, after ascertaining the disciple’s dedication.</p>
<p>Such a master, dedicated to the vast and profound conduct,</p>
<p>Should give the precious initiation by speech alone. {2.1.61}</p>
<p>“He who has obtained the initiation becomes the most excellent Vajradhara,</p>
<p>Possessed of the unparalleled state, difficult to gain.</p>
<p>Having truly attained the splendor of the sambhogakāya field,</p>
<p>He has been conferred the great bodhicitta initiation. {2.1.62}</p>
<p>“Having obtained the master’s order, with an intellect that dons armor</p>
<p>For embarking upon conquest over the wicked foes throughout the three worlds,</p>
<p>The practitioner of truth should apply himself stainlessly</p>
<p>In this vast attitude set on awakening.” {2.1.63}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the second chapter, the bodhicitta initiation.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Now I will explain the meditation</p>
<p>Done for the sake of developing insight and skillful means—</p>
<p>I will explain it in order to benefit practitioners,</p>
<p>Whose energy is devoted to serving the interests of others. {2.2.1}</p>
<p>“The yogins, having practiced this meditation,</p>
<p>Do not remain in saṃsāra—this frightening ocean, difficult to cross—</p>
<p>Nor do they remain in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Which would merely be for their own sake. {2.2.2}</p>
<p>“By this meditation, at its exalted culmination,</p>
<p>They will attain unsurpassable awakening—</p>
<p>The wondrous awakening of the buddhas,</p>
<p>Free from waning or waxing. {2.2.3}</p>
<p>“They should neither relinquish phenomena, such as the five aggregates,</p>
<p>Nor should they transgress against the three vehicles.</p>
<p>They should perceive them to be empty like the plantain tree,</p>
<p>Absolutely equal in the expanse of phenomena. {2.2.4}</p>
<p>“A yogin should neither contemplate that entities are empty,</p>
<p>Nor that they are not empty.</p>
<p>Nor should a yogin abandon the thought that they are empty,</p>
<p>Or that they are not empty. {2.2.5}</p>
<p>“When there is grasping at things as ‘empty’ or ‘not empty,’</p>
<p>There will arise a lot of conceptual thoughts,</p>
<p>But when there is complete renunciation, there is no conceptual thought.</p>
<p>Therefore, he should abandon this duality of ‘empty’ and ‘not empty.’ {2.2.6}</p>
<p>“When he gives up dualistic grasping,</p>
<p>He is liberated—free of reference point.</p>
<p>Since ‘I’ is also a concept,</p>
<p>It should also be abandoned. {2.2.7}</p>
<p>“Without fluctuations, without doubts,</p>
<p>Without yearnings, the impurities gone,</p>
<p>Free of thoughts of a beginning and an end,</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should engage in a sky-like meditation. {2.2.8}</p>
<p>“But a compassionate practitioner also</p>
<p>Should never turn his back on living beings.</p>
<p>‘Beings exist’ or ‘beings do not exist’—</p>
<p>He should not speculate in this way. {2.2.9}</p>
<p>“The state characterized by the absence of mental elaboration</p>
<p>Has been proclaimed to be insight.</p>
<p>Compassion is bringing about the welfare of all beings,</p>
<p>Like a wish-fulfilling gem. {2.2.10}</p>
<p>“On the meditational level without reference</p>
<p>There is great compassion without reference.</p>
<p>This great compassion is one with insight,</p>
<p>Just like space contained within space. {2.2.11}</p>
<p>“Where there is no meditator,</p>
<p>There also is no meditation,</p>
<p>And no object to meditate upon—</p>
<p>This is called meditation on reality. {2.2.12}</p>
<p>“So, too, there is no action here,</p>
<p>And also nothing to partake of.</p>
<p>Free from the agent and the experiencer,</p>
<p>Such is meditation on the ultimate truth. {2.2.13}</p>
<p>“Nor is there a practitioner of any kind here,</p>
<p>Nor anyone who offers praise.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, nothing whatsoever to abandon</p>
<p>And nothing whatsoever to adopt. {2.2.14}</p>
<p>“This state has the nature of a city of gandharvas.</p>
<p>Similar to a magical display or a mirage,</p>
<p>And the same as the city of Hariścandra,</p>
<p>It is perceived as if it were play in a dream. {2.2.15}</p>
<p>“It is seen and touched</p>
<p>As an illusion in every way.</p>
<p>It is impossible to find</p>
<p>Lasting existence for any living being. {2.2.16}</p>
<p>“In the inconceivable commingling of union,</p>
<p>Which is like the conjunction of a dream and subsequent awakening,</p>
<p>There is a meeting of two sex organs,</p>
<p>The same as in the case of a divinely youthful form. {2.2.17}</p>
<p>“When one has placed the liṅga inside the bhaga,</p>
<p>This is the meditation of recollecting the buddhas—</p>
<p>A certain amount of wisdom will arise,</p>
<p>Stainless in the beginning, middle, and end. {2.2.18}</p>
<p>“This wisdom is self-reflexive awareness (svasaṃvedya);</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe this otherwise.</p>
<p>While perceiving all manner of forms,</p>
<p>While listening to sounds, {2.2.19}</p>
<p>“While talking, laughing,</p>
<p>Or tasting different tastes,</p>
<p>And while performing all kinds of actions</p>
<p>With the mind not wandering elsewhere, {2.2.20}</p>
<p>“There always arises nondual union (yoga)</p>
<p>For yogins who know reality.</p>
<p>This is called nonduality—</p>
<p>This is the ultimate bodhicitta. {2.2.21}</p>
<p>“This is vajra and glorious Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>The one who is fully awakened, and also awakening itself.</p>
<p>This is also the perfection of wisdom,</p>
<p>Which comprises all the perfections. {2.2.22}</p>
<p>“This is said to be equanimity,</p>
<p>The foremost meditation of all buddhas.</p>
<p>From within this very state everything arises—</p>
<p>The world’s animate and inanimate objects, {2.2.23}</p>
<p>“Infinite bodhisattvas, fully awakened buddhas,</p>
<p>Hearers, and so forth.</p>
<p>The yogin, disconnected from both existence and nonexistence,</p>
<p>Should cultivate this state only. {2.2.24}</p>
<p>“If he meditates, free from existence and nonexistence,</p>
<p>He will swiftly become accomplished,</p>
<p>Feeling distaste for all his faults,</p>
<p>And turning his back upon the afflictions. {2.2.25}</p>
<p>“The endless qualities of the glorious bliss-gone ones</p>
<p>Will arise from his meditation. {2.2.26}</p>
<p>“The mind, which is overcome by the darkness of many concepts,</p>
<p>Mad as a storm and fickle as lightning,</p>
<p>Stained with the dirt of unrestrainable desire, and so forth—</p>
<p>This mind has been declared by the vajra holder (Vajradhara) to be saṃsāra. {2.2.27}</p>
<p>“But the mind, which is luminous and free from conceptuality,</p>
<p>Which has lost its layer of the dirt of desire, and so forth,</p>
<p>Which lacks both the perceived and the perceiver—</p>
<p>This mind has been declared by the best of beings to be supreme nirvāṇa. {2.2.28}</p>
<p>“As a cause for the manifold heap of suffering,</p>
<p>There is nothing other than this mind.</p>
<p>And likewise, as a cause for the emergence of infinite happiness,</p>
<p>There is nothing other than this mind, O seekers of liberation! {2.2.29}</p>
<p>“Those who have resolved on the destruction of all suffering,</p>
<p>Who wish to obtain the genuine happiness of the fully awakened ones,</p>
<p>They should stabilize their minds and investigate with care,</p>
<p>Construing this mind to be devoid of independent existence. {2.2.30}</p>
<p>“For as long as the minds of beings who are subject to birth</p>
<p>Are hampered by the thick, dark veil of conceptual thinking,</p>
<p>Their suffering will be endless.</p>
<p>But as soon as their minds are free of this veil, {2.2.31}</p>
<p>“Their happiness will be immense and unequaled.</p>
<p>The noble ones should therefore exert themselves</p>
<p>For the sake of removing this veil—</p>
<p>They will then witness the great expansion of their happiness. {2.2.32}</p>
<p>“In this way, the practitioner of the true state (tattvayogin), resolved upon the practice, authorized by his master, and abiding by his samaya, should practice meditation. If he does, what would be the use of committing to practice hand mudrās, mantras, making deity statues, or cultivating himself as deity, all of which can only produce common siddhis? Intent on buddhahood, he should clearly set up his goal and do the practice of the chosen deity. In this way, when the goal has been reached, the threefold universe will become for him like the sky. Consequently, the skilled practitioner, having renounced everything, applies himself to the practice of meditation in the state he has attained, cultivating day and night self-reflexive awareness (saṃvedana) exclusively. {2.2.33}</p>
<p>“On a mountaintop, in a Śiva temple, in a lotus garden, on the ocean’s shore, in a royal park, in any secluded place, in his own home, in any place pleasing to the mind that is praised by the omniscient ones—in locations like these, in whatever place the adept of mantra may find himself—there he should practice meditation with tenacity. Awakening can never be directly attained without insight and skillful means. Therefore, if he abandons the wisdom consort (prajñā), the sublime lady who grants complete awakening, siddhis that are endowed with each of the seals (mudrā) will not be bestowed. For that reason, he should apply the four seals that give rise to wisdom. {2.2.34}</p>
<p>“Ignorance is the samayamudrā (seal of commitment). Hatred is always said to be the mahāmudrā (great seal), and envy the karmamudrā (seal of action). Desire is, by its nature, the dharmamudrā (seal of phenomena). The practitioner should manifest these different seals and sexually enjoy and serve his consort (prajñā), regarding them both (the seal and the consort) to be deity by nature. {2.2.35}</p>
<p>“Being tranquil because of ignorance, wrathful because of anger, or impassioned because of desire, he performs different actions to fulfill the aims of these five emotions. With these five, he becomes a victorious one. {2.2.36}</p>
<p>“At dawn, at the close of the day, at midday, or at midnight he should thoroughly do the practice with the consort (mudrā). Otherwise there will be no accomplishment. When the practitioner stays among uncouth people, and is afraid that the teachings might be disparaged, he should visualize the union with consort in his own mind only, manifesting it in his imagination. Otherwise, the practitioner should do this practice assiduously with a real consort. If a wisdom consort (prajñā) cannot be acquired in the flesh, he should practice perpetually with those in ‘the horizontal profession.’ For if the practitioner does not physically touch the best of lotuses every day, every month of the year, his samaya becomes damaged. And when the samaya is damaged, he becomes negligent of his practice. Having restored his samaya of a bodhisattva, he should vow not to let this happen again thenceforth. Consequently, he should do the practice with the consort (mudrā) in secret, using secret substances, mantra, and tantric techniques, while keeping his samaya, following his prescribed conduct, and abiding in reality (tattva). Having attained awakening in this way, having inevitably reached the inconceivable state by means of the correct practice of union, he should meditate one-pointedly on the threefold universe as the inconceivable domain.” {2.2.37}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the second chapter, called “Meditating on the Meaning of Insight and Skillful Means.”</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>“Now I will teach</p>
<p>The miraculous manifestation of all maṇḍalas—</p>
<p>The maṇḍala of glorious Vajrasattva and other deities,</p>
<p>Which is complete and perfect in every way. {2.3.1}</p>
<p>“Within the pleasure of the supreme secret,</p>
<p>One should practice the nature of them all.</p>
<p>In a secluded place, a residence,</p>
<p>Or one’s own garden {2.3.2}</p>
<p>“One should perform each of the seals thoroughly,</p>
<p>And together with each of the Saṃvaras, in all their detail,</p>
<p>Complete all the other features necessary in a maṇḍala,</p>
<p>At one’s leisure. {2.3.3}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala of all the tathāgatas</p>
<p>Is the gnosis of emptiness itself;</p>
<p>It accomplishes all the practices</p>
<p>Of wrathful and peaceful deities. {2.3.4}</p>
<p>“How shall I explain the inconceivable</p>
<p>Dance of the buddhas,</p>
<p>The meditation of deity practice,</p>
<p>The ritual procedure of mantra recitation, {2.3.5}</p>
<p>“Or the images painted or sculpted,</p>
<p>Or any images mentally created?</p>
<p>All this has been taught by me in the tantras</p>
<p>For the benefit and advantage of beings. {2.3.6}</p>
<p>“While the holder of the vajra of emptiness (Vajradhara) is only one,</p>
<p>The family of the tathāgatas is said to be fivefold.” {2.3.7}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“Please be so kind to explain,</p>
<p>O gentle lord of great bliss,</p>
<p>The nature of the letters and colors visualized in the development stage,</p>
<p>And the order and arrangement of the deities’ arms. {2.3.8}</p>
<p>“Please explain also the rules regarding the mantra recitation,</p>
<p>By means of which the practitioner will become accomplished.” {2.3.9}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Firstly, one should cultivate loving kindness;</p>
<p>Secondly, compassion;</p>
<p>Thirdly, sympathetic joy;</p>
<p>And lastly, equanimity. {2.3.10}</p>
<p>“Enumerating again, one should first awaken in emptiness;</p>
<p>Secondly, one should conceive the seed syllable;</p>
<p>Thirdly, one should generate the complete image of the deity;</p>
<p>And fourthly, one should do the placement of syllables. {2.3.11}</p>
<p>“One should visualize in front a sun disk transformed from the syllable ra,</p>
<p>And on it a double vajra scepter transformed from the syllable hūṁ.</p>
<p>One should visualize a surrounding wall and a protective canopy</p>
<p>As made of such double scepters. {2.3.12}</p>
<p>“Then the wise practitioner should first visualize a corpse,</p>
<p>Which has the nature of the expanse of phenomena.</p>
<p>Then, standing on top of it,</p>
<p>He should conceive of himself as Heruka. {2.3.13}</p>
<p>“In his heart he should visualize the syllable ra,</p>
<p>And arising from it, a sun disk.</p>
<p>On that sun disk he should visualize the syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>With the nature of wisdom and skillful means, {2.3.14}</p>
<p>“Black in color and very frightening.</p>
<p>The hūṁ then transforms into a vajra scepter.</p>
<p>In the center of the scepter’s hub,</p>
<p>He should once again visualize the very quintessence of hūṁ. {2.3.15}</p>
<p>“He should visualize that this transforms</p>
<p>Into the lord whose nature is hatred—</p>
<p>The great hero of adamantine origin,</p>
<p>Whose color resembles that of a blue lotus. {2.3.16}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should visualize him,</p>
<p>With strong faith, as reddish-blue,</p>
<p>Picturing him, the venerable one, in the sky above</p>
<p>As being of adamantine origin and filled with great compassion. {2.3.17}</p>
<p>“He should worship him by means of visualizing</p>
<p>The eight goddesses of offerings, adorned with all kinds of jewelry:</p>
<p>Gaurī who is holding a moon disk,</p>
<p>Caurī holding a sun disk, {2.3.18}</p>
<p>“Vetalī with a water vessel in her hand,</p>
<p>Ghasmarī holding medicines,</p>
<p>Pukkasī with a vajra scepter in her hand,</p>
<p>Śavarī holding tasty foodstuffs, {2.3.19}</p>
<p>“Caṇḍālī sounding a ḍamaru,</p>
<p>And Ḍombī embracing him around the neck.</p>
<p>The lord should be worshiped by these goddesses</p>
<p>According to the elaborate ritual procedure for offering. {2.3.20}</p>
<p>“Then he should become the nature of all phenomena,</p>
<p>Which is free from any reference.</p>
<p>He should visualize the seed syllable between the moon and sun disks,</p>
<p>Which emerge from the vowels and the consonants respectively. {2.3.21}</p>
<p>“That cognition is precisely what is called the being</p>
<p>Whose nature is the supreme joy.</p>
<p>Forms of light identical to his own body emanate forth,</p>
<p>Flooding the expanse of the sky. {2.3.22}</p>
<p>“Once the practitioner has absorbed them, drawing them back into his heart,</p>
<p>He should become Heruka—one whose nature is hatred. {2.3.23}</p>
<p>“In the center of the expanse of the sky</p>
<p>He should visualize a sun disk.</p>
<p>Then from the syllable hūṁ atop the sun disk he arises,</p>
<p>Reddish-blue in color, and adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {2.3.24}</p>
<p>“He has two arms, one face,</p>
<p>Three eyes, and yellow, upward-flowing hair.</p>
<p>With an angry gaze, and the body of a sixteen year old,</p>
<p>He stands astride Bhairava. {2.3.25}</p>
<p>“With a vajra khaṭvāṅga in his left arm,</p>
<p>A skull cup in his left hand,</p>
<p>And a black vajra scepter in his right hand,</p>
<p>Whose nature is to make the sound hūṁ, {2.3.26}</p>
<p>“The lord frolics in a charnel ground,</p>
<p>Surrounded by the eight goddesses.</p>
<p>The practitioner should visualize in this way</p>
<p>The lord who is the supreme ambrosia of all practices. {2.3.27}</p>
<p>“He alone is the blessed practice of the union—</p>
<p>The tathāgata Vajrasattva. {2.3.28}</p>
<p>“He should then assume the form of the angry Heruka</p>
<p>Adorned with four arms,</p>
<p>Meaning that he is the nature of the four joys</p>
<p>And is purified of the four Māras. {2.3.29}</p>
<p>“Standing in the previously described maṇḍala circle,</p>
<p>He has transformed from the seed syllable hūṁ.</p>

<p>“He should visualize her form</p>
<p>As the Blessed Vajravārāhī. {2.3.32}</p>
<p>“First, he should meditate on emptiness.</p>
<p>Then, on the pericarp of a lotus</p>
<p>He should visualize a full moon disk,</p>

<p>Himself in the center of a bhaga. {2.3.38}</p>
<p>“Then he should visualize the consort (mudrā)</p>
<p>As united with the main deity.</p>
<p>On the lotus petals, he should draw the goddesses</p>
<p>Standing on skull cup platforms. {2.3.39}</p>
<p>“Their forms, of different colors, are pleasing to the mind</p>

<p>Second, he should draw the goddess who has in her hands a spear,</p>
<p>A skull cup filled with blood, {2.3.41}</p>
<p>“A vajra scepter, and a noose.</p>
<p>He should draw her on the southern petal.</p>

<p>And the lord Mahāsukha on the pericarp. {2.3.49}</p>
<p>“He should draw, in the secret maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Various musical instruments.</p>

<p>A goddess holding a goad, {2.3.50}</p>
<p>“And likewise, one with a vajra noose, a chain,</p>
<p>And a vajra bell.</p>
<p>He should visualize himself in the center of a vulva,</p>
<p>And later begin mantra recitation. {2.3.51}</p>
<p>“Hūṁ pertains to Vajrasattva;</p>
<p>Oṁ is distinctiveness of tone;</p>
<p>Aḥ, which is of the color of pure crystal,</p>
<p>Is perfectly endowed with speech. {2.3.52}</p>
<p>“He should add the syllable hrīḥ</p>
<p>And also the word svāhā.</p>
<p>This mantra has been taught as the one to recite,</p>
<p>But, during meditation, it should consist of a single syllable. {2.3.53}</p>
<p>“The syllable hrīḥ of the goddesses</p>
<p>Should then be placed on the petals.</p>
<p>It should be joined with the four seed syllables</p>
<p>That are the nature of the four types of offerings. {2.3.54}</p>
<p>“It should be joined with the first sound (oṁ), and so forth,</p>
<p>And placed on the female gatekeepers all around.</p>

<p>His vajra into the bhaga. {2.3.55}</p>
<p>“He should, at that point, utter the syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>And also the syllable hrīḥ.</p>
<p>He should orally ingest the semen,</p>
<p>Mixing it with the blood, when the woman is menstruating. {2.3.56}</p>
<p>“He should make offerings of flowers and fragrances</p>
<p>To himself and also to the bhaga.</p>
<p>At this point he should recite the mantra</p>
<p>If he wants to attain siddhi. {2.3.57}</p>
<p>“There is Vajraraudrī</p>
<p>And also Vajrabimbā.</p>
<p>Vajrarāgī is the third</p>
<p>And Vajrasaumyā the fourth. {2.3.58}</p>
<p>“The fifth is Vajrayakṣī</p>
<p>And the sixth Vajraḍākinī.</p>

<p>And Pṛthvīvajrā is the eighth.” {2.3.59}</p>
<p>Here concludes the third part of the second chapter.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“Listen well, Vajragarbha, about the preparation</p>
<p>Of magical circles and their specifications, as required for</p>
<p>Pacifying, enriching, enthralling, and so forth,</p>
<p>And also protecting and assaulting. {2.4.1}</p>
<p>“The wise practitioner should have someone</p>
<p>Draw the outline of a wheel, with nine divisions and the rest,</p>
<p>And visualize the colors, and so forth,</p>
<p>As required for individual rituals involving the circle. {2.4.2}</p>
<p>“Oṁ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā. {2.4.3}</p>
<p>“The seed syllables of this mantra are all-purpose—</p>
<p>The first (oṁ) and the last (svāhā) are for homage and homa respectively.</p>
<p>The target’s name should be included in the middle,</p>
<p>Along with the phrase “please protect.” {2.4.4}</p>
<p>“He should fashion his form</p>
<p>From emptiness, by means of the wisdom of equality,</p>
<p>And position it within the protective circle,</p>
<p>The place of knowing everything as equal. {2.4.5}</p>
<p>“He should meditate that protection is provided</p>
<p>By wisdom beings, so that all dangers are kept at a distance.</p>
<p>Accepting the non-reality of sentient beings,</p>
<p>He should cultivate the state of deity yoga. {2.4.6}</p>
<p>“In the center of a moon disk</p>
<p>He should visualize a lotus throne</p>
<p>And imagine there his own body</p>
<p>As the goddess Tārā, who grants all siddhis. {2.4.7}</p>
<p>“He should visualize the following letters:</p>
<p>“On his head, oṁ tāre svāhā.</p>
<p>On the eyes, oṁ tuttāre svāhā.</p>
<p>On the nose, oṁ ture svāhā.</p>
<p>On the ears, oṁ tu svāhā.</p>
<p>On the tongue, oṁ re svāhā.</p>
<p>On the chest, oṁ tāriṇi svāhā. {2.4.8}</p>
<p>“He should always wear this sixfold protection</p>
<p>And visualize himself as noble Tārā,</p>
<p>With two arms, sitting in the sattvaparyaṅka posture,</p>
<p>And adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {2.4.9}</p>
<p>“Her right hand grants fearlessness to all;</p>
<p>Her left one holds a lotus.</p>
<p>Among all the deities, he should propitiate</p>
<p>The one who is roused by the following king of mantras: {2.4.10}</p>
<p>“Oṁ kurukulle hrīḥ svāhā.</p>
<p>“This mantra accomplishes everything. {2.4.11}</p>
<p>“It protects from being bound by enemies and kings,</p>
<p>From poisons dreadful in their ways.</p>
<p>It arrests various fevers afflicting the body</p>
<p>And removes untimely death due to toxins and so forth. {2.4.12}</p>
<p>“Wherever there is fear,</p>
<p>He should employ this mantra.</p>
<p>A dull-witted person will become intelligent.</p>
<p>He should write it down and wear it for protection. {2.4.13}</p>
<p>“This sublime protection</p>
<p>Vanquishes every threat.</p>
<p>It protects everyone;</p>
<p>It is the unsurpassable essence of deity yoga. {2.4.14}</p>
<p>“He should visualize a sun disk</p>
<p>With blazing light rays,</p>
<p>And at its center the syllable hrīḥ,</p>
<p>Shining with red light. {2.4.15}</p>
<p>“Then, he should visualize himself</p>
<p>In Kurukullā’s form, with one face and four arms,</p>
<p>Holding in one pair of her hands an arrow and a bow,</p>
<p>And in the other pair, a lotus and a goad. {2.4.16}</p>
<p>“By merely meditating on this</p>
<p>One can enthrall the threefold universe—</p>
<p>Kings with one hundred thousand repetitions of the mantra;</p>
<p>Ordinary people with ten thousand; {2.4.17}</p>
<p>“Animals, yakṣas, and so forth with ten million repetitions;</p>
<p>Demigods with seven hundred thousand;</p>
<p>Gods with two hundred thousand;</p>
<p>And followers of Mantra with one hundred. {2.4.18}</p>
<p>“This yantra-wheel has eight spokes,</p>
<p>Is white, and has a beautiful glow.</p>
<p>Visualizing it as having the nature of equality,</p>
<p>And being in essence the threefold universe, {2.4.19}</p>
<p>“He should form himself as previously explained</p>
<p>With the aforementioned characteristics,</p>
<p>And then visualize [Prajñāpāramitā’s] yantra-wheel</p>
<p>In the rituals for making wisdom blaze forth. {2.4.20}</p>
<p>“He should recite, Oṁ prajñe mahāprajñe hūṁ svāhā. {2.4.21}</p>
<p>“He should visualize himself by means of merging with the essence</p>
<p>As Prajñāpāramitā, the very nature of wisdom made manifest,</p>
<p>Sitting in the center of a moon disk,</p>
<p>And blazing with a profusion of light. {2.4.22}</p>
<p>“She has two arms and sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture.</p>
<p>Adorned with all kinds of jewelry,</p>
<p>Sublime with white radiance,</p>
<p>She should be construed as the very nature of wisdom. {2.4.23}</p>
<p>“When this mantra is recited</p>
<p>By those who are dull, or of inferior intellect,</p>
<p>Their wisdom will grow like the branch of a tree</p>
<p>Through their applying this method for increasing it. {2.4.24}</p>
<p>“In the center of a moon disk</p>
<p>He should place the seed syllable of Vairocana.</p>
<p>This syllable changes into the lord with one face and four arms,</p>
<p>Sitting in the center of a throne of human skulls. {2.4.25}</p>
<p>“Of gentle disposition, he holds a wheel, a bell,</p>
<p>A human skull, and a noose.</p>
<p>He radiates bursts of light all around</p>
<p>And is surrounded by a halo of flames. {2.4.26}</p>
<p>“Following the same procedure,</p>
<p>He should visualize Ratnasambhava—</p>
<p>Radiant yellow,</p>
<p>Resembling molten gold, {2.4.27}</p>
<p>“Sitting in the center of a throne of human skulls,</p>
<p>With one face and four arms,</p>
<p>Of heroic disposition, and holding a jewel, a goad,</p>
<p>A human skull, and a noose. {2.4.28}</p>
<p>“Following the same procedure, he should visualize</p>
<p>The vajra holder of the lotus family (Amitābha),</p>
<p>With one face and four arms,</p>
<p>Shining like ruby, {2.4.29}</p>
<p>“Holding a bow and arrow, of heroic disposition,</p>
<p>Sitting on a throne of human skulls.</p>
<p>Holding in his other pair of hands a lotus and a noose,</p>
<p>He is adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {2.4.30}</p>
<p>“Following the same procedure, he should visualize</p>
<p>Amoghasiddhi, a sword in his hand,</p>
<p>Sitting in the center of a throne of human skulls,</p>
<p>With one face and four arms, {2.4.31}</p>
<p>“Holding a human skull and a vajra bell,</p>
<p>And brandishing a goad in one of his right hands.</p>
<p>He is the color of green beryl</p>
<p>And adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {2.4.32}</p>
<p>“In the middle of the expanse of the sky,</p>
<p>He should visualize a moon disk.</p>
<p>At its center, is the seed syllable bhrūṁ</p>
<p>Which changes into the form of Locanā. {2.4.33}</p>
<p>“Sitting on a throne of human skulls,</p>
<p>She is adorned with eight arms</p>
<p>And holds in her hands a wheel,</p>
<p>A bow and arrow, a vajra scepter, a bell, {2.4.34}</p>
<p>“A noose, a sword, and a human skull.</p>
<p>She has one face and three eyes,</p>
<p>And is fully adorned with all kinds of jewelry,</p>
<p>Necklaces, and anklets. {2.4.35}</p>
<p>“She is white and very beautiful,</p>
<p>And she is wearing a crown of human skulls.</p>
<p>Next he should visualize, in the middle</p>
<p>Of the expanse of the sky, a full moon disk. {2.4.36}</p>
<p>“At its center there is the syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>Which changes into the form of Māmakī,</p>
<p>Radiant blue in color,</p>
<p>Sitting in the center of a throne of human skulls. {2.4.37}</p>
<p>“She has three eyes, one face,</p>
<p>And is adorned with a garland of human skulls.</p>

<p>A goad, a sword, {2.4.38}</p>
<p>“A noose, a scepter,</p>
<p>A bell, a human skull,</p>
<p>A wheel, a jewel, a lotus, and a khaṭvāṅga—</p>
<p>Twelve articles for her twelve hands. {2.4.39}</p>
<p>“Next he should draw a secret maṇḍala</p>
<p>Adorned with all embellishments.</p>
<p>In the center of the bhaga,</p>
<p>He should visualize a full moon disk. {2.4.40}</p>
<p>“There he should visualize the syllable hrīḥ,</p>
<p>And generate from it the goddess called Pāṇḍarā.</p>
<p>She is sitting on a throne of human skulls</p>
<p>And blazes forth bright red light. {2.4.41}</p>
<p>“Replete with all adornments,</p>
<p>She is adorned with eight hands,</p>
<p>In which she is holding a bow,</p>
<p>An arrow, a lotus, a sword, {2.4.42}</p>
<p>“A skull cup, a vajra scepter, a bell,</p>

<p>She is adorned with all kinds of jewelry,</p>
<p>And makes a jingling sound with her necklaces and anklets. {2.4.43}</p>
<p>“If the practitioner visualizes her as such,</p>
<p>He will swiftly attain the state of awakening.</p>
<p>Next he should visualize, in the sky above,</p>
<p>The disk of a full moon. {2.4.44}</p>
<p>“At its center there is the syllable tāṁ,</p>
<p>Which changes into the form of Tārā,</p>
<p>Adorned with eight arms,</p>
<p>Sitting on a throne of human skulls. {2.4.45}</p>
<p>“Impassioned, she holds in her hands a sword,</p>

<p>And adorned with all kinds of jewelry. {2.4.47}</p>
<p>“If the practitioner meditates in this way,</p>
<p>He will become equal to Vajrasattva.” {2.4.48}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign second chapter of the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa,” so called to reflect the secret foundation of all tantras.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>“Listen about the practice, as it really is,</p>
<p>Of generating Nairātmyā and Heruka,</p>
<p>One through which all wicked</p>
<p>And violent beings will be tamed. {3.1.1}</p>
<p>“The transformations effected by the ḍāka and ḍākinīs—</p>
<p>All of them I will explain to you.</p>
<p>The vajra-holding Heruka, in his identity of Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>Will bring on the vajra-like state. {3.1.2}</p>
<p>“One should assume a wild form in a raging ring of flames;</p>
<p>It should be radiating all around.</p>
<p>One should next visualize a garland of seed syllables</p>
<p>In the center of a moon disk. {3.1.3}</p>
<p>“Then the vajra-holding Heruka, out of great passion,</p>
<p>Melts down along with his consort (vidyā).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the vidyās of the retinue exhort him,</p>
<p>By offering various songs, to rise again. {3.1.4}</p>
<p>“Pukkasī:</p>
<p>“ ‘Arise, O lord! You are the essence of compassion!</p>
<p>Please save me, Pukkasī.</p>
<p>Abandon your void nature!</p>
<p>Take me in union, O Great Bliss!’ {3.1.5}</p>
<p>“Śavarī:</p>
<p>“ ‘Without you I would die.</p>
<p>Arise, Hevajra!</p>
<p>Abandon the state of the empty nature!</p>
<p>Fulfill the desires of Śavarī!’ {3.1.6}</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī:</p>
<p>“ ‘Invite the world, O lord of pleasure!</p>
<p>Why do you remain in the void?</p>
<p>I, Caṇḍālī, beseech you.</p>
<p>Without you I have no direction.’ {3.1.7}</p>
<p>Ḍombī:</p>
<p>“ ‘Arise, O magician!</p>
<p>May I know your mind!</p>
<p>Since I, Ḍombī, am swooning,</p>
<p>Do not interrupt your compassion!’ {3.1.8}</p>
<p>“The great Heruka arises then, in a fluid form,</p>
<p>From the syllables aṁ and hūṁ,</p>
<p>Spreading his feet on the ground</p>
<p>And threatening the gods and demigods. {3.1.9}</p>
<p>“From the syllables of the lord’s pleasure consort {dga’ ma}—</p>
<p>Hūṁ and aṁ —in a frightful blaze of blue,</p>
<p>One should generate the goddesses of the retinue</p>
<p>From their seed syllables gaṁ, caṁ, vaṁ, ghaṁ, puṁ,śaṁ, laṁ, and ḍaṁ. {3.1.10}</p>
<p>“In this circle of mothers, the blissful abode,</p>
<p>One should visualize the lord as follows:</p>
<p>He has eight faces, four legs,</p>
<p>And is adorned with sixteen arms. {3.1.11}</p>
<p>“Standing astride the four Māras,</p>
<p>And frightening even fear itself,</p>
<p>He expresses the moods of sensuality, heroism,</p>
<p>Disgust, fury, mirth, terror, {3.1.12}</p>
<p>“Compassion, wonder, and peace—</p>
<p>The nine moods of dramaturgy.</p>
<p>Wearing a skull-garland necklace,</p>
<p>He stands on a sun disk and performs his wild tāṇḍava dance. {3.1.13}</p>
<p>“Black and frightening,</p>
<p>He has a double vajra scepter fastened to the crown of his head.</p>
<p>He emits the syllable hūṁ from his mouth</p>
<p>And his body is smeared with ashes. {3.1.14}</p>
<p>“Joined with Nairātmyā,</p>
<p>He is engaged in pleasurable union.</p>
<p>Motionless, he is attaining bliss;</p>
<p>Motionless, he dwells in his own nature. {3.1.15}</p>
<p>“His main face is black and smiling.</p>
<p>His right one is the color of a jasmine blossom.</p>
<p>His left face is red and very frightening,</p>
<p>And his top face is terrifying with its bared fangs. {3.1.16}</p>
<p>“He has twenty-four eyes altogether,</p>
<p>And his remaining faces are the color of bees.</p>
<p>In his right hands he holds a vajra scepter, a sword,</p>
<p>An arrow, a wheel, {3.1.17}</p>
<p>“A goblet, a staff,</p>
<p>A trident, and a goad.</p>
<p>In his left hands he has a bell and a lotus,</p>

<p>“He also holds a skull cup, a jewel,</p>
<p>And a noose, and displays a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>He is surrounded by clouds of buddhas,</p>
<p>Radiating different colored lights all around. {3.1.19}</p>
<p>“In this way, one should then follow the routine</p>
<p>Of visualizing Gaurī, and so forth.</p>
<p>“Gaurī is white in color and is engaged</p>
<p>In the act of drawing a bow and arrow.</p>
<p>Her other implements are a skull cup full of blood</p>
<p>And a knife with a vajra handle. {3.1.20}</p>
<p>“Caurī is red in color,</p>
<p>And is known to hold a wheel, a goad,</p>
<p>A skull cup, and a ḍamaru drum.</p>
<p>One should visualize her as divinely beautiful. {3.1.21}</p>
<p>“Pramohā is black in color.</p>
<p>She holds a skull cup, a goblet,</p>
<p>A ploughshare for turning up the earth,</p>
<p>And in her right hand she brandishes a trident. {3.1.22}</p>
<p>“Vetalī is light yellow in color,</p>
<p>With wine and water in two of her hands,</p>
<p>And a sword and a skull cup in her other hands.</p>

<p>“Pukkasī is yellow in color.</p>
<p>She holds a tendril of the wish-fulfilling tree,</p>
<p>A skull bowl filled with meat, and a jewel.</p>
<p>She displays a boon-granting mudrā. {3.1.24}</p>
<p>“Caṇḍālī is blue in color</p>
<p>And holds a wind-cloth.</p>
<p>In her other two hands she holds</p>

<p>“Ghasmarī is yellowish green in color.</p>
<p>She holds a vajra-fire pit and an axe in two of her hands,</p>

<p>“Śavarī is white in color,</p>
<p>With a khaṭvāṅga, a skull cup,</p>
<p>A vajra scepter, and a noose.</p>
<p>One should visualize [these goddesses’] forms in all their diversity. {3.1.27}</p>
<p>“They each have a creature: Gaurī, a rohita fish;</p>
<p>Caurī, a wild boar; Pramohā, a tortoise; Vetalī, a snake;</p>
<p>Pukkasī, a lion; Caṇḍālī, a tiger;</p>
<p>Ghasmarī, a jackal; and Śavarī, a bear. {3.1.28}</p>
<p>“They are in the eight skull cups, respectively,</p>
<p>Of Gaurī, and so forth, in the right order.</p>
<p>These goddesses are adorned with all kinds of jewelry</p>
<p>And express the moods of sensuality, and so forth. {3.1.29}</p>
<p>“There are also the following goddesses:</p>
<p>The horse-faced, the pig-faced, the dog-faced, and the lion-faced.</p>
<p>All have four arms and four faces,</p>
<p>And are adorned with serpent jewelry. {3.1.30}</p>
<p>“Also present are Vaṃśā, the flute goddess, Vīṇā, the lute goddess,</p>
<p>Mukundā, the kettle-drum goddess, and Murajā, the tambourine goddess.</p>
<p>They each have two arms, one face,</p>
<p>And are adorned with all types of jewelry. {3.1.31}</p>
<p>“The faces—main, right, left—of the horse-faced goddess</p>
<p>Are, respectively, black, white, and yellow, with the upper face being green.</p>
<p>Those of the pig-faced goddess are—in the same order—</p>
<p>Yellow, black, and white, with the upper face being red. {3.1.32}</p>
<p>“The faces of the dog-faced goddess</p>
<p>Are red, black, and white, with the upper face being yellow.</p>
<p>Those of the lion-faced goddess</p>
<p>Are green, black, and white, with the upper face being the color of flames. {3.1.33}</p>
<p>“Each of the goddesses has blazing, upward-flowing hair</p>
<p>And stands astride a corpse, her left leg extended and her right slightly bent.</p>
<p>They all have three eyes and are to be visualized</p>
<p>With faces expressing the moods of anger, sensuality, and mirth.” {3.1.34}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the third chapter, on generating Heruka.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajragarbha, O powerful king,</p>
<p>About the practice of Jñānaḍākinī,</p>
<p>Which is for those who abandon dualistic notions</p>
<p>And gain the wisdom of phenomena as nondual. {3.2.1}</p>
<p>“One should recite the following formula of purification</p>
<p>At the beginning of every practice three times:</p>
<p>“All phenomena are pure by nature;</p>
<p>I am pure by nature.</p>
<p>All phenomena have the pure nature of vajra;</p>
<p>I have the pure nature of vajra.</p>
<p>All phenomena have the pure nature of the union;</p>
<p>I have the pure nature of the union. {3.2.2}</p>
<p>“Having thus recited, the practitioner</p>
<p>Should meditate on the same.</p>
<p>He should then commence the meditation proper</p>
<p>In a place pleasing to the mind. {3.2.3}</p>
<p>“He should spread out a canopy,</p>
<p>Hang fabrics of various colors from it,</p>
<p>And hoist up streamers and banners.</p>
<p>All around, throughout the ten directions, {3.2.4}</p>
<p>“He should strew various perfumes and flowers,</p>
<p>And then form a maṇḍala of scented powders.</p>
<p>There, through an instantaneous transformation,</p>
<p>He should visualize his own form as the deity. {3.2.5}</p>
<p>“Thus visualizing himself as Jñānaḍākinī,</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should first worship her with offerings.</p>
<p>He should accordingly generate,</p>
<p>According to proper procedure, an ocean of wisdom. {3.2.6}</p>
<p>“He should then visualize Mount Meru,</p>
<p>With the four directions surrounding its peak having four different colors.</p>
<p>Atop the peak is a golden palace,</p>
<p>Bright and colorful with the seven types of jewels. {3.2.7}</p>
<p>“Around it are garlands of wind chime bells,</p>
<p>Spread all around as desired.</p>
<p>He should also visualize a lion throne</p>
<p>In each of the five places. {3.2.8}</p>
<p>“Then, visualizing a sun disk</p>
<p>Adorned with a white parasol,</p>
<p>He should, with the exhalation of his breath,</p>
<p>Project Jñānaḍākinī into its center. {3.2.9}</p>
<p>“She has three faces and six arms,</p>
<p>And sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture.</p>
<p>She is adorned with loose, disheveled hair</p>
<p>And the five buddhas atop her head. {3.2.10}</p>
<p>“Blue in color, and with a terrifying form,</p>
<p>She is bedecked with adornments made of snakes.</p>
<p>Expressing the moods of mirth, anger, and sensuality,</p>
<p>She has three eyes, and is divinely beautiful. {3.2.11}</p>
<p>“She is laughing loudly, baring her fangs,</p>
<p>And beautiful in her red apparel.</p>
<p>She holds up a khaṭvāṅga,</p>
<p>And in her second hand, an axe. {3.2.12}</p>
<p>“In her third hand she has a vajra scepter.</p>
<p>In her first left hand, she has a bell;</p>
<p>In her second left hand, an alms bowl;</p>
<p>And in her third, she holds a sword. {3.2.13}</p>
<p>“The wise practitioner should visualize her in the middle,</p>
<p>Radiating manifold rays of light.</p>
<p>To the east of Jñānaḍākinī, he should project,</p>
<p>With his outgoing breath, Vajraḍākinī. {3.2.14}</p>
<p>“She is white and exquisite,</p>
<p>Adorned with loose, disheveled hair,</p>
<p>Bedecked with adornments made of snakes,</p>
<p>And expressing the mood of sensuality. {3.2.15}</p>
<p>“She is bedecked with exquisite garments</p>
<p>And adorned with two arms.</p>
<p>He should visualize Vajraḍākinī</p>
<p>Carrying a khaṭvāṅga and a yogic alms bowl. {3.2.16}</p>
<p>“To the north of Jñānaḍākinī, projected with his outgoing breath,</p>
<p>He should visualize Ghoraḍākinī,</p>
<p>With two arms, sitting in the sattvaparyaṅka posture,</p>
<p>Resplendent with the color of molten gold. {3.2.17}</p>
<p>“She carries a khaṭvāṅga and a yogic alms bowl,</p>
<p>Is adorned with loose, disheveled hair,</p>
<p>And her limbs are adorned with ornaments made of snakes.</p>
<p>Her figure is bedecked with exquisite garments.</p>
<p>“Thus should he visualize</p>
<p>The goddess called Ghoraḍākinī. {3.2.18}</p>
<p>“To the west of Jñānaḍākinī</p>
<p>He should project Vetalī.</p>
<p>Again, she has two arms and sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture.</p>
<p>She is blue in color and exquisite. {3.2.19}</p>
<p>“She holds a khaṭvāṅga and a yogic bowl,</p>
<p>And is adorned with loose, disheveled hair.</p>
<p>Snakes form her body ornaments,</p>
<p>And exquisite clothes embellish her figure. {3.2.20}</p>
<p>“To the south of Jñānaḍākinī</p>
<p>He should project the red Caṇḍālī,</p>
<p>Who holds a khaṭvāṅga and a yogic bowl,</p>
<p>And is adorned with loose, disheveled hair. {3.2.21}</p>
<p>“She has two arms, one face,</p>
<p>And is adorned with different ornaments.</p>
<p>The practitioner should thus visualize this pentad of goddesses,</p>
<p>Himself endowed with perfect beauty and form. {3.2.22}</p>
<p>“In the northeast he should visualize</p>
<p>The goddess Siṃhinī with the face of a lion.</p>
<p>She is white and yellow, and stands with her right leg outstretched</p>
<p>And the left slightly bent, on a pedestal fashioned from the lord of nāgas. {3.2.23}</p>
<p>“She holds a vajra goad and, in her other hand, a noose in a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>She is nicely attired in exquisite garments.</p>
<p>He should visualize her body radiating</p>
<p>With a manifold blaze of light rays. {3.2.24}</p>
<p>“In the southeast there is the goddess called Vyāghrī</p>
<p>On a supreme throne made of seven types of jewels.</p>
<p>She has two arms, is blue and white in color,</p>
<p>And is beautifully attired and adorned with jewelry. {3.2.25}</p>
<p>“She holds a blazing vajra goad and a noose,</p>
<p>While forming a threatening gesture with her fingers.</p>
<p>He should visualize her body radiant</p>
<p>With a manifold blaze of light rays. {3.2.26}</p>
<p>“In the southwest there is the goddess Jambukī,</p>
<p>Laughing loudly and inspiring fear.</p>
<p>She is mounted on a buffalo.</p>
<p>Her body is red and black in color. {3.2.27}</p>
<p>“Her body is attired with exquisite garments</p>
<p>And she has two arms.</p>
<p>Her implements are a noose held with a threatening gesture and a goad.</p>
<p>She is adorned with ornaments made of snakes. {3.2.28}</p>
<p>“In the northwest there is the goddess Ulūkā,</p>
<p>Yellow and red in color.</p>
<p>She sits on a snake throne</p>
<p>And snakes, too, should be visualized as her ornaments. {3.2.29}</p>
<p>“She has two arms and sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture.</p>
<p>Her implements are a goad and a noose held with a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>One should visualize her body radiant</p>
<p>With a manifold blaze of light rays. {3.2.30}</p>
<p>“There are eight ḍākinīs in the center</p>
<p>And four on the outside.</p>
<p>Having visualized in this way the order of their distribution,</p>
<p>He should subsequently assign each one a place. {3.2.31}</p>
<p>“The royal goddess in the east, Ḍākinī,</p>
<p>Has two arms and is white in color.</p>
<p>She sits on a corpse</p>
<p>And is adorned with snakes as ornaments. {3.2.32}</p>
<p>“She is wild, with disheveled hair,</p>
<p>And her splendor is like that of a blazing fire.</p>
<p>Radiant, she raises her hands</p>
<p>To her mouth, laughing loudly. {3.2.33}</p>
<p>“In the north there is the royal goddess Dīpinī,</p>
<p>Wild, and yellow in color.</p>
<p>Frightening in form and baring her teeth,</p>
<p>She is attired in exquisite garments. {3.2.34}</p>
<p>“She sits on a corpse;</p>
<p>Her splendor is like that of a blazing fire.</p>
<p>Her two hands are folded together at her forehead,</p>
<p>Resembling the flame of a lamp. {3.2.35}</p>
<p>“In the west there is the goddess Cūṣiṇī,</p>
<p>Red in color and inspiring fear.</p>
<p>She sits on a corpse,</p>
<p>Attired in exquisite garments. {3.2.36}</p>
<p>“From her cupped hands she drinks blood,</p>
<p>Trickling in the form of a red thread.</p>
<p>Fierce and with the splendor of a blazing fire,</p>
<p>Cūṣiṇī is indeed a powerful deity. {3.2.37}</p>
<p>“In the south there is the goddess called Kambojī,</p>
<p>Shiny black in color.</p>
<p>She sits on a corpse,</p>
<p>Adorned with disheveled hair. {3.2.38}</p>
<p>“She looks resplendent in her red clothes</p>
<p>And is adorned with ornaments of snakes.</p>
<p>In her hands she holds a javelin and displays a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>She makes everyone’s mind free from delusion. {3.2.39}</p>
<p>“The all-knowing practitioner should always visualize</p>
<p>Each of them as wild and radiating like a blazing fire.</p>
<p>In front of these forms and images,</p>
<p>The pledge substances should be displayed accordingly. {3.2.40}</p>
<p>“Taking the seventh syllable from the syllable of wind and the seventh from fire,</p>
<p>He should impel the latter seventh with the seed syllable of Vajrī.</p>
<p>This should be crowned by the anunāsika and supported by the sound ū.</p>
<p>This combination is known as the torrent of ambrosia.” {3.2.41}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the third chapter.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>“Now I will teach the practice of Nairātmyā,</p>
<p>Briefly, as has been taught.</p>
<p>In the middle of space</p>
<p>One should visualize a sun disk, {3.3.1}</p>
<p>“Then the maṇḍala with its arrangement of elements</p>
<p>In the order of the appearance of the deities.</p>
<p>Before the maṇḍala comes earth and water,</p>
<p>And then fire, in their due order. {3.3.2}</p>
<p>“Then comes the great wind, and the symbols,</p>
<p>Which correspond to the order of the appearance of the deities.</p>
<p>The maṇḍala, which arises out of the dharmodaya,</p>
<p>Has two pure and perfect overlapping areas: {3.3.3}</p>
<p>“One is formed by the circle of lotus filaments,</p>
<p>And the other is the supreme three bodies of the vajra holder.</p>
<p>One should visualize a corpse there,</p>
<p>Which is the seat for each of the fifteen goddesses. {3.3.4}</p>
<p>“Above it there is a moon disk,</p>
<p>And above the moon disk is the seed syllable;</p>
<p>Resting upon that is a sun disk.</p>
<p>From the meeting of these two disks comes great bliss. {3.3.5}</p>
<p>“The moon is then transformed into the vowels</p>
<p>And the sun into the consonants.</p>
<p>The meeting of the sun and the moon</p>
<p>Is also known to be Gaurī and the other goddesses. {3.3.6}</p>
<p>“The moon represents mirror-like wisdom,</p>
<p>And the sun, the wisdom of equality.</p>
<p>The symbols of the chosen deity along with their seed syllables</p>
<p>Are said to be discriminating wisdom. {3.3.7}</p>
<p>“The unity of all of these is action-accomplishing wisdom,</p>
<p>Which corresponds to the purity of the deity’s full form.</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should cultivate these five aspects</p>
<p>According to the sequence just described. {3.3.8}</p>
<p>“The union of the vowels and consonants</p>
<p>Constitutes the seat of Vajrasattva.</p>
<p>Since the deity embryo arises from a letter,</p>
<p>The syllables hūṁ and phaṭ are not necessary. {3.3.9}</p>
<p>“He should visualize the chief deity of the maṇḍala</p>
<p>As arising from the syllable, which is the reflection of its essence.</p>
<p>With their faces, attributes, and so forth, as before,</p>
<p>With the radiance of the moon-stone gem, {3.3.10}</p>
<p>“All the goddesses manifest in full</p>
<p>From the nature of skillful means and wisdom.</p>
<p>The vowels are wisdom and the consonants, means,</p>
<p>Reflecting the distinction between the moon and sun. {3.3.11}</p>
<p>“Since Gaurī and the others should appear one by one,</p>
<p>Following the division of the colors,</p>
<p>He should make every effort</p>
<p>To correctly execute the maṇḍala procedure. {3.3.12}</p>
<p>“The following five yoginīs are positioned</p>
<p>Within the inner enclosure;</p>
<p>The yoga adept should always conceive them to be,</p>
<p>In their natures, the five aggregates: {3.3.13}</p>
<p>“Vajrā is in the east; Gaurī is in the south;</p>
<p>Vāriyoginī is in the west;</p>
<p>Vajraḍākinī is in the north;</p>
<p>And the yoginī Nairātmyā is in the center. {3.3.14}</p>
<p>“Within the outer circle there are the following:</p>
<p>“Gaurī, Caurī, and Vetalī;</p>
<p>So too, Ghasmarī and Pukkasī.</p>
<p>Further, there are Śavarī and Caṇḍālī,</p>
<p>With Ḍombī completing the octet. {3.3.15}</p>
<p>“Down below and up above are known to be,</p>
<p>Respectively, Bhūcarī and Khecarī—</p>
<p>The first, moving, the other, stationary.</p>
<p>They have the nature of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa respectively. {3.3.16}</p>
<p>“All these goddesses can be described as follows:</p>
<p>“They are different colors, very wild,</p>
<p>And adorned with the five mudrās.</p>
<p>They have one face, four arms,</p>
<p>Three eyes, and are divinely beautiful. {3.3.17}</p>
<p>“They each wear a choker, earrings,</p>
<p>A wrist bracelet, and a waist chain.</p>
<p>They are adorned with the five buddhas,</p>
<p>Which constitute their five pure seals. {3.3.18}</p>
<p>“Each of them is said to look</p>
<p>Like the yoginī Nairātmyā,</p>
<p>Who, on her left side, holds a yogic alms bowl</p>
<p>And an upward-pointing khaṭvāṅga. {3.3.19}</p>
<p>“On her right side she holds a blue vajra scepter</p>
<p>And a flaying knife.</p>
<p>She stands on a corpse, ablaze with flames,</p>
<p>With red eyes and yellow, upward-flowing hair. {3.3.20}</p>
<p>“She is blue, brilliantly luminous,</p>
<p>And her hips are wrapped with a tiger skin.</p>
<p>She sits there in her divine beauty,</p>
<p>Glowing like the fire during the final destruction. {3.3.21}</p>
<p>“To her right there is a yellow and blue goddess, Khecarī;</p>
<p>To her left there is a red and blue one, Bhūcarī.</p>
<p>They each have two arms, a single face,</p>
<p>And are adorned with all types of jewelry. {3.3.22}</p>
<p>“They all extend forward their left hands, which hold skull cups,</p>
<p>And hold in their right hands flaying knives.</p>
<p>They express the moods of mirth, anger, and sensuality,</p>
<p>Abiding in the nature of reverence for him. {3.3.23}</p>
<p>“The wise practitioner should visualize himself in the center</p>
<p>As the identity of the natures of the three tattvas,</p>
<p>Radiating all around light of different colors,</p>
<p>Composed of scintillating clouds of buddhas.” {3.3.24}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the third chapter.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“Now I will teach</p>
<p>The supreme great maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Which has the form of the vajradhātu</p>
<p>And is known as the vajradhātu itself. {3.4.1}</p>
<p>“One should purify the maṇḍala site,</p>
<p>Making it into a place of the great seal.</p>
<p>The follower of Mantra should execute the following,</p>
<p>Watching over every detail: {3.4.2}</p>
<p>“The wise practitioner should delimit the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>To the best of his ability, using a thread</p>
<p>That is new, well woven,</p>
<p>Of the right length, and beautiful. {3.4.3}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala should have four corners and four doors,</p>
<p>And be finely adorned with porticos.</p>
<p>It should be provided with four threads</p>
<p>And adorned with fine fabrics and flower garlands {3.4.4}</p>
<p>“On all its sides,</p>
<p>Which are provided with gate-turrets,</p>
<p>He should delimit the outer maṇḍala</p>
<p>With lines of jewel-studded vajra scepters. {3.4.5}</p>
<p>“He should then enter the inner court,</p>
<p>Which has the shape of a circle;</p>
<p>It is strewn with vajra threads</p>
<p>And adorned with eight pillars. {3.4.6}</p>
<p>“It is adorned with five circles</p>
<p>Situated atop the vajra pillars.</p>
<p>Then, in the center of the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>He should place an image of the Buddha. {3.4.7}</p>
<p>“Now I will explain to you the practice</p>
<p>Connected with the maṇḍala procedure just described.</p>
<p>“Starting precisely from there, the follower of Mantra should enter this dwelling of the deity and visualize a moon disk transformed from the letter a. Above the disk, he should visualize a white, five-pointed vajra scepter, according to procedure. Having then made offerings to all the tathāgatas, and so forth, he should prostrate himself, and say the following: {3.4.8}</p>
<p>“ ‘May all buddhas and bodhisattvas please keep me in their heart! From now until I sit on the throne of liberation, I, named such and such,</p>
<p>“ ‘Give rise to the altruistic aspiration set on awakening—</p>
<p>Supreme and unsurpassable—</p>
<p>Just as the buddhas of the three times</p>
<p>Made their firm resolve to attain perfect awakening. {3.4.9}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will firmly observe each of the three kinds of bodhisattva ethics:</p>
<p>The training in ethical discipline,</p>
<p>The gathering of wholesome qualities,</p>
<p>And the ethics of acting for the benefit of beings. {3.4.10}</p>
<p>“ ‘From now onward I will firmly uphold</p>
<p>The vow, born from the union with the buddhas,</p>
<p>Of Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha,</p>
<p>The three foremost and unsurpassable jewels. {3.4.11}</p>
<p>“ ‘Within the fold of the great vajra family,</p>
<p>I will firmly uphold the vajra, bell, and hand gestures</p>
<p>According to their true nature.</p>
<p>I will commit myself to the master. {3.4.12}</p>
<p>“ ‘Within the great jewel family, as is fitting,</p>
<p>I shall bounteously give the four kinds of gifts,</p>
<p>Performing this six times each day</p>
<p>As my delightful samaya. {3.4.13}</p>
<p>“ ‘Within the great pure lotus family,</p>
<p>Which emerges from great awakening,</p>
<p>I shall uphold the true Dharma—</p>
<p>The exoteric and esoteric dimensions pertaining to the three vehicles. {3.4.14}</p>
<p>“ ‘Within the fold of the great activity family</p>
<p>I shall uphold, in every respect,</p>
<p>The all-encompassing vow</p>
<p>And perform the act of worship to the best of my ability. {3.4.15}</p>
<p>“ ‘Now that I have given rise to the altruistic aspiration set on awakening—</p>
<p>Supreme and unsurpassable—</p>
<p>And taken all the vows</p>
<p>For fulfilling the needs of all beings, {3.4.16}</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall ferry across those that have not yet crossed,</p>
<p>I shall liberate those that have not been liberated,</p>
<p>And I shall give comfort to the desolate,</p>
<p>Establishing all beings in nirvāṇa.’ ” {3.4.17}</p>
<p>Then the lord entered the meditative absorption called “that which arises from the pinnacle of all vajra holders” and gave this inspiring teaching: {3.4.18}</p>
<p>“Now, staying in a place suitable for meditation, he should observe the absence of intrinsic identity in all phenomena. Everything of an external and internal nature is imputed by mind. There is nothing else that exists beyond mind. Since all phenomena, being luminous, have never arisen in the first place, he should mentally declare them to be unproduced. Then he should perceive his own mind, which is luminous by nature, in the form of a moon disk, while reciting the following mantra with enthusiasm:</p>
<p>“ ‘Oṁ, I penetrate my mind.’ {3.4.19}</p>
<p>“This mind is like the sky—</p>
<p>Stainless despite the presence of clouds.</p>
<p>It is free from all dejection,</p>
<p>Being utterly devoid of mental constructs. {3.4.20}</p>
<p>“First it is visualized as the moon,</p>
<p>Cleansed of all the dirt of afflictions.</p>
<p>Therein enter all the qualities of the awakened ones</p>
<p>In the form of the short letter a, and so forth: {3.4.21}</p>
<p>“a ā i ī u ū ṛ ṝ ḷ ḹ e ai o au aṃ aḥ.” {3.4.22}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked:</p>
<p>“What qualities, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>Make this moon disk unique?” {3.4.23}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“It has three corners, is big in size, and is</p>
<p>A receptacle for the qualities of all awakened ones.</p>
<p>“These qualities of the awakened ones enter into it in the form of the letter a, and the rest. Possessing the luster of a crystal or the moon, they come in atop the moon disk, causing the mind, which is luminous by nature, to expand. The follower of Mantra should then generate the altruistic aspiration for awakening with the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, I give rise to bodhicitta. {3.4.24}</p>
<p>“This bodhicitta arises from having performed this rite,</p>
<p>And it begets kindness toward all beings.</p>
<p>It is replete with wholesome qualities</p>
<p>And destroys all afflictions. {3.4.25}</p>
<p>“In the center of the moon disk</p>
<p>There is a second one—the moon of awakening. {3.4.26}</p>
<p>“Here, too, the qualities of the awakened ones enter like stars in the form of the syllables ka, and so forth, by means of the qualities being reflected in the syllables. These syllables are:</p>
<p>“ka kha ga gha ṅa ca cha ja jha ña ṭa ṭha ḍa ḍha ṇa ta tha da dha na pa pha ba bha ma ya ra la va śa ṣa sa ha kṣaḥ. {3.4.27}</p>
<p>“This maṇḍala procedure has not been taught in its entirety in other tantras. Here, in addition, in order to stabilize the generation of the mind of Samantabhadra, he should visualize himself in the image of a radiant, white vajra scepter there in the middle of the aforementioned moon disk, while reciting the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ vajra! Please remain. {3.4.28}</p>
<p>“This conduct of awakening is unsurpassable.</p>
<p>Its basis, it should be well understood,</p>
<p>Is pristine, stainless wisdom without karmic stains. {3.4.29}</p>
<p>“In the center of the moon disk</p>
<p>He should visualize a vajra scepter. {3.4.30}</p>
<p>“A follower of Mantra should visualize himself with a vajra body that extends throughout the entire expanse of space. {3.4.31}</p>
<p>“Then, while practicing the radiation and absorption</p>
<p>Of tiny vajra scepters, he should recite the following mantra:</p>
<p>Oṁ, I am of the nature of vajra. {3.4.32}</p>
<p>“This vajra, which is the body of all the buddhas,</p>
<p>Has neither appearance nor abode.</p>
<p>It is unborn, unfabricated, pure,</p>
<p>And devoid of nonexistence, and so forth. {3.4.33}</p>
<p>“It is unbreakable, indivisible, and ungraspable;</p>
<p>It is the dharmakāya free of attributes;</p>
<p>It arises as the nature of vajra and is therefore</p>
<p>The unsurpassable vajra body.” {3.4.34}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked, “How do I further meditate on this vajra, O Blessed One?” {3.4.35}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “May all the tathāgatas listen! One should again visualize Vajrasattva—the reflection of the buddhas endowed with the supreme of all characteristics—while reciting the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, I am just like all the tathāgatas. {3.4.36}</p>
<p>“The buddha body, its secret nature, and the conduct,</p>
<p>The range of experience, and the awakening to reality—</p>
<p>These are the five aspects of perfect awakening,</p>
<p>The pure nature of all the buddhas.” {3.4.37}</p>
<p>Then the great bodhisattvas, led by Vajragarbha, addressed the Blessed One yet again:</p>
<p>“What, O Blessed One, are the secret vajra and lotus families?” {3.4.38}</p>
<p>The lord said:</p>
<p>“The vajra family abides in all tathāgatas;</p>
<p>The lotus family includes great goddess deities.</p>
<p>That is why the vajra scepter is positioned above the lotus flower—</p>
<p>From there issue forth all the tathāgatas. {3.4.39}</p>
<p>“In this manner, one should generate oneself as Vairocana, visualizing, above and below, the syllables of the mantra. Following the usual procedure, one should then emanate Mount Sumeru and a vast triangle, adorned with a maṇḍala of different colored lights. One should visualize, arising there, a beautiful palace, and in it, the syllable paṁ, which transforms into a multicolored lotus with a sun disk atop it. This is adorned with the syllables ya, ra, la, and va, in conjunction with the maṇḍalas of wind, fire, and so forth. Then, above that, with the appropriate mantra, one should visualize a temple palace surmounted with a vajra-jewel pinnacle, shining with various jewels and gems, and adorned with colorful streamers and banners with tiny bells attached to them, shaken by the wind. The palace is further adorned with garlands, chaplets, multi-string chains of pearls, and moon crescents. It is praised and glorified by all the tathāgatas inhabiting it. While visualizing this one should recite the mantra hūṁ. {3.4.40}</p>
<p>“Having placed this mantra, hūṁ, on a moon disk in one’s heart, one should visualize that it transforms into a five-pronged vajra scepter. One should repeatedly radiate from it five-pronged vajra scepters, and absorb them all back as buddhas. Next, one should visualize that the very same vajra scepter transforms into Vajrasattva, radiant like the color of the moon, and endowed with the supreme of all characteristics. {3.4.41}</p>
<p>“Sitting on a moon disk,</p>
<p>And adorned with all kinds of adornments,</p>
<p>The hero, handsome in his singular wisdom and joy,</p>
<p>Is holding a vajra scepter, a bell, {3.4.42}</p>
<p>“A sword, a goad,</p>
<p>A skull cup, and a noose.</p>
<p>The face on the right is black,</p>
<p>And the one on the left, red. {3.4.43}</p>
<p>“He has three faces and six arms</p>
<p>And is divinely beautiful, with three eyes on each of his faces.</p>
<p>One should visualize him in a maṇḍala of pleasure,</p>
<p>Nestled in the lotus of his consort (vidyā). {3.4.44}</p>
<p>“One should imagine that he is endowed with all the supreme</p>
<p>Characteristics consistent with his being the lord of the maṇḍala. {3.4.45}</p>
<p>“In the east there is Vairocana;</p>
<p>In the south, Ratnasambhava;</p>
<p>In the west, Amitābha;</p>
<p>And in the north, Amoghasiddhi. {3.4.46}</p>
<p>“In the northeast there is Locanā;</p>
<p>In the southeast, Māmakī;</p>
<p>In the southwest, Pāṇḍaravāsinī;</p>
<p>And in the northwest, Tārā. {3.4.47}</p>
<p>“In the outer circle,</p>
<p>“White Raudrī in the east,</p>
<p>Yellow Vajrabimbā in the south,</p>
<p>Red Rāgavajrā in the west,</p>
<p>And green Vajrasaumyā in the north. {3.4.48}</p>
<p>“In the northeast there is white and yellow Vajrayakṣī;</p>
<p>In the southeast, yellow and red Vajraḍākinī;</p>
<p>In the southwest, red and blue Śabdavajrā;</p>
<p>And in the northwest, green and white Pṛthivīvajrā. {3.4.49}</p>
<p>“In the outer circle,</p>
<p>“In the northeast, Vaṃśā;In the southeast, Vīṇā;</p>
<p>In the southwest, Mukundā;</p>
<p>And in the northwest, Murajā. {3.4.50}</p>
<p>“Vaṃśā and the other three have two arms and a single face. {3.4.51}</p>
<p>“On the outer rim there should be placed the yoginīs of the maṇḍala, each holding her respective emblem—the flower, and so forth. They likewise have two arms. {3.4.52}</p>
<p>“At the eastern gate one should draw the goddess Vajrāṃkuśī, the color of dark sky, with her right and left faces black and white respectively. In her first hand she holds a goad, in the second she brandishes a sword, and in the third she holds a discus. Her left hands hold a noose, display a threatening gesture, and hold a bell. These are the emblems in her six hands. {3.4.53}</p>
<p>“At the southern gate one should draw the white and yellow mother, Vajrapāśī, whose right and left faces are black and red respectively. In her right hands she brandishes a noose, a vajra scepter, and a sword. In her left hands she holds a discus and a bell, and holds a noose while forming a threatening gesture. These are the emblems in her six hands. {3.4.54}</p>
<p>“At the western gate one should draw Vajrasphoṭā, red in color and with great brilliance. Her right and left faces are black and white respectively. In her six hands she is holding, on the right, a fettering chain, a vajra scepter, and a sword, and on the left, a discus, a bell, and a goad. These are the emblems in her six hands. {3.4.55}</p>
<p>“At the northern gate there is the terrifying Vajraghaṇṭā. She has three faces: the middle one is green, the right one black, and the left one white. In her six hands she holds a bell, a vajra scepter, a sword, a discus, a goad, and a noose. {3.4.56}</p>
<p>“All should be visualized standing on a sun disk upon a multicolored lotus, with their blazing hair flowing upward. {3.4.57}</p>
<p>“In the intermediate directions, starting from the southeast, there are yoginīs who hold their respective emblems—the flower, and so forth. They are typically known to possess two arms. {3.4.58}</p>
<p>“At the gates starting from the east, there are yoginīs holding a goad, a noose, a fettering chain, and a bell. Thus the maṇḍala is provided with gatekeepers. {3.4.59}</p>
<p>“The syllables jaḥ, hūṁ, vaṁ, and hoḥ are taught to be their respective heart mantras; there is no doubt about this. Through being arranged, fashioned, and so forth in this manner, this is the outer maṇḍala of glorious Vajrasattva, replete with the emblems and gestures. {3.4.60}</p>
<p>“Inside the outer maṇḍala, the same design as before, is another, half its size—the maṇḍala of the wind element, in the shape of a half-moon disk, adorned with eight pillars, and surrounded on the outside with a quadruple line. {3.4.61}</p>
<p>“In all the locations assigned to the respective deities, one should arrange Gaurī and the others, along with their thrones, as described. In the center one should visualize the syllable hrīḥ; in the quarter toward the east, the syllable hrīḥ; in the south, the syllable hiḥ; in the west, the syllable gīḥ; in the north, the syllable jiḥ; in the southeast, the syllable taṁ; in the southwest, the syllable jaṁ; in the northwest, the syllable maṁ; and in the northeast, one should place the syllable haṁ. {3.4.62}</p>
<p>“In the outer circle, in the southeast, one should place the syllable oṁ; in the southwest, the syllable aṁ; in the northwest, the syllable eṁ; and in the northeast, one should place the syllable aiṁ. {3.4.63}</p>
<p>“At the eastern gate one should place the syllable jaḥ; at the southern gate, the syllable hūṁ; at the western gate, the syllable vaṁ; and at the northern gate, the syllable hoḥ. {3.4.64}</p>
<p>“Further outside one should visualize, surrounding the maṇḍala, the eight charnel grounds. One should place there the eight great spirits, Indra, and the others, who are very frightened. {3.4.65}</p>
<p>“In the east one should draw</p>
<p>A host of gods sitting upon a bodhi tree.</p>
<p>In the south one should draw</p>
<p>The powerful lord Yama atop a mango tree. {3.4.66}</p>
<p>“In the west one should place</p>
<p>The king of clouds on an aśoka tree.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the north one should situate</p>
<p>The army of yakṣas on a bodhi tree. {3.4.67}</p>
<p>“Similarly, in the southeast one should draw</p>
<p>A crowd of ṛṣis upon a pongamia tree.</p>
<p>In the southwest, on a jasmine shrub,</p>
<p>One should place rākṣasas and the like. {3.4.68}</p>
<p>“In the northwest one should draw</p>
<p>The lord of wind on a crepe jasmine bush.</p>
<p>In the northeast one should draw</p>
<p>A crowd of pretas on a banyan tree. {3.4.69}</p>
<p>“One should live covered in ashes</p>
<p>Along with Rudra, Indra, Upendra, Candra</p>
<p>Arka, and Yama, who were sealed</p>
<p>And confounded, and their treasures enjoyed. {3.4.70}</p>
<p>“Further, diligently practicing skillful means and wisdom,</p>
<p>One should carry, on one’s left side,</p>
<p>A khaṭvāṅga and a skull cup filled with blood,</p>
<p>While gently sounding a bell. {3.4.71}</p>
<p>“In one’s right hand one should carry</p>
<p>A blazing vajra scepter, which frightens even fear itself.</p>
<p>Having assumed the ardhaparyaṅka posture,</p>
<p>One should press down on one’s left thigh. {3.4.72}</p>
<p>“Stepping over Brahmā, and so forth,</p>
<p>One should enjoy this act in a manly manner.</p>
<p>He will give … {3.4.73}</p>
<p>“If the practitioner meditates</p>
<p>Visualizing multicolored light all around</p>
<p>That takes the form of scintillating clouds of buddhas,</p>
<p>He will swiftly gain accomplishment.” {3.4.74}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign third chapter of the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa.”</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>[Vajragarbha said:]</p>
<p>“I would like to hear, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>About the characteristics of the external signs.</p>
<p>Please tell me, O great sage,</p>
<p>This secret of yogins and yoginīs.” {4.1.1}</p>
<p>The lord then entered the meditative absorption called “the power of ḍākinīs’ conquest” and explained the pledge signs of ḍākinīs. {4.1.2}</p>
<p>“The vajra (male sexual organ) is in Kollagiri</p>
<p>And the lotus (female sexual organ) is in Muṃmuni.</p>
<p>The rattle of the wood (hand-drum) is unbroken;</p>
<p>It sounds for compassion, not for quarrels. {4.1.3}</p>
<p>“Here we eat strength (meat)</p>
<p>And drink passion (wine) extravagantly.</p>
<p>Hey, the Kāliñjaras (worthy ones) may enter here;</p>
<p>The emissions (unworthy ones) are excluded. {4.1.4}</p>
<p>“We ingest the four ingredients (feces)—</p>
<p>Also musk (urine), olibanum (menstrual blood), and camphor (semen).</p>
<p>Here we eat jasmine wood (condiments) and rice products (human flesh)</p>
<p>To our satisfaction. {4.1.5}</p>
<p>“We do swinging (coming) and phlegm (going)</p>
<p>Without thinking in terms of ‘pure’ and ‘impure.’</p>
<p>Our bodies are naked (adorned with bone ornaments).</p>
<p>Here we enter the corpse (our refuge). {4.1.6}</p>
<p>“At the sandalwood (our meeting) we perform the olibanum (sex act);</p>
<p>Here small drums (the untouchables) are not shunned. {4.1.7}</p>
<p>“Mukhe, ghoghu, gughu, mughu, lughu, duṣṭu—one should enthusiastically utter these code words when the signs of a yoginī are seen. {4.1.8}</p>
<p>“And also:</p>
<p>“Ḍā, ḍī, pu, su, mā, yo, bhī, vī, lu, strī, sa(?), pe, phī(?), bha, bhū, pī, dū, ḍī, ma, strī, kū, hā, ja, ke, bha, sva,pra, jā, o, mā, go, rā, de, mā, kā,tri, ko, ka, la, kā, hi, mre(?), śri, sau, su, na, si, ma, ku. {4.1.9}</p>
<p>“Now I shall explain the outer secret signs</p>
<p>In the prescribed order,</p>
<p>Through which a [vajra] brother or sister</p>
<p>Can be recognized without doubt. {4.1.10}</p>
<p>“The potaṅgī gesture is answered with the same. Other code words and signs used are gamu, lumba, ‘swallowing,’ ‘wooden vessel,’ ‘heart,’ ‘Kuru woman,’ ‘earring,’ alikaraṇa, ‘boar,’ ‘hearing,’ ‘churning,’ ‘man,’ ‘palm of the hand,’ ‘hell,’ ‘someone,’ kākhilā, ‘sighing,’ ‘enclosure,’ ‘cessation,’ ‘cruel one,’ ‘end,’ ‘scorpion,’ ‘younger sister,’ mudaka, ‘the grasping one’ which means ‘mudrā,’ ‘touching the teeth,’ ‘perfume seller,’ ‘arrival’ which means ‘from what place,’ ‘ray of light,’ ‘hanging down,’ ‘teeth,’ ‘cessation,’ ‘report,’ ‘smoke,’ ‘fond of smoke,’ ‘summit,’ ‘rivulets,’ ‘finger,’ ‘mouth,’ ‘stripe(?),’ ‘eating,’ ‘series,’ ‘intention,’ ‘movement,’ ‘lord of animals,’ ‘circle,’ ‘the same,’ phālguṣa, ‘great syllable,’ chā, nā, go, ma, bhā, hā, ‘makers of offerings(?),’ and ‘remaining.’ A particular message is conveyed when one is touching one’s mouth or one’s teeth. ‘Bashful.’ A particular message is conveyed when one is touching space, or touching one’s thighs below. The signs and their responses are thus laid down.” {4.1.11}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the fourth chapter on the secret language of letters and speech.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Listen, O most compassionate Vajragarbha,</p>
<p>With undivided attention. {4.2.1}</p>
<p>“Dākinīs are known to be of seven types:</p>
<p>Rūpikā, Cumbikā, Lāmā,</p>
<p>Parāvṛttā, Samālikā,</p>
<p>Anivṛttikā, and Aihikī. {4.2.2}</p>
<p>“She who gazes with passion</p>
<p>And then frowns,</p>
<p>Whose beauty seduces at first</p>
<p>But later brings ruin,</p>
<p>Is known as Rūpikā, the beautiful;</p>
<p>She is served in nonduality by the valiant. {4.2.3}</p>
<p>“She who kisses a child as soon as she sees it,</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the child is lovable or not,</p>
<p>Is known as Cumbikā, the kisser.</p>
<p>This ḍākinī is very congenial. {4.2.4}</p>
<p>“She who has an animal gaze and an angry expression,</p>
<p>Who threatens with her knitted eyebrows,</p>
<p>And frightens others with her heavy sighs,</p>
<p>Is to be known as Lāmā. {4.2.5}</p>
<p>“She who frightens away</p>
<p>All wild boars, jackals, cats, and horses</p>
<p>Is called Parāvṛttā, the one who repels. {4.2.6}</p>
<p>“She who is happy and laughs gregariously,</p>
<p>And who, once gone, never returns</p>
<p>Is known as Samālikā. {4.2.7}</p>
<p>“She by whose touch, when she is upset, one will die—</p>
<p>Whether it be by her hand, a clod of earth where she walked,</p>
<p>Her foot, the end of her garment, or a stick that she touched—</p>
<p>Is called Anivṛttikā. {4.2.8}</p>
<p>“She who laughs, talks, cries,</p>
<p>Or suddenly gets angry</p>
<p>Is known as Aihikā,</p>
<p>The ḍākinī, mother of yogins. {4.2.9}</p>
<p>“They each hold a skull cup, an axe, an elephant tusk, a banner made from crocodile skin, a sword, a lance, and a conch, which are known to be their seven respective implements. {4.2.10}</p>
<p>“The adept of yoga should always be able to recognize these signs according to the procedure of sampuṭa.” {4.2.11}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the fourth chapter on the characteristics and signs particular to demon ḍākinīs of charnel grounds.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>“Now I will teach</p>
<p>The telltale signs of the lāmās.</p>
<p>If a woman has a pink complexion,</p>
<p>And eyes elongated like lotus leaves, {4.3.1}</p>
<p>“And if she always prefers white clothes,</p>
<p>Smells of fresh sandalwood,</p>
<p>Delights in the company of bliss-gone ones,</p>
<p>And responds to affectionate glances, {4.3.2}</p>
<p>“One should draw a lotus in one’s house and worship it,</p>
<p>For she belongs to the family of Padmanarteśvara.</p>
<p>If a woman has the sign of a trident between her eyebrows,</p>
<p>A dark blue face, a white body, {4.3.3}</p>
<p>“And the hue and scent of a blue lotus,</p>
<p>One should draw a vajra scepter in one’s house and always worship it,</p>
<p>For she arises from the family of the glorious Heruka</p>
<p>And is known as the ‘tranquil ḍākinī.’ {4.3.4}</p>
<p>“If a woman has red eyes, a pink complexion,</p>
<p>Red feet and hands,</p>
<p>And is always delighted</p>
<p>In the company of goats and chickens, {4.3.5}</p>
<p>“One should draw a vajra scepter in one’s house</p>
<p>And always worship it,</p>
<p>For there is no doubt that such ḍākinīs</p>
<p>Arise from the family of glorious Heruka. {4.3.6}</p>
<p>“If a circle is visible</p>
<p>On a woman’s forehead or hand;</p>
<p>If she has a yellow and dark blue complexion,</p>
<p>And always prefers yellow clothes; {4.3.7}</p>
<p>“And if she is possessed of great beauty and grace,</p>
<p>And her head smells of flowers,</p>
<p>One should, accordingly, draw a circle in one’s house,</p>
<p>For she belongs to the Tathāgata family. {4.3.8}</p>
<p>“If a woman is black and dark blue,</p>
<p>And has prominent, white fangs;</p>
<p>If she is beautiful and unremittingly cruel</p>
<p>And always wears her hair loose; {4.3.9}</p>
<p>“And if she enjoys bathing constantly</p>
<p>And always talks a lot,</p>
<p>One should draw a vajra scepter in one’s house,</p>
<p>For such a woman arises from the family of Vajravārāhī. {4.3.10}</p>
<p>“If a woman is white with a golden hue,</p>
<p>Has bright eyes, and is hairy;</p>
<p>If a vajra scepter is visible</p>
<p>On her forehead or hand; {4.3.11}</p>
<p>“And if she is of royal stature,</p>
<p>Proud, always speaks the truth,</p>
<p>And exudes the scent of jasmine,</p>
<p>One should draw a vajra scepter in one’s house</p>
<p>And worship it continually, {4.3.12}</p>
<p>“For she is the great queen of yogins, the exalted one,</p>
<p>Arisen from the family of Khaṇḍarohā.</p>
<p>Again, if a woman is fond of eating meat</p>
<p>And her eyes are the color of collyrium; {4.3.13}</p>
<p>“If she has the sign of a spear on her forehead</p>
<p>And takes pleasure in cruel acts;</p>
<p>If she continually frequents charnel grounds</p>
<p>And is neither frightened nor squeamish; {4.3.14}</p>
<p>“And if she has a convergence of wrinkles on her forehead,</p>
<p>One should draw a skull cup in one’s house</p>
<p>And always worship it,</p>
<p>For she arises from the family of Heruka. {4.3.15}</p>
<p>“If a woman has the complexion of a rain cloud</p>
<p>And uneven teeth,</p>
<p>And if she continually commits cruel acts</p>
<p>And the teeth in the left side of her mouth protrude, {4.3.16}</p>
<p>“One should draw an axe in one’s house</p>
<p>And always worship it,</p>
<p>For there is no doubt that she is a ḍākinī,</p>
<p>Arisen from the family of Vināyaka. {4.3.17}</p>
<p>“If a woman has curly hair</p>
<p>And a round face;</p>
<p>If she typically has facial hair,</p>
<p>Long eyebrows, and body hair; {4.3.18}</p>
<p>“If she dresses in white, and is pure and gentle;</p>
<p>And if she speaks the truth unwaveringly</p>
<p>And always delights in the true Dharma,</p>
<p>She should be known as Vīrabhāginī, sister of the valiant. {4.3.19}</p>
<p>“One should make the lotus gesture to her,</p>
<p>And again, the tortoise gesture.</p>
<p>One should honor the ritual pitcher</p>
<p>As this is the prescribed “gesture of response.” {4.3.20}</p>
<p>“On the tenth lunar day</p>
<p>One should draw a lotus in one’s house.</p>
<p>Again, if a woman has fleshy lips, and elongated eyes;</p>
<p>If her eyes are reddish-yellow; {4.3.21}</p>
<p>“If she is blessed with good fortune and wealth,</p>
<p>And has the complexion of a yellow jade orchid flower;</p>
<p>If her body is long, she has long hands,</p>
<p>And if she is fond of colorful clothes; {4.3.22}</p>
<p>“If there are three lines on her forehead</p>
<p>Or at the border of her hairline above it;</p>
<p>If she laughs and rejoices;</p>
<p>If she crosses one’s path, then stops; {4.3.23}</p>
<p>“And if she is typically fond of stories about</p>
<p>People killed in battles, then,</p>
<p>If one sees a wanton woman like this,</p>
<p>One should show her the spear gesture. {4.3.24}</p>
<p>“Drawing in one’s left foot,</p>
<p>One should perform a dance.</p>
<p>A gesture prescribed in response to this</p>
<p>Is turning one’s body to the left. {4.3.25}</p>
<p>“One should worship her on the fourteenth and the eighth lunar days,</p>
<p>Having drawn the shape of a spear in one’s house—</p>
<p>This is to reflect the fact that she belongs</p>
<p>To the lāmā goddesses of the family of Amitābha, the lord of the world. {4.3.26}</p>
<p>“If a woman has a pink complexion</p>
<p>And greenish-yellow eyes;</p>
<p>If her hair is curly</p>
<p>And she wears a hair band; {4.3.27}</p>
<p>“If a single long line</p>
<p>Is etched on her forehead,</p>
<p>Extending upward,</p>
<p>And she is fond of red clothes; {4.3.28}</p>
<p>“If she continually laughs, sings,</p>
<p>And suddenly gets angry;</p>
<p>And if she always delights in quarrels,</p>
<p>Showing exceptional fickle-mindedness, {4.3.29}</p>
<p>“When one sees a wanton woman like this,</p>
<p>One should make the lance gesture.</p>
<p>A second gesture, that of the bell,</p>
<p>Should then be made with care. {4.3.30}</p>
<p>“Turning one’s body to the left</p>
<p>Is the prescribed response gesture.</p>
<p>Again, if a woman is short</p>
<p>And has thick shins, {4.3.31}</p>
<p>“And if she is typically fond of yellow clothes</p>
<p>And her clothes hang loosely around her neck—</p>
<p>When seeing a wanton woman such as this,</p>
<p>One should make the wheel gesture. {4.3.32}</p>
<p>“A second gesture, that of the conch,</p>
<p>Should then be given with care.</p>
<p>Turning one’s body to the left</p>
<p>Is the prescribed response gesture. {4.3.33}</p>
<p>“One should draw a vajra scepter in one’s house</p>
<p>On the fourteenth lunar day, right for her worship.</p>
<p>Again, if a woman is hairy all over</p>
<p>And has yellowish-black eyes; {4.3.34}</p>
<p>“If she grimaces frighteningly, baring her teeth;</p>
<p>If her face is thick, with a fleshy mouth,</p>
<p>Pouting lips, deeply set eyes,</p>
<p>And a crooked nose; {4.3.35}</p>
<p>“If she ever displays gandharva skills;</p>
<p>And if she is of the color of dark cloud and has a big belly—</p>
<p>When seeing a wanton woman like this,</p>
<p>One should make the snake gesture. {4.3.36}</p>
<p>“A second gesture, that of the lance,</p>
<p>Should be given with care.</p>
<p>As before, turning one’s body to the left</p>
<p>Is the prescribed response gesture. {4.3.37}</p>
<p>“One should draw teeth in one’s house</p>
<p>On the eleventh lunar day, right for her worship,</p>
<p>And honor them at all times.” {4.3.38}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the fourth chapter on sign gestures.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“Now I will teach more on</p>
<p>The signs of bodily gestures.</p>
<p>If a woman touches the topknot on her head,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s head. {4.4.1}</p>
<p>“If she points at her forehead,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s cheek.</p>
<p>If she shows her teeth,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s tongue. {4.4.2}</p>
<p>“If she touches her lips,</p>
<p>One should point at one’s chin.</p>
<p>If she touches her neck,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s abdomen. {4.4.3}</p>
<p>“If she points at her abdomen,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s navel.</p>
<p>If she shows her bristling bodily hair,</p>
<p>One should point at the ground. {4.4.4}</p>
<p>“If she shows her secret part,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s liṅga.</p>
<p>If she shows her knee,</p>
<p>One should point at one’s shin. {4.4.5}</p>
<p>“If she shows her hand,</p>
<p>One should show her one’s arm.</p>
<p>If she shows her foot,</p>
<p>One should show her the sole of one’s foot. {4.4.6}</p>
<p>“If she shows her finger,</p>
<p>One should show her a fingernail.</p>
<p>If she points at the ground,</p>
<p>One should point at the sky. {4.4.7}</p>
<p>“If she points at the sky,</p>
<p>One should point at the sun.</p>
<p>If she points at a river,</p>
<p>One should point toward the ocean. {4.4.8}</p>
<p>“If she shows one finger,</p>
<p>This means ‘you are welcome.’</p>
<p>If she shows two fingers,</p>
<p>This means ‘you are most welcome.’ {4.4.9}</p>
<p>“If she makes a gesture with her right eyebrow,</p>
<p>One should make the same with the left eyebrow—</p>
<p>These two gestures signify the two teachers.” {4.4.10}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign fourth chapter on the sign language of vajraḍākinīs in the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa,” so called to reflect the secret foundation of all tantras.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>“Now I will teach</p>
<p>About the gathering of all sublime people.</p>
<p>There, one should consume a dish of good food,</p>
<p>Served in a dish with two compartments. {5.1.1}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked, “Blessed One, what places are places of gatherings?” {5.1.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“There are pīṭhas and auxiliary pīṭhas,</p>
<p>And likewise, kṣetras and auxiliary kṣetras.</p>
<p>There are also chandohas and auxiliary chandohas,</p>
<p>Melāpakas and auxiliary melāpakas. {5.1.3}</p>
<p>“There are charnel grounds and auxiliary charnel grounds,</p>
<p>Pīlavas and auxiliary pīlavas.</p>
<p>These are the twelve types of meeting places.</p>
<p>The lord of the ten bhūmis has not specified</p>
<p>Any places other than these twelve.” {5.1.4}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked, “O Blessed One, which places are the pīthas, and so forth? What are the twelve types of places? Please be so kind as to explain, you who are born of greatness.” {5.1.5}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Jālandhara is said to be a pīṭha,</p>
<p>And so, too, is Oḍḍiyāna.</p>
<p>Pūrṇagiri is a pīṭha,</p>
<p>And so is Arbuda. {5.1.6}</p>
<p>“Godāvarī is said to be an auxiliary pīṭha,</p>
<p>And so, too, is Rāmeśvara.</p>
<p>Devīkoṭa has been proclaimed to be likewise,</p>
<p>And so, too, Mālava. {5.1.7}</p>
<p>“Kāmarūpa and, likewise, Oḍra</p>
<p>Have been proclaimed to be kṣetras.</p>
<p>Triśakuni is an auxiliary kṣetra,</p>
<p>And so is Kośala. {5.1.8}</p>
<p>“Kaliṅga is said to be a chandoha,</p>
<p>And so, too, is Lampāka.</p>
<p>Kāñcī has been declared to be an auxiliary chandoha,</p>
<p>And so, too, has Himālaya. {5.1.9}</p>
<p>“Pretādhivāsinī is a melāpaka,</p>
<p>And so is Gṛhadevatā.</p>
<p>Sauraṣṭra is an auxiliary melāpaka,</p>
<p>As is Suvarṇadvīpa. {5.1.10}</p>
<p>“Nagara is famed as a charnel ground;</p>
<p>So, too, is Sindhu.</p>
<p>Maru is said to be an auxiliary charnel ground,</p>
<p>And so is Kulatā. {5.1.11}</p>
<p>“Kāruṇya is said to be a pīlava,</p>
<p>And so is Karmārapāṭaka.</p>
<p>Harikela is a pīlava,</p>
<p>And so is the middle of the salt ocean, Lavaṇasāgara. {5.1.12}</p>
<p>“Vindhyā and Kaumārapaurikā</p>
<p>Are auxiliary pīlavas.</p>
<p>Adjacent to them are the charnel grounds</p>
<p>Pretasaṃghāta and Udadhitaṭa.</p>
<p>Udyāna and Vāpikātīra</p>
<p>Are said to be auxiliary charnel grounds. {5.1.13}</p>
<p>“Now I will explain the manner in which such places are inhabited.</p>
<p>“Viraja is inhabited by a goddess living in a mango tree,</p>
<p>Koṅkana is inhabited by one in a somavarṇikā tree,</p>
<p>Caritra, by one in a pongamia tree,</p>
<p>And Aṭṭahāsa, by one living in a kadamba tree. {5.1.14}</p>
<p>“Devīkoṭa is inhabited by a goddess living in a banyan tree,</p>
<p>Harikela, by one in a hari tree,</p>
<p>Uḍḍiyāna, by one in an aśoka tree,</p>
<p>And Jālandhara, by one in a thorn apple tree. {5.1.15}</p>
<p>“A pīṭha is the bhūmi called Joyous,</p>
<p>And an auxiliary pīṭha, the bhūmi called Stainless.</p>
<p>A kṣetra should be known as the bhūmi Shining,</p>
<p>And an auxiliary kṣetra as Blazing Wisdom. {5.1.16}</p>
<p>“A chandoha should be known as the bhūmi Revealed,</p>
<p>And an auxiliary chandoha as Difficult to Conquer,</p>
<p>A melāpaka as the bhūmi Far Gone,</p>
<p>And an auxiliary melāpaka as Immovable. {5.1.17}</p>
<p>“A charnel ground is the bhūmi Excellent Intelligence,</p>
<p>And an auxiliary charnel ground, Cloud of Dharma.</p>
<p>The ‘barbarous’ language of the yoginī</p>
<p>Thus depicts the bhūmis of the ten perfections. {5.1.18}</p>
<p>“One should visualize, externally and internally,</p>
<p>All these different attributes as has been explained. {5.1.19}</p>
<p>“In addition, I will explain what days are suitable for a successful gathering of yoginīs.</p>
<p>“The fourteenth and the eighth day</p>
<p>Of the moon’s waning fortnight are particularly recommended</p>
<p>For consuming someone killed by a banner or a weapon,</p>
<p>Or one who has been born seven times. {5.1.20}</p>
<p>“Generating compassion with ardor,</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should perform the act of killing.</p>
<p>Since those devoid of compassion will not succeed,</p>
<p>One should therefore train in compassion. {5.1.21}</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I feel for myself, so too should I for sentient beings.</p>
<p>I am just as any other living being.’</p>
<p>Reflecting thus, and remaining in union with the deity,</p>
<p>One will swiftly attain success.” {5.1.22}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the fifth chapter on meeting places.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“I would like to hear, O lord of knowledge,</p>
<p>About the characteristic of the secret lotus.</p>
<p>What is its use in the stages of attaining ultimate awakening,</p>
<p>In which mind is mingled with gnosis?” {5.2.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“In reliance upon the Catuṣpīṭha Tantra,</p>
<p>A vajra holder progressing toward perfect awakening</p>
<p>Should give rise to an attitude of equanimity,</p>
<p>Casting aside his desires, and so forth. {5.2.2}</p>
<p>“He should sit on a comfortable seat,</p>
<p>In a pleasant place,</p>
<p>With thoughts of compassion and benevolence</p>
<p>For all animate and inanimate things. {5.2.3}</p>
<p>“He should then visualize the central channel</p>
<p>From top to bottom: the ‘end of sound,’ the secret lotus,</p>
<p>And likewise, the different seats</p>
<p>With their parts and their different letters. {5.2.4}</p>
<p>“Vajra body, speech, and mind,</p>
<p>Made manifest from within the sphere of phenomena,</p>
<p>Are then brought together, and through the ‘embryo’ method</p>
<p>He becomes Vajrasattva. {5.2.5}</p>
<p>“In the highest state,</p>
<p>Where the elements of water and fire become one taste,</p>
<p>The natures of means and gnosis are joined in union</p>
<p>And the six sense faculties become reflections of the Buddha. {5.2.6}</p>
<p>“He becomes a teacher of authentic treatises,</p>
<p>And a follower of scripture who understands the truth.</p>
<p>He will truly reach the other shore—</p>
<p>The state of reality, the secret meaning. {5.2.7}</p>
<p>“Having cleansed the body of impurities through applying</p>
<p>The characteristics of reality, such as emptiness and the like,</p>
<p>To all the previous characteristics,</p>
<p>He will win the stages of perfect awakening. {5.2.8}</p>
<p>“In the center of a moon disk</p>
<p>He should visualize the wisdom being,</p>
<p>White as a jasmine flower or the moon,</p>
<p>Emanating rays of moonlight. {5.2.9}</p>
<p>“The wisdom being has two arms</p>
<p>And sits on a lotus in sattvaparyaṅka posture.</p>
<p>He is adorned with all kinds of jewelry</p>
<p>And with the crown of the five buddhas. {5.2.10}</p>
<p>“His two hands, which he presses against his chest,</p>
<p>Display the gesture of the great seal.</p>
<p>He is possessed of great beauty and splendor.</p>
<p>Such is the meditation on the wisdom being. {5.2.11}</p>
<p>“He should visualize a plantain flower at his navel,</p>
<p>Endowed with all the aforementioned characteristics</p>
<p>And reaching up as far as his heart.</p>
<p>It opens there, revealing the original lotus flower. {5.2.12}</p>
<p>“The lotus has eight exquisite petals,</p>
<p>Filaments, and filament bulbs.</p>
<p>He should then place the syllables on the petals</p>
<p>[And visualize himself as Vajrasattva] sitting at the center of the maṇḍala. {5.2.13}</p>
<p>“He should visualize him with two arms and one face,</p>
<p>White, divinely beautiful, and without any blemishes.</p>
<p>In the center of his body he should visualize [the syllable of] consciousness,</p>
<p>Joining it with his own awareness. {5.2.14}</p>
<p>“On the eastern petal, the petal of Akṣobhya,</p>
<p>There is the syllable of Akṣobhya joined with loving kindness.</p>
<p>On the petal at the southern gate</p>
<p>There is the syllable of Ratnasambhava joined with compassion. {5.2.15}</p>
<p>“On the petal of the western gate,</p>
<p>He should place the syllable of Amitābha,</p>
<p>And at the location of the northern gate,</p>
<p>The syllable of the mind of mighty Amoghasiddhi. {5.2.16}</p>
<p>“He should thus arrange the four syllables—</p>
<p>Those that begin with a vowel and others,</p>
<p>Adding the sign of candrabindu as required—</p>
<p>All adorned with white moonlight. {5.2.17}</p>
<p>“On the intermediate petals he should place</p>
<p>The previously mentioned four neuter syllables (ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ).</p>
<p>In the center of them</p>
<p>He should add the mind syllable (hūṁ).” {5.2.18}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“My curiosity has been aroused, so please tell me,</p>
<p>O Blessed One, how is it that despite</p>
<p>Everything being empty and without characteristic,</p>
<p>There is yoga, and so forth, involving syllables?” {5.2.19}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Hear the truth, Vajragarbha,</p>
<p>About the emptiness of objects and their properties —</p>
<p>It is like how a plantain tree, itself without essence,</p>
<p>Yields fruit that is the ambrosia of essences. {5.2.20}</p>
<p>“In the center there is cognition-gnosis,</p>
<p>Corresponding in nature to formless cognizance.</p>
<p>One cannot find there any characteristic,</p>
<p>For it is the stainless body of gnosis. {5.2.21}</p>
<p>“Free of being either entity or non-entity,</p>
<p>Syllabic forms emerge from where there are none.</p>
<p>At their core is an empty essence,</p>
<p>Whose reality the yogin must apprehend. {5.2.22}</p>
<p>“Once this property has been properly cognized</p>
<p>With a mind steeped in the gnosis of equality,</p>
<p>It will soon be seen that he is</p>
<p>On the path to perfect awakening. {5.2.23}</p>
<p>“This path relies on the guru’s instructions</p>
<p>As it involves the nature of gnosis-consciousness.</p>
<p>Its properties are indicated in treatises;</p>
<p>Its reality, however, is pointed out by the valiant instructor. {5.2.24}</p>
<p>“He should always visualize it</p>
<p>As engulfed in white light,</p>
<p>And imagine it with the other seed syllables of the [five] ambrosias,</p>
<p>In a stūpa with five layers. {5.2.25}</p>
<p>“The bodhicitta drop, sublime with the glow of white light,</p>
<p>Overflows with a stream of ambrosia.</p>
<p>At the heart, in the center of the lotus containing the syllables,</p>
<p>Is an orb the size of a thumb. {5.2.26}</p>
<p>“In its center there are syllables</p>
<p>Embodying all vowels and consonants,</p>
<p>Radiant white in color,</p>
<p>Emitting rays of moonlight. {5.2.27}</p>
<p>“At the openings in their center</p>
<p>There is a drop, consisting of what is known as consciousness,</p>
<p>As fine as one hundredth of a hair tip,</p>
<p>In the form of an infinitesimally small particle. {5.2.28}</p>
<p>“Since it is the nature of the consciousness</p>
<p>Of those who cognize objects and their properties,</p>
<p>Look into the state of abiding as the drop—</p>
<p>It is characterized by non-perception and non-thought. {5.2.29}</p>
<p>“The consciousness-gnosis may be grasped</p>
<p>By relying on the guru’s instructions</p>
<p>Regarding the descent of the drop</p>
<p>From the opening at the fontanel down to the heart. {5.2.30}</p>
<p>“The outsiders will not find the right path,</p>
<p>Which is difficult to find even with the aid of treatises.</p>
<p>Such treatises are easy to find,</p>
<p>But the practices described therein are difficult to discern. {5.2.31}</p>
<p>“He should eagerly follow the guru’s instructions,</p>
<p>Applying the methods used by yogins.</p>
<p>By following the path shown by the guru, a wise practitioner</p>
<p>Will be able to discern the practices described in treatises. {5.2.32}</p>
<p>“Fully collected, he should meditate merging with the essence,</p>
<p>Unwavering and untroubled.</p>
<p>Phenomena are preceded by the mind;</p>
<p>They are purified by mind and have the swiftness of thought. {5.2.33}</p>
<p>“It is through the mind, with its king-like grace,</p>
<p>That one speaks and acts.</p>
<p>Thus, with everything being the nature of mind,</p>
<p>The wise one knows that he is born from mind. {5.2.34}</p>
<p>“The yogin should recite the mantra as he likes,</p>
<p>Keeping his attention on his heart,</p>
<p>For it is not the principal natures (tattva) that</p>
<p>Constitute the cause, but the seed syllables. {5.2.35}</p>
<p>“Since the seed syllables comprise cause and effect,</p>
<p>The principal natures should not be viewed as such.</p>
<p>The five syllables to be visualized are</p>
<p>The fivefold experience of existence, of form, and so forth. {5.2.36}</p>
<p>“As he is carried around everywhere,</p>
<p>He should place these syllables in the central channel.</p>
<p>Thus the syllables of gnosis and cognition should be placed</p>
<p>At the roots of the three channels that always need to be blocked. {5.2.37}</p>
<p>“When he longs for experiences of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>He should join these syllables, in mental recitation,</p>
<p>With the ‘sound’ (long ū) and the ‘drop’ (anunāsika),</p>
<p>Without, however, saying them aloud. {5.2.38}</p>
<p>“He will definitively and perpetually</p>
<p>Come to abide, together with the buddhas,</p>
<p>In the state that is always subtle and stainless,</p>
<p>And where gnosis and cognition merge. {5.2.39}</p>
<p>“With its presence as gnosis, cognition may</p>
<p>Then be observed in its progression toward perfect awakening.</p>
<p>The first sign to be observed</p>
<p>For all practitioners is the form of a bright flame. {5.2.40}</p>
<p>“The second sign revealed</p>
<p>Is sparkling dust resembling fireflies—</p>
<p>It will be seen as circular shapes of white powder</p>
<p>Formed throughout the ten direction. {5.2.41}</p>
<p>“The third sign observed by practitioners</p>
<p>Is the disappearance of afflictions.</p>
<p>The fourth one to be revealed</p>
<p>Is the experience of the pleasures of gods from the desire realm. {5.2.42}</p>
<p>“The fifth sign mentally perceived</p>
<p>Is the experience of the delights of the form realm,</p>
<p>The sixth is the pleasures of the formless realm,</p>
<p>And the seventh is those experienced by the buddhas. {5.2.43}</p>
<p>“With the arrival of the eighth sign, practitioners</p>
<p>Can experience at will the fruition that is the goal of awakening. {5.2.44}</p>
<p>“Listen, O most compassionate Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>With undivided attention!</p>
<p>“Definitely all things are known</p>
<p>To possess purity as their essence.</p>
<p>Subsequent to this, the deities are explained,</p>
<p>One by one, according to their divisions. {5.2.45}</p>
<p>“The aggregates, elements, and sense-fields</p>
<p>Of embodied beings are pure by nature.</p>
<p>Though veiled by ignorance and afflictions, they can be purified.</p>
<p>Being the nature of one’s own awakening, they are themselves pure,</p>
<p>Such that one is not liberated through some extrinsic purity. {5.2.46}</p>
<p>“With the purity of sense objects,</p>
<p>Self-reflexive awareness is the ultimate bliss.</p>
<p>Objects of form, and so forth,</p>
<p>And whatever else appears to practitioners, {5.2.47}</p>
<p>“Are all pure by nature,</p>
<p>For everything is comprised of wakefulness.” {5.2.48}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked, “O Blessed One, what are the things that are impure?” {5.2.49}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “They are form, and so forth. Why are they impure? Because they involve apprehended object and apprehending subject.”</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked, “Well, what then are apprehended object and apprehending subject?” {5.2.50}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said,</p>
<p>“Form is apprehended by the eye;</p>
<p>Sound, by the ear;</p>
<p>Odors, by the nose;</p>
<p>And taste, by the tongue. {5.2.51}</p>
<p>“A physical object is felt by the body</p>
<p>And the mind apprehends happiness, and so forth.</p>
<p>These sense objects ought to be enjoyed</p>
<p>After purifying them by removing poison. {5.2.52}</p>
<p>“Form is Buddha Vairocana,</p>
<p>Sensation is Vajrasūrya,</p>
<p>Perception is Padmanarteśvara,</p>
<p>Predispositions are Vajrarāja, {5.2.53}</p>
<p>“Consciousness is Vajrasattva—</p>
<p>The inherent nature of everything is Heruka.</p>
<p>The eye is called Mohavajra;</p>
<p>The ear has the name Dveṣavajra. {5.2.54}</p>
<p>“Īrṣyāvajra is the nose,</p>
<p>Rāgavajra is the mouth,</p>
<p>Mātsaryavajra is touch,</p>
<p>And Heruka, the supreme lord, is all the sensory fields and elements. {5.2.55}</p>
<p>“Pātanī is the element of earth;</p>
<p>The element of water is known as Māraṇī.</p>
<p>Ākarṣaṇī is the element of fire;</p>
<p>The element of wind is Narteśvarī. {5.2.56}</p>
<p>“The element of space is said to be</p>
<p>Padmajvālinī, because of her imperturbability.</p>
<p>In this way the bodies of embodied beings—</p>
<p>Their aggregates, and so forth—have the nature of deities. {5.2.57}</p>
<p>“Pleasure and pain, and acting on them,</p>
<p>Generate afflictive emotions, and the rest—</p>
<p>Following one’s lot resulting from this generation,</p>
<p>One will incur either cyclic existence or its cessation.” {5.2.58}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the fifth chapter on the purity of the aggregates, and so forth.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>“Now, the right practice, which destroys</p>
<p>The enemy, conceptual thinking, will be explained;</p>
<p>Distilled from the totality of Buddha’s teachings,</p>
<p>This practice of reality is supreme. {5.3.1}</p>
<p>“For the sake of the Buddha’s sons,</p>
<p>Who are established in perfect awakening,</p>
<p>This practice, the ultimate Perfection of Wisdom,</p>
<p>Will be truthfully explained by Anaṅgavajra. {5.3.2}</p>
<p>“Like a boat safely sailing on,</p>
<p>She delivers all beings</p>
<p>From the terrifying ocean of births,</p>
<p>Rough with the waves of old age, and so forth. {5.3.3}</p>
<p>“She, the divine one, quickly brings accomplishment,</p>
<p>Being an essential receptacle of all good qualities.</p>
<p>Manifested from the jewel of the mind,</p>
<p>She fulfills everyone’s desired aim. {5.3.4}</p>
<p>“Since without her, who is praised by Vajradhara</p>
<p>And constitutes the body of qualities of all the perfectly awakened ones,</p>
<p>Accomplishment is not possible, the wise ones who desire liberation</p>
<p>Should perform this unequaled practice. {5.3.5}</p>
<p>“The lotuses of her feet are worshiped by Viṣṇu, Indra,</p>
<p>Śiva Mahādeva, Kubera, Brahmā, and so forth.</p>
<p>By doing this practice that removes sin,</p>
<p>The tathāgatas swiftly attained the ultimate state. {5.3.6}</p>
<p>“This practice of the central channel has been taught</p>
<p>By the glorious Vajrasattva for the benefit of the world. {5.3.7}</p>
<p>“Accordingly, the practitioner should cultivate</p>
<p>This sublime inconceivable state in great secrecy.</p>
<p>He should engage in this samaya practice</p>
<p>While free of all concepts. {5.3.8}</p>
<p>“In the initial stage, the practitioner should abide</p>
<p>With the natural outflow of the existing condition.</p>
<p>Then, should he tire from meditation,</p>
<p>He should take a break, adopting the playfulness of a child. {5.3.9}</p>
<p>“For the sake of different types of people who require guidance,</p>
<p>He should visualize himself in the gentle form of Mañjuśrī. {5.3.10}</p>
<p>“Everything known as accomplishment comes about through</p>
<p>Different practices accordingly taught; there is, however, an unexcelled practice</p>
<p>That brings about the unparalleled accomplishment of Samantabhadra—</p>
<p>It is this practice that the Blessed Vajrasattva has taught. {5.3.11}</p>
<p>“Always paying homage to his protector,</p>
<p>The glorious vajra master,</p>
<p>He should rely on the secret practice,</p>
<p>Doing what needs to be done and maintaining a noble heart. {5.3.12}</p>
<p>“Then, following his inclinations</p>
<p>While turning away from all attachments,</p>
<p>He should comport himself while in touch with reality,</p>
<p>In every respect like a lion. {5.3.13}</p>
<p>“Through perfectly knowing things as they are,</p>
<p>And thus forming the intention to deliver the world,</p>
<p>He comes to embody full mastery of the correct view,</p>
<p>With a steadfast mind free of reference points. {5.3.14}</p>
<p>“All attributes such as the aggregates, elements,</p>
<p>And so forth are like a dream and an illusion.</p>
<p>Knowing the entire triple universe</p>
<p>To be, in short, like this, {5.3.15}</p>
<p>“He should associate with those</p>
<p>Who live free from all obscurations,</p>
<p>Casting far away</p>
<p>All the eight worldly concerns. {5.3.16}</p>
<p>“Always free of concepts,</p>
<p>He should gain certainty about the nondual state,</p>
<p>And apply the six perfections</p>
<p>In order to attain the accomplishment of an awakened one. {5.3.17}</p>
<p>“Although eminently engaged for the welfare of beings,</p>
<p>He should not form concepts about them.</p>
<p>He should set his mind on awakening</p>
<p>And embark on the practice of conquering the directions. {5.3.18}</p>
<p>“Being the embodiment of wisdom and means conjoined,</p>
<p>And turning away from all attachments,</p>
<p>He will succeed even in this lifetime</p>
<p>If he exerts himself in the cultivation of true reality. {5.3.19}</p>
<p>“Free of all concepts and, in particular,</p>
<p>Of ideas about other beings,</p>
<p>He should enjoy anything at all, applying the understanding</p>
<p>That things are like an illusion, and so forth. {5.3.20}</p>
<p>“Having arisen from the undifferentiated sphere of phenomena,</p>
<p>No beings can become his adversaries.</p>
<p>He should enjoy things as he pleases</p>
<p>With a mindset free of hesitation. {5.3.21}</p>
<p>“All this is for the sake of enjoyment—</p>
<p>This entire triple universe,</p>
<p>Conjured up by Vajrasattva</p>
<p>For practitioners’ benefit. {5.3.22}</p>
<p>“If, by attaining infinite gnosis,</p>
<p>He does not need to worship the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>What need is there to mention initiations, and so forth,</p>
<p>For him constantly engaged in meditation? {5.3.23}</p>
<p>“The nature of all objects</p>
<p>Is the nature of awakened mind.</p>
<p>That alone is the Blessed One, the vajra holder.</p>
<p>Therefore, that alone is the identity of the deities. {5.3.24}</p>
<p>“Neither maṇḍalas nor fasts are to be performed,</p>
<p>Nor the formation of gestures or caityas.</p>
<p>Also other things</p>
<p>Taught by the glorious vajra lord</p>
<p>Out of his great dedication—</p>
<p>Of what use would they be to he who knows reality? {5.3.25}</p>
<p>“Just as one who seeks ambrosia</p>
<p>Should discard the buttermilk after taking the fresh butter,</p>
<p>So should he discard all thoughts</p>
<p>After obtaining the ambrosia of Dharma. {5.3.26}</p>
<p>“When the wise practitioner is without concepts,</p>
<p>Has given up doubt, and is free of reference points,</p>
<p>Then, just as Vajra Mind has said,</p>
<p>There is no doubt he will succeed. {5.3.27}</p>
<p>“Because of concepts, he will go to hell</p>
<p>And wander in the ocean of cyclic existence, with its six destinies.</p>
<p>But free from concepts, he will be liberated,</p>
<p>Reaching the state of stainless tranquility. {5.3.28}</p>
<p>“Therefore, in order to destroy the net of concepts</p>
<p>He should regularly practice the samaya observances,</p>
<p>Which were performed by the awakened one,</p>
<p>Abiding by them wherever he may be. {5.3.29}</p>
<p>“They should be performed by someone who knows mantra,</p>
<p>Without excessive attachment, but not eschewing anything.</p>
<p>They all without exception should be regarded</p>
<p>By applying the understanding of the non-arising of forms. {5.3.30}</p>
<p>“He should drink the blood of dogs, donkeys, camels, elephants, and so on,</p>
<p>And eat their meat regularly.</p>
<p>Human meat smeared with blood</p>
<p>Should be regarded as the best of all. {5.3.31}</p>
<p>“He should eat all kinds of poor meats,</p>
<p>And the excellent meats containing hundreds of thousands of living creatures.</p>
<p>The practitioner should also eat terribly putrid feces</p>
<p>Swarming with hundreds of worms, {5.3.32}</p>
<p>“And keenly relish meat</p>
<p>Mixed with dog and human vomit,</p>
<p>Dowsed with vajra water, covered in flies,</p>
<p>And blended with feces. {5.3.33}</p>
<p>“He should drink vajra water. When meat cannot be found anywhere, in order to partake of it he should imagine something else in the form of meat and eat that. {5.3.34}</p>
<p>“Foodstuffs inedible to others are edible for the master of the true state. Places improper to visit are fine for him to visit. Things improper to do are proper for him. The follower of the mantra path must not think in terms of ‘fit to visit’ and ‘unfit to visit’; ‘edible’ and ‘inedible’; ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’; or ‘drinkable’ and ‘undrinkable.’ {5.3.35}</p>
<p>“He should be content in body, speech, and mind. In order to be free of mental agitation, the practitioner should always drink wine. Like the victorious ones, he should regard all things, whether repulsive or greatly enjoyable, colorful or plain, delightful or depressing, as identical. {5.3.36}</p>
<p>“He should not recite texts, assemble maṇḍalas, or gather flowers. He should not recite mantras, nor should he pay homage to the deity, consecrated things, and so forth. He should speak false words and approach the charming wives of others. He should have no loving kindness for rogues, and should kill buddhas and other living beings. {5.3.37}</p>
<p>“The wise practitioner, however, should always worship his teacher, venerated by the victorious ones, who is the wisdom and the pledge being—the best of all beings, and who is the samaya that bestows various accomplishments. Since whatever merit is possessed by the fully awakened ones and the bodhisattvas dwelling throughout the ten directions can be seen in the openings of the master’s pores, the buddhas rejoice at seeing the bodhisattvas worship the master. {5.3.38}</p>
<p>“Since the buddhas with whom he has the bond of samaya will grant the desired awakening, he should never criticize the teacher and never disrespect his siblings on the vajra path. Accepting whatever is offered, he should not pay homage to caityas. Regarding his blood brothers, sons, and father, as well as the kingdom with its pleasures, treasuries, riches, and granaries to all be like grass, he should gain dominion over the three realms.” {5.3.39}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the fifth chapter describing the post-initiatory observances.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“Now I will teach about the signs indicating a full adoption of post-initiatory practice. {5.4.1}</p>
<p>“By these signs the vajra practitioner</p>
<p>Can be recognized from afar without any doubt.</p>
<p>He should eat and drink whatever food is found,</p>
<p>Comprising the oblation to a ḍākinī, and so forth. {5.4.2}</p>
<p>“Wearing clothes and a kaupīna from a corpse,</p>
<p>And smeared with ashes from a cremated body,</p>
<p>He should wander around at night,</p>
<p>In secret, carrying a bowl made from a broken skull. {5.4.3}</p>
<p>“At a crossroads, on a mountain,</p>
<p>Under a lone tree, or in a charnel ground—</p>
<p>It is said that in these four places</p>
<p>The meditation of the follower of Mantra will be effective. {5.4.4}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, in a mātṛkās’ temple at night,</p>
<p>Or in an isolated place, or the wilderness,</p>
<p>When some heat has been generated,</p>
<p>He can do the following practice if he wishes to. {5.4.5}</p>
<p>“If he wants accomplishment for himself,</p>
<p>He should start behaving like a child again.</p>
<p>A practitioner of keen intellect should roam about</p>
<p>With the purpose of benefiting sentient beings. {5.4.6}</p>
<p>“With his mind free of attachment,</p>
<p>And always wearing colorful clothes,</p>
<p>The practitioner should imagine that from the pores of his skin</p>
<p>Radiate deities throughout the ten directions. {5.4.7}</p>
<p>“With himself transformed into Mañjuvajra,</p>
<p>He should visualize the circle of his retinue of deities.</p>
<p>The practitioner should do this in a pleasant lotus garden</p>
<p>At a confluence of rivers. {5.4.8}</p>
<p>“Should he stay there and meditate,</p>
<p>He will swiftly attain accomplishment.</p>
<p>Alternatively, he should sojourn in a cave</p>
<p>Or on a mountain peak, with a focused mind. {5.4.9}</p>
<p>“He should eat whatever he finds;</p>
<p>Whenever he eats, he should offer an oblation,</p>
<p>And he should bedeck himself with various fruits, garlands, and so forth,</p>
<p>And likewise with little bundles of flowers, and so forth. {5.4.10}</p>
<p>“He should dress in clothes from the skins of living creatures.</p>
<p>Aspiring for bliss, he is conferred bliss.</p>
<p>He should recite sometimes in Sanskrit</p>
<p>And, conversely, sometimes in Prakrit. {5.4.11}</p>
<p>“In the vein of a madman, he should eat whatever he finds, whether it is regarded as fit for eating or not, roaming throughout other countries, renowned mountain caves, groves, great ancient charnel grounds, and the shores of great oceans. {5.4.12}</p>
<p>“Staying in such places, the wise practitioner should meditate</p>
<p>Completely free of all fear.</p>
<p>But once having done so, he should embark</p>
<p>On the conquest of the quarters. {5.4.13}</p>
<p>“Completely free of every obscuration,</p>
<p>He should fulfill the wishes</p>
<p>Of all the residents throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>Who are veiled by the obscurations concomitant with birth. {5.4.14}</p>
<p>“When he has completely abandoned through meditation</p>
<p>All involvement with apprehended objects and apprehending subjects,</p>
<p>And all his meditation becomes like this,</p>
<p>He is called “the conqueror of the quarters.” {5.4.15}</p>
<p>“Having then attained some stability,</p>
<p>The practitioner of the real state is unassailable.</p>
<p>He can summon vidyā goddesses</p>
<p>And make the most beautiful one his lover. {5.4.16}</p>
<p>“It could be an apsaras, who is a charming gem</p>
<p>And attends to the gratification of vidyādharas,</p>
<p>Or it could be a celestial daughter, a yakṣiṇī,</p>
<p>A nāginī, or an asurī. {5.4.17}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should summon,</p>
<p>From among them, one vidyā, pleasing to his mind.</p>
<p>He should subdue her</p>
<p>By means of a goad and a noose, {5.4.18}</p>
<p>“Until this deity grants all objects that may be useful,</p>
<p>Without his having to beg for them.</p>
<p>Free from disease and old age, not swayed by opposites,</p>
<p>He will remain in the three worlds free from sin. {5.4.19}</p>
<p>“Having offered his body as a gift,</p>
<p>The practitioner should then start his samaya practice.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the gift should not be given</p>
<p>Based on consideration of whether the recipient is worthy or not. {5.4.20}</p>
<p>“He should partake of solid and liquid food and drink</p>
<p>Just as they happen to come by.</p>
<p>He must not grasp in that regard,</p>
<p>Deliberating in terms of what is “desirable” and “undesirable.” {5.4.21}</p>
<p>“He should be free from training and initiations</p>
<p>And know that there is no need for him to feel ashamed of anything.</p>
<p>The practitioner should analyze such things with great compassion,</p>
<p>According to the empty nature of all things. {5.4.22}</p>
<p>“Having gone beyond oblatory rites and austerities,</p>
<p>He should likewise remain free from mantra recitation and meditation.</p>
<p>Freed from the rules of such conduct and firmly established</p>
<p>In deity yoga, he should do his observances accordingly. {5.4.23}</p>
<p>“Even if a demon as powerful as Indra</p>
<p>Should clearly appear before him,</p>
<p>He must not be afraid,</p>
<p>But wander about like a lion. {5.4.24}</p>
<p>“For the sake of benefiting all beings,</p>
<p>He should always drink compassion as his drink.</p>
<p>Delighting likewise in the drink of yoga,</p>
<p>The practitioner should not immerse himself in other drinks. {5.4.25}</p>
<p>“Now another samaya practice is described—</p>
<p>That of the glorious position of a crown prince,</p>
<p>Through which the final accomplishment is reached</p>
<p>For the sake of benefiting all beings. {5.4.26}</p>
<p>“The meditator should put on his ears</p>
<p>A set of fine earrings;</p>
<p>On his head, a crown;</p>
<p>On his wrists, a pair of bracelets; {5.4.27}</p>
<p>“On his hips, a waist chain;</p>
<p>On his ankles, a pair of anklets;</p>
<p>At the root of his upper arm, an arm bracelet;</p>
<p>And on his neck, a necklace of bone. {5.4.28}</p>
<p>“He should cover himself in a tiger skin</p>
<p>And eat the five ambrosias.</p>
<p>If he is a man, he should remain in the absorption</p>
<p>Of the Heruka yoga. {5.4.29}</p>
<p>“He should find a girl from the vajra family</p>
<p>With a beautiful face and elongated eyes,</p>
<p>Who has been consecrated by himself and is compassionately disposed.</p>
<p>Having obtained such a girl, he should learn the observance of consort practice. {5.4.30}</p>
<p>“If a girl from the vajra family is not available,</p>
<p>He should go for one from the family of his chosen deity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, he should take a girl from another family,</p>
<p>Consecrated with the seed of awakening. {5.4.31}</p>
<p>“When a song is sung, it should be</p>
<p>A supreme song related to vajra.</p>
<p>When joy has arisen,</p>
<p>He should dance as a cause of liberation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the practitioner should always</p>
<p>Do his dance with vajra steps. {5.4.32}</p>
<p>“Akṣobhya is recollected by the crown,</p>
<p>Amitābha by the earrings,</p>
<p>Ratnasambhava by the necklace,</p>
<p>And Vairocana by the wrist bracelets. {5.4.33}</p>
<p>“Amoghasiddhi resides in the waist chain,</p>
<p>And the consort (prajñā) takes on the form of the khaṭvāṅga.</p>
<p>The practitioner should always eat medicinal herbs</p>
<p>And drink water. {5.4.34}</p>
<p>“Old age and death will not take hold of him,</p>
<p>And he will always be protected.</p>
<p>He should fashion a tiara with the hair of a thief</p>
<p>And place there that which comes from hūṁ. {5.4.35}</p>
<p>“He should wear five skulls representing the five buddhas</p>
<p>As part of his practice of deity yoga.</p>
<p>Making the skull pieces five finger-widths in length,</p>
<p>He should keep them fastened to the tiara. {5.4.36}</p>
<p>“A doubly-twined cord of hair</p>
<p>Represents wisdom and means.</p>
<p>The practitioner should wear, as part of his practice,</p>
<p>Charnel ground ashes and a sacred cord made of a corpse’s hair. {5.4.37}</p>
<p>“His recitation is the sound of his ḍamaru,</p>
<p>Which invites all sentient beings to be his guests.</p>
<p>This should be the nature of his recitation,</p>
<p>While he himself should become Vajrakapāla. {5.4.38}</p>
<p>“He should avoid greed, stupidity, fear, anger,</p>
<p>And the idea that shame is necessary.</p>
<p>Embodying the nature of Heruka,</p>
<p>The practitioner should mix with members of all the five castes. {5.4.39}</p>
<p>“He should recognize only one caste</p>
<p>As comprising the five castes,</p>
<p>For the distinction between many</p>
<p>And just one caste should not be made. {5.4.40}</p>
<p>“He should without doubt perform the practice</p>
<p>While depriving himself of sleep.” {5.4.41}</p>
<p>This concludes the chapter on the practice, the fifth in the “Emergence from Sampuṭa.”</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>[The goddess said:]</p>
<p>“I would be interested to hear, my lord,</p>
<p>What are the stages of self-consecration?</p>
<p>What is the purpose of secrecy?” {6.1.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Listen, O most compassionate Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>With undivided attention!</p>
<p>I will now briefly explain the definitive meaning</p>
<p>Common to all tantras. {6.1.2}</p>
<p>“What is referred to with the letter e (the dharmodaya),</p>
<p>Is the place with imperceptible characteristics.</p>
<p>Going and coming with the elements,</p>
<p>Mind is always in motion.” {6.1.3}</p>
<p>[The goddess asked], “Why is the word elements being used?” {6.1.4}</p>
<p>The lord replied, “Regarding the secret sixteen syllables, the following has been said:</p>
<p>“The syllable ra is the element of blood.</p>
<p>The ha is the two types of wind.</p>
<p>The sye is said to be phlegm,</p>
<p>And the pa, bile. {6.1.5}</p>
<p>“The following ra is for chyle,</p>
<p>The me, for the two types of fat.</p>
<p>The ra is said to be fire,</p>
<p>And the mye, flesh. {6.1.6}</p>
<p>“The sa is said to be feces,</p>
<p>While the rvā is fatty tissue.</p>
<p>The tma is said to be skin,</p>
<p>And the ni, bone. {6.1.7}</p>
<p>“The sa is said to be urine,</p>
<p>And the dā is thought to be lungs.</p>
<p>The sthi is said to be the lotus,</p>
<p>Moist with wonderful fluid. {6.1.8}</p>
<p>“The ta represents semen,</p>
<p>Which comes from bodhicitta.</p>
<p>This has been explained, goddess,</p>
<p>Based on the natures of the channels and sounds. {6.1.9}</p>
<p>“From the nature of bodhicitta</p>
<p>Comes the embodiment of semen.</p>
<p>The letter ra is said to be body heat;</p>
<p>Bile is produced from blood. {6.1.10}</p>
<p>“Phlegm, which is held to be a singular property,</p>
<p>Produces sweat and tendons.</p>
<p>Wind is said to be their master;</p>
<p>As the syllable ha, it is known to be omnipresent. {6.1.11}</p>
<p>“In the spaces between the bones</p>
<p>Are planted the five seeds.</p>
<p>On the palate is the ra</p>
<p>And everywhere the sublime four syllables. {6.1.12}</p>
<p>“At the location of the first enclosure,</p>
<p>And adorned with the five syllables,</p>
<p>Is the letter ha conjoined with the sixth vowel (ū),</p>
<p>Which is proclaimed to be the syllable of consciousness (hūṁ). {6.1.13}</p>
<p>“By means of the letter ha,</p>
<p>All buddhas everywhere assemble.</p>
<p>From this source, whose nature is sound,</p>
<p>Emerge the objects of the samaya practice. {6.1.14}</p>
<p>“Difficult to come by in the three worlds, this source</p>
<p>Is present at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.</p>
<p>One can connect to it, just like a churning stick is connected to the act of churning,</p>
<p>By means of mantra recitation, meditation, and so forth. {6.1.15}</p>
<p>“Listen to what has been taught in the tantras.</p>
<p>There are two subtle channels inside the womb,</p>
<p>The left and the right. {6.1.16}</p>
<p>“In the left one, the white sexual fluid is known to be present;</p>
<p>In the right one, the blood.</p>
<p>Where they come into contact is</p>
<p>The complete sphere of phenomena. {6.1.17}</p>
<p>“The sattvamprinciple is the body, rajas is speech,</p>
<p>And, according to its nature, tamas is mind.</p>
<p>Sattvam is semen, rajas is blood,</p>
<p>And tamas, foetal development (utpatti). {6.1.18}</p>
<p>“Through the meeting of the vajra and the lotus,</p>
<p>Existence and nonexistence become a single taste.</p>
<p>The experience becomes of a single taste.</p>
<p>Feces, urine, phlegm, blood, and semen as the fifth — {6.1.19}</p>
<p>“The embryo consists of these five ambrosias,</p>
<p>Therefore it is here called vajrin.</p>
<p>Bone, marrow, and semen</p>
<p>Are said to come from the father. {6.1.20}</p>
<p>“Skin, flesh, and blood</p>
<p>Are said to come from the mother.</p>
<p>These six are described as bodily elements</p>
<p>And are joined together in the embryo. {6.1.21}</p>
<p>“A single cell becomes two;</p>
<p>The two become many—</p>
<p>Since it has the nature of both one and many,</p>
<p>It is here called vajrin. {6.1.22}</p>
<p>“In what is described solely in terms of the movement</p>
<p>Through the subtle channels, those channels have two openings.</p>
<p>At the time of their convergence,</p>
<p>One can perceive the deity there. {6.1.23}</p>
<p>“There is the upper opening and the lower one.</p>
<p>Through the lower one courses consciousness,</p>
<p>And through the upper, the elements. {6.1.24}</p>
<p>“The practitioner, having brought together all the channels,</p>
<p>Should visualize it entering.</p>
<p>The vajrin is continuously present</p>
<p>At the upper opening of one’s body. {6.1.25}</p>
<p>“In the upper opening there is a triple mechanism</p>
<p>Surrounded by nine openings.” {6.1.26}</p>
<p>[The goddess asked], “O Blessed One, to what does triple mechanism refer? Why and how is mind always in motion?” {6.1.27}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“There are three mechanisms, hence a triple mechanism,</p>
<p>Established as threefold in terms of its parts.</p>
<p>Having the nature of body, speech, and mind,</p>
<p>There are lesser, middling, and superior functions, respectively. {6.1.28}</p>
<p>“The body has one thick pillar, the ninefold door,</p>
<p>And five presiding deities.</p>
<p>This door is the nine orifices,</p>
<p>Therefore it is proclaimed to be ninefold. {6.1.29}</p>
<p>“The lower opening is that of the body—</p>
<p>It is thick and fashioned by deities.</p>
<p>Because of his mental faculty, a man is exceptional,</p>
<p>Meaning that he is a practitioner. {6.1.30}</p>
<p>“The movement is distinguished by motion,</p>
<p>Regularly, at every moment.</p>
<p>Thus, in the case of monopeds,</p>
<p>Bipeds, and quadrupeds, {6.1.31}</p>
<p>“Movement is always typified</p>
<p>By the types of wind belonging to them.</p>
<p>The wind is fourfold;</p>
<p>The mind’s mode of resting is twofold. {6.1.32}</p>
<p>“Through the process of dissolving and circulating the winds, the resting of dissolving and the motion of circulating will always extend to all beings. He who does not know that is mindless, unexceptional, and unintelligent, meaning that he is not a practitioner. {6.1.33}</p>
<p>“In the southeast, the northeast,</p>
<p>The east, and the west</p>
<p>Are cakras, where mind’s movement</p>
<p>Courses upward, toward the sides, straight, and downward. {6.1.34}</p>
<p>“Following the division between the moon and the sun,</p>
<p>The third opening is that of the mind.</p>
<p>As it involves both entering and exiting,</p>
<p>This is the most exalted opening. {6.1.35}</p>
<p>“It is the main one, the supreme opening,</p>
<p>Said to be directed both upward and downward.</p>
<p>Consciousness moves through the lower opening,</p>
<p>And the elements move through the upper. {6.1.36}</p>
<p>“The five buddhas—Vairocana, and so forth—</p>
<p>Move toward and settle in the upper opening.</p>
<p>They are situated below,</p>
<p>But are requested to depart upward. {6.1.37}</p>
<p>“The mind always moves them</p>
<p>By way of invitation and request to depart.</p>
<p>All the buddhas of the three times</p>
<p>And the ḍākinīs, the mothers of yogins, {6.1.38}</p>
<p>“Activate good and bad qualities</p>
<p>When brought in and expelled,</p>
<p>Their natures thus being pleasure and pain respectively.</p>
<p>As an accomplished being, one will abide in the innate state.” {6.1.39}</p>
<p>So spoke the blessed vajra holder,</p>
<p>Vajrasattva, the great bliss. {6.1.40}</p>
<p>Now, the goddess, having inserted</p>
<p>The lord’s bola into her kakkola,</p>
<p>Gratified the great being</p>
<p>And spoke these words: {6.1.41}</p>
<p>“Why is your name Vasanta (Spring)?</p>
<p>What is the characteristic of Tilakā (Ornament)?</p>
<p>How can there be a place for them</p>
<p>For someone abiding in nonduality, and so forth? {6.1.42}</p>
<p>“Explain to me how Pullīramalaya and the rest</p>
<p>Are said to relate to the distribution of cakras and other entities.</p>
<p>From what do the subtle energy channels emerge?</p>
<p>Tell me what categories these entities fall into.” {6.1.43}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Listen, O goddess. I will now explain the ultimate secret of secrets. {6.1.44}</p>
<p>“The division of pīṭhas and other pilgrimage places, which correspond in their nature to the subtle channels, is said to be twenty-four-fold. They are found within the cakras of the body, speech, and mind of living beings. They are further linked to the ten bodhisattva levels and the ten perfections. {6.1.45}</p>
<p>“The head is the land of Malaya;</p>
<p>The topknot is Jālandhara.</p>
<p>Uḍḍiyāna, for its part,</p>
<p>Is said to be in the right ear. {6.1.46}</p>
<p>“Arbuda is the backbone—</p>

<p>“In these places dwell ḍākinīs</p>
<p>In the form of subtle channels.” {6.1.59}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the sixth chapter.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Now I will explain the cakras of subtle channels according to their location in the body of a tathāgata, one that is present in every being.</p>
<p>“The lotus cakra in the center of the chest</p>
<p>Has eight petals and a pericarp.</p>
<p>The channel located in its center</p>
<p>Has the appearance of the flame of an oil lamp. {6.2.1}</p>
<p>“It extends and faces down,</p>
<p>Like a plantain flower.</p>
<p>At its center dwells the virile one (Heruka),</p>
<p>The size of a mustard seed. {6.2.2}</p>
<p>“He has the form of the indestructible seed syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>Which flows and has the color of snow.</p>
<p>He is called Vasanta because, like spring,</p>
<p>He brings joy to the hearts of embodied beings. {6.2.3}</p>
<p>“Nairātmyā, who has the appearance of vaḍabāgni fire,</p>
<p>Is known as Tilakā.</p>
<p>Fanned by the wind of karma,</p>
<p>She blazes in the navel cakra. {6.2.4}</p>
<p>“Having reached Vasanta, she is gratified,</p>
<p>And becomes established in meditative absorption.</p>
<p>He is the glorious Heruka, the virile one;</p>
<p>He is known as Vasantatilakā. {6.2.5}</p>
<p>“Taking the form of a yoginī,</p>
<p>He is present in the animate and the inanimate.</p>
<p>While the winds emerge through the three types of openings,</p>
<p>According to their division into body, speech, and mind, {6.2.6}</p>
<p>“He enacts the goings and comings.</p>
<p>He dwells in everyone’s body.</p>
<p>In the navel he takes the form of the letter a,</p>
<p>Which is said to be short. {6.2.7}</p>
<p>“In the heart, he abides as the syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>Which is two measures long.</p>
<p>In the throat he has the form of the syllable oṁ,</p>
<p>Which is said to be three measures long. {6.2.8}</p>
<p>“In the forehead he has the form of the syllable haṁ;</p>
<p>He is a sound and an indestructible drop.</p>
<p>According to his distribution between the cakras,</p>
<p>He is the earth and the remaining great elements. {6.2.9}</p>
<p>“Presiding over the four temporal junctures,</p>
<p>He emerges in each of the four lotuses.</p>
<p>Being the essence of the four joys,</p>
<p>He is wholly immersed in the practice of the four yogas. {6.2.10}</p>
<p>“One in nature with the supreme joy,</p>
<p>He assumes the modes of both the action and its agent.</p>
<p>In the form of Vajrasattva</p>
<p>He plays as he pleases in this body. {6.2.11}</p>
<p>“On the four petals in the four directions</p>
<p>Are situated</p>
<p>The subtle channels of the four elements,</p>
<p>Resembling oil lamp flames. {6.2.12}</p>
<p>“In the intermediate quarters</p>
<p>There are four subtle channels that extend to the other four.</p>
<p>They convey the five ambrosias</p>
<p>And assume forms particular to their respective types of worship. {6.2.13}</p>
<p>“As they take on their respective forms</p>
<p>They are described as the four types of worship.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the heart center of the body</p>
<p>Has five subtle channels situated in it. {6.2.14}</p>
<p>“With the division into body, speech, and mind,</p>
<p>There are said to be twenty-four subtle channels.</p>
<p>They are each situated in their particular places,</p>
<p>Following the divisions of pīṭhas, and so forth. {6.2.15}</p>
<p>“The channels that originate in the head</p>
<p>Are known as head-born.</p>
<p>The main ones among them are those</p>
<p>With the natures of rajas, sattvam, and tamas, respectively. {6.2.16}</p>
<p>“The one in Pullīra, called Abhedyā,</p>
<p>Is known to nourish the nails and teeth.</p>
<p>The one in Jālandhara, called Sūkṣmarūpā,</p>
<p>Nourishes the hair of the scalp and the body. {6.2.17}</p>
<p>“The one called Divyā is situated</p>
<p>In the great pīṭha of Uḍḍiyāna;</p>
<p>Located in the right ear,</p>
<p>She nourishes the skin and its hair. {6.2.18}</p>
<p>“In Arbuda, the ḍākinī Vāmā</p>
<p>Nourishes the flesh.</p>
<p>The one that courses through the sinews and tendons</p>

<p>“It is called Vāmanī</p>
<p>And abides in a hard form.</p>
<p>The one in Rāmeśvara</p>
<p>Is commonly known as Kūrmajā; {6.2.20}</p>
<p>“Because of her hard form,</p>
<p>She abides as a bone necklace.</p>
<p>The one in Devīkoṭṭa</p>
<p>Has a soft form, and is called Bhāvikī; {6.2.21}</p>
<p>“She nourishes the heart</p>
<p>And is always present in every living body.</p>
<p>Sekā is in Mālava;</p>
<p>Located in the heart, she is the queen of the victorious ones. {6.2.22}</p>
<p>“The one that nourishes the eyes</p>
<p>Is situated in Kāmarūpa;</p>
<p>It is called Dveṣāvatī</p>
<p>And is claimed to have a visible form. {6.2.23}</p>
<p>“The one in Oḍra carries bile;</p>
<p>She is known as Mahāviṣṭā.</p>
<p>Mātarā, born in Triśakuni,</p>
<p>Is connected with the lungs. {6.2.24}</p>
<p>“The divine Śavarī, who wears a garland of intestines,</p>
<p>Flows through Kośala.</p>
<p>Śītadā is in Kaliṅga;</p>
<p>She flows through the sides. {6.2.25}</p>
<p>“Uṣmā, who resides in the abdomen,</p>
<p>Is the one known [as present] in Lampāka.</p>
<p>Pramāṇā, who resides in Kāñcī,</p>
<p>Always carries the feces. {6.2.26}</p>
<p>“Hṛṣṭavadanā, in Himālaya,</p>
<p>Extends from the center of the body to the extremities.</p>
<p>Svarūpiṇī, located in Pretādhivāsinī,</p>
<p>Carries phlegm. {6.2.27}</p>
<p>“The one that always carries pus</p>
<p>Is located in Gṛhadevatā—</p>
<p>She is called Sāmānyā,</p>
<p>The supreme goddess ḍākinī. {6.2.28}</p>
<p>“The one that flows through Sauraṣṭra</p>
<p>Is called Hetudāyikā and contains blood.</p>
<p>The one that carries sweat</p>

<p>She should go by the name Pāvakī. {6.2.31}</p>
<p>“Sumanā is in Kulatā;</p>
<p>She carries saliva and snot.” {6.2.32}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the sixth chapter on the placement of the sites.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>[The goddess said,] “I would like to hear, O lord, how to perform the worship, and so forth, of the inner maṇḍala. I do not know the procedure for the burnt offering rite. Please explain it, O Great Bliss.” {6.3.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Deities such as the herukas, and so forth,</p>
<p>Exquisitely manifest in the form of the subtle channels.</p>
<p>The body is a delightful maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Which has four gates, as has been described. {6.3.2}</p>
<p>“Its eight pillars being the eight limbs of one’s body,</p>
<p>The maṇḍala is always encircled by them.</p>
<p>Because of the equality among all things,</p>
<p>It is known to be symmetrical, with four sides. {6.3.3}</p>
<p>“Being in essence body, speech, and mind, respectively,</p>
<p>The three cakras are said to be a single one.</p>
<p>On the stamens of the lotus on top of one’s head, which is Mount Meru,</p>
<p>There is Vairambhaka and the other three winds, in their right order. {6.3.4}</p>
<p>“This maṇḍala is present, having manifested</p>
<p>Through the two stages, as handed down by the succession of gurus.</p>
<p>On the soles of the feet there is the Vairambha wind</p>
<p>In the shape of a bow. {6.3.5}</p>
<p>“Located in the triangular area of the abdomen</p>
<p>Is the blazing triangle.</p>
<p>The element of water, in the form of a circle,</p>
<p>Is located in the abdomen. {6.3.6}</p>
<p>“In the heart area there is the earth element,</p>
<p>Symmetrically quadrangular in form.</p>
<p>The spinal column, with the form of a staff,</p>
<p>Is just like Sumeru, the king of mountains. {6.3.7}</p>
<p>“On a lotus with thirty-two petals,</p>
<p>Located in the area of the head,</p>
<p>The vowels and consonants are exquisitely present—</p>
<p>They are claimed to be the thirty-two-fold bodhicitta. {6.3.8}</p>
<p>“That which is in the center of the lotus</p>
<p>Is, for its part, described as a moon disk.</p>
<p>The brain inside the head</p>
<p>Is what is said to be present there. {6.3.9}</p>
<p>“In its center is the syllable hūṁ,</p>
<p>Indestructible, in the form of a drop of ambrosia.</p>
<p>All beings have their foundation in this,</p>
<p>As it is the mainstay of animate and inanimate entities. {6.3.10}</p>
<p>“Their existence is in the form of this seed syllable,</p>
<p>Whether it takes manifest or unmanifest forms.</p>
<p>The forms of all embodied beings</p>
<p>Are therefore complete from the beginning. {6.3.11}</p>
<p>“It is present day and night,</p>
<p>Dripping in the form of ambrosia.</p>
<p>By this ambrosia alone is the ‘sound’ unleashed</p>
<p>And the flame satisfied. {6.3.12}</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala will become filled with it,</p>
<p>There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Only this can be called maṇḍala,</p>
<p>Which is the ultimate essence of all things. {6.3.13}</p>
<p>“Since it gathers this essence,</p>
<p>The maṇḍala is thought to be the body.</p>
<p>The maṇḍala is thus thought to be</p>
<p>The network of thirty-two primary subtle channels. {6.3.14}</p>
<p>“This very maṇḍala is the essence—</p>
<p>The great jewel of bodhicitta.</p>
<p>In its outer and inner aspects,</p>
<p>It is present pervading everything. {6.3.15}</p>
<p>“The outer aspect constitutes the range of engagement</p>
<p>Of all the sense faculties in forms, sounds, and the rest,</p>
<p>While the inner one is present as</p>
<p>The ‘fulfilled’ substances, such as semen, and so forth. {6.3.16}</p>
<p>“By means of these outer and inner aspects</p>
<p>In their coarse and subtle forms, respectively—</p>
<p>Their essence being the bodhicitta of the followers</p>
<p>Of the vajra path in their roles of the world’s kinsmen, {6.3.17}</p>
<p>“The bodhicitta taught in support of the pledge</p>
<p>To become a buddha or a bodhisattva—</p>
<p>Awakening can be attained in this very life,</p>
<p>Thanks to this very maṇḍala. {6.3.18}</p>
<p>“Through this maṇḍala will also come</p>
<p>The final attainments of the hearers,</p>
<p>Solitary buddhas, and gods,</p>
<p>Such as Brahmā, and so forth. {6.3.19}</p>
<p>“One should perform a burnt offering with appropriate substances—</p>
<p>The inner ones, such as semen, and so forth,</p>
<p>And the outer ones, like the aggregate of form and the rest—</p>
<p>Offering them in a blazing fire of insight. {6.3.20}</p>
<p>“Based on the specificities of the six sense-fields,</p>
<p>The elements, the aggregates, and so forth,</p>
<p>They have the nature of deities,</p>
<p>And likewise, ḍākinīs. {6.3.21}</p>
<p>“The inner worship (yogapūjā) is said to consist of these,</p>
<p>For they are offered by the practitioner in worship.</p>
<p>The skull of one’s own head</p>
<p>Is said to be the vessel for burnt offerings. {6.3.22}</p>
<p>“Rasanā (the right channel) is said to be the sacrificial sruva ladle;</p>
<p>Lalanā (the left channel), at the heart cakra, has the nature of the sruk ladle;</p>
<p>The mouth is averred to be the sacrificial plate,</p>
<p>While the sacrificial fire pit is located in the hollow of the navel. {6.3.23}</p>
<p>“The brahmanical fire, fanned by activating winds,</p>
<p>Is located at the triangle of the abdomen.</p>
<p>The sound of the winds is said to be the mantra,</p>
<p>While their cycling is the repetition. {6.3.24}</p>
<p>“The appearances in such meditation</p>
<p>Reflect the practice of the nondual maṇḍala.</p>
<p>Mounted upon the innate nature, this is, accordingly,</p>
<p>The maṇḍala, and so forth, of the victorious ones. {6.3.25}</p>
<p>“The teacher is the sovereign mind,</p>
<p>According to his nature of being the lord of the maṇḍala.</p>
<p>He should therefore understand everything in this tantra</p>
<p>Just as explained, starting from ‘Thus.’ ” {6.3.26}</p>
<p>[The goddess said:]</p>
<p>“I am still unclear how the lord sports in the forms</p>
<p>Of dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya, and great bliss.</p>
<p>I do not know the categories.</p>
<p>Please tell me, O Great Bliss.” {6.3.27}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“The two cakras located at the head and at the navel</p>
<p>Each contain the shape of the letter e.</p>
<p>Those, on the other hand, that are in the heart and the throat</p>
<p>Bear a semblance to the syllable vaṁ. {6.3.28}</p>
<p>“The cakra located at the navel</p>
<p>Is a lotus with sixty-four petals.</p>
<p>The one inside the head</p>
<p>Is a lotus with thirty-two petals. {6.3.29}</p>
<p>“The one inside the neck</p>
<p>Is a lotus with sixteen petals,</p>
<p>And the one in the heart</p>
<p>Is known to be a lotus with eight petals. {6.3.30}</p>
<p>“The nirmāṇakāya is said to be</p>
<p>In the one with sixty-four petals,</p>
<p>Whereas the dharmakāya abides</p>
<p>In the lotus with eight great petals. {6.3.31}</p>
<p>“The sambhogakāya abides in the lotus with sixteen petals,</p>
<p>Whereas in the one with thirty-two petals,</p>
<p>Great bliss, as great gnosis,</p>
<p>Is situated throughout. {6.3.32}</p>
<p>“In the center of the nirmāṇa cakra there is,</p>
<p>Surrounded by the eight classes of letters,</p>
<p>That supreme syllable—the letter a—</p>
<p>Which occupies the foremost position among all letters. {6.3.33}</p>
<p>“In the cakra of the dharmakāya</p>
<p>There is the celebrated syllable hūṁ, thought to be indestructible.</p>
<p>It appears in combination with five vowels,</p>
<p>And is adorned with ya, ra, la, and va. {6.3.34}</p>
<p>“In the center of the sambhoga cakra</p>
<p>There is the syllable oṁ, which illuminates all letters.</p>
<p>It is surrounded on all sides</p>
<p>By sixteen letters in sets of four. {6.3.35}</p>
<p>“In the exalted cakra of great bliss</p>
<p>Is the syllable haṁ in the form of a drop.</p>
<p>The sun and the moon are said to be</p>
<p>On its left and right sides respectively. {6.3.36}</p>
<p>“In its section starting from the throat</p>
<p>And ending at the center of the navel,</p>
<p>The left channel (lalanā), associated with the sambhogakāya,</p>
<p>Flows downward and carries semen. {6.3.37}</p>
<p>“The subtle channel that flows upward (rasanā),</p>
<p>In its section starting from the navel</p>
<p>And ending at the center of the neck,</p>
<p>Is said to carry blood. {6.3.38}</p>
<p>“Semen is called moon;</p>
<p>Blood is known as sun.</p>
<p>Mounted upon the two openings,</p>
<p>They are situated below and above respectively. {6.3.39}</p>
<p>“For these two, the moon and the sun,</p>
<p>Are known as the duo of subtle channels</p>
<p>That cause the going and the coming</p>
<p>Of the virile ones and the ḍākinīs. {6.3.40}</p>
<p>“Their meaning is that of setting and rising,</p>
<p>Similar to falling asleep and waking again.</p>
<p>On the left and the right sides</p>
<p>There are a dozen vowels. {6.3.41}</p>
<p>“They are said to be facing upward</p>
<p>And are surrounded by the syllables ka, kā, and so forth.</p>
<p>The vowels are joined with these downward-facing consonants,</p>
<p>Which have been moved from the sides to the center. {6.3.42}</p>
<p>“The syllable kṣa, which is called rākṣasa,</p>
<p>Is situated in the lower region of the body.</p>
<p>When the moon (bodhicitta) is present in the throat cakra</p>
<p>In its mode of intense passion, {6.3.43}</p>
<p>“It is then called sambhogakāya,</p>
<p>The supreme body of buddhas.</p>
<p>It is so called also when it is at the tip of the [lotus] protuberance,</p>
<p>Having reached the tip of the vajra. {6.3.44}</p>
<p>“When the sambhogakāya</p>
<p>Has reached the end of its path</p>
<p>And fallen into the bhaga,</p>
<p>It is known as mustard seed. {6.3.45}</p>
<p>“It is then said to have the nature of the sun</p>
<p>And is called nirmāṇakāya.</p>
<p>It is by way of this nirmāṇakāya</p>
<p>That the manifestation of buddhas and bodhisattvas are born. {6.3.46}</p>
<p>“In that setting sun,</p>
<p>In the form of nirmāṇakāya,</p>
<p>Resides the king Padmanarteśvara,</p>
<p>In union with the lotus which was caused to open its petals. {6.3.47}</p>
<p>“When that, which is then called perfect bodhicitta,</p>
<p>Becomes the pure embryonic lump,</p>
<p>It is cut off from the paths of cyclic existence</p>
<p>And is the auspicious state of the cessation of conceptual thinking. {6.3.48}</p>
<p>“Nondual and ultimately pure,</p>
<p>It is the nature of glorious Vajrasattva</p>
<p>Called glorious Heruka,</p>
<p>Present in the tantras as a worm. {6.3.49}</p>
<p>“He is established in the three tantras</p>
<p>As a burst of laughter, a glance, or a handshake, respectively.</p>
<p>He abides as a worm,</p>
<p>Consuming both passion and dispassion.” {6.3.50}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the sixth chapter on the subtle channel conjunctions which constitute the concealed essence of the ḍākinīs’ net.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>Then the great bodhisattvas, headed by Vajragarbha, with the yoginī Nairātmyā, and so forth, among them, spoke thus:</p>
<p>“Please teach us the way to meditate</p>
<p>On the circle of deities according to the order of their arising</p>
<p>And, in particular, the special circle of ḍākinīs</p>
<p>And their secret code-language, {6.4.1}</p>
<p>“As well as the concealed essence, which you mentioned before.” {6.4.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“The concealed essence is located in the center</p>
<p>Of the yoginī’s body in the form of the letter a.</p>
<p>That secret essence is said to be the same</p>
<p>In both its external and internal forms. {6.4.3}</p>
<p>“The pleasure derived from the bola is the mahāmudrā;</p>
<p>The abode of the vajra is the means.</p>
<p>The external coupling is explained</p>
<p>As this secret combination. {6.4.4}</p>
<p>“The three bodies are said to reside within the body</p>
<p>In the form of the three cakras.</p>
<p>The cakra of great bliss is understood</p>
<p>In terms of fully cognizing the three bodies. {6.4.5}</p>
<p>“There is dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya,</p>
<p>As well as the body of great bliss.</p>
<p>The three bodies are situated</p>
<p>Within the womb, the heart, and the throat. {6.4.6}</p>
<p>“Wherever any beings</p>
<p>Are said to come into existence,</p>
<p>There is the creation of the nirmāṇakāya,</p>
<p>For this creation is constant and broad. {6.4.7}</p>
<p>“Phenomena are the nature of mind</p>
<p>And the body of phenomena (dharmakāya) is in the heart.</p>
<p>The sambhogakāya is said to be</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the six types of flavors. {6.4.8}</p>
<p>“As it is firmly rooted in all phenomena,</p>
<p>Everything has its nature.</p>
<p>The sambhogakāya cakra is in the neck,</p>
<p>While the cakra of great bliss is in the head. {6.4.9}</p>
<p>“The result corresponding to its cause is in the syllables e-vaṁ;</p>
<p>The fully matured result is in the cakra of the dharmakāya;</p>
<p>The result consisting of valiant effort is in the cakra of the sambhogakāya;</p>
<p>And the stainless result is in the cakra of great bliss. {6.4.10}</p>
<p>“The result is said to be fourfold,</p>
<p>Following the division of the result corresponding with its cause, and the rest.</p>
<p>The partaker in karmic results is the lady Wisdom herself,</p>
<p>When she is stirred by the karmic winds. {6.4.11}</p>
<p>“The Sthāvarī division (nikāya) of the canon is in the cakra of nirmāṇakāya,</p>
<p>Since the nirmāṇa creation is constant and enduring (sthāvara).</p>
<p>The Sarvāstivāda school is in the cakra of dharmakāya,</p>
<p>For the doctrine (dharma) is born from speech (vāda). {6.4.12}</p>
<p>“The Saṃvidī school is in the cakra of the sambhogakāya,</p>
<p>For experiencing (saṃvid) is based in the throat.</p>
<p>The Mahāsāṃghika school is in the cakra of great bliss,</p>
<p>For the great bliss is located in the head. {6.4.13}</p>
<p>“The mother’s body is said to be the congregation of monks;</p>
<p>The mother’s belly is the monastery.</p>
<p>Inside the womb, the embryo is the renunciant;</p>
<p>The embryo’s membrane is the flame-colored robe. {6.4.14}</p>
<p>“One’s mother is one’s teacher;</p>
<p>Folding one’s hands at the head is the salutation.</p>
<p>Worldly activity is the abiding by rules of conduct;</p>
<p>The sound of breathing (a-ham) is the mantra recitation. {6.4.15}</p>
<p>“In this way a monk is born—muttering this mantra,</p>
<p>Naked, and with bald head and face.</p>
<p>With such attributes, there is no doubt</p>
<p>That all beings are buddhas. {6.4.16}</p>
<p>“The ten months of pregnancy are the ten stages,</p>
<p>And the beings in the womb are the lords of the ten stages.</p>
<p>Referred to by the name semen, a buddha is implanted</p>
<p>In the bhaga of a queen, which is the realm of Sukhāvatī. {6.4.17}</p>
<p>“Without him—the semen—there would be no bliss,</p>
<p>And without bliss, he—the semen—would not arise.</p>
<p>So, since these two are ineffective without each other,</p>
<p>In the case of impotence, the bliss can be generated through deity yoga. {6.4.18}</p>
<p>“Consequently, buddhas are neither entities,</p>
<p>Nor are they non-entities.</p>
<p>They possess a form with arms and face,</p>
<p>But in terms of the ultimate bliss, they are formless. {6.4.19}</p>
<p>“Therefore, all beings are the innate condition;</p>
<p>The innate condition is said to be their very nature.</p>
<p>With the mind in a purified form,</p>
<p>This nature is nirvāṇa. {6.4.20}</p>
<p>“Union with the form of the deity</p>
<p>Is established as soon as one is born</p>
<p>Based on having a face, hands, color, and shape,</p>
<p>But including also base predispositions from the past. {6.4.21}</p>
<p>“In this way, O goddess, is explained the usurpassable among all unions.”</p>
<p>Then all the goddesses, headed by Nairātmyā, including Locanā, Māmakī, Pāṇḍaravāsinī, Tārā, Bhṛkuṭī, Cundā, Parṇaśavarī, Ahomukhā and Śaṃvarī—yoginīs as numerous as the dust particles on Mount Sumeru—became utterly bewildered, fainting and trembling. {6.4.22}</p>
<p>At that moment, all the tathāgatas, headed by Akṣobhya, said this: “May the Blessed One please resuscitate all the hosts of yoginīs.” {6.4.23}</p>
<p>Then, having entered the meditative absorption called the “vajra conquering all ignorance,” the lord revived all the yoginīs and said: {6.4.24}</p>
<p>“Sentient beings are buddhas,</p>
<p>But they are sullied by adventitious defilements.</p>
<p>When these defilements are removed, they become buddhas.</p>
<p>This is so, O Blessed One and other sons of noble family. {6.4.25}</p>
<p>“If an ordinary man were to eat poison in ignorance</p>
<p>He would fall unconscious.</p>
<p>But if he were free from delusion,</p>
<p>Then knowing the truth would neutralize his affliction. {6.4.26}</p>
<p>“One who knows the true nature of poison</p>
<p>Can overcome poison with poison,</p>
<p>Using a potion that would kill</p>
<p>All other creatures. {6.4.27}</p>
<p>“Similarly, someone afflicted by flatulence</p>
<p>Is given a dish of beans,</p>
<p>For flatulence is killed by flatulence</p>
<p>After administering a medicine that seems counterproductive. {6.4.28}</p>
<p>“Conditioned existence is purified by conditioned existence,</p>
<p>And concepts are removed by concepts.</p>
<p>Just as water that has gotten inside the ear</p>
<p>Is extracted with more water, {6.4.29}</p>
<p>“So too are concepts about entities</p>
<p>Purified with entity-forms of the deity.</p>
<p>Just as those who have been burned by fire</p>
<p>Apply fire once more as a sudorific, {6.4.30}</p>
<p>“So too those burned by the fire of passions</p>
<p>Apply the sudorific of the fire of passion.</p>
<p>Any savage act that binds</p>
<p>Its perpetrator by karma {6.4.31}</p>
<p>“Can, in and of itself, when conjoined with skillful means,</p>
<p>Release him from the fetters of conditioned existence.</p>
<p>People are bound by passion,</p>
<p>And only by passion are they released. {6.4.32}</p>
<p>“This inverted meditation</p>
<p>Is unknown to orthodox Buddhists or tīrthikas.</p>
<p>In sexual play there are five types of enjoyment</p>
<p>Corresponding to the five elements. {6.4.33}</p>
<p>“What is a single great delight</p>
<p>Becomes fivefold when the categories are applied.</p>
<p>The solidity (earth element) is experienced</p>
<p>Through the touch felt when bola and kakkola unite. {6.4.34}</p>
<p>“Because the solidity has the quality of delusion,</p>
<p>Delusion is regarded as Vairocana.</p>
<p>Since bodhicitta is liquid,</p>
<p>This liquid is regarded as the water element. {6.4.35}</p>
<p>“Since water has the nature of Akṣobhya,</p>
<p>Hatred is the guide Akṣobhya.</p>
<p>When the two organs are united in mutual rubbing</p>
<p>Heat is always born. {6.4.36}</p>
<p>“This heat of passion is the vajra state of Amitābha,</p>
<p>For passion is born within heat.</p>
<p>The semen-consciousness deposited in the kakkola</p>
<p>Has the nature of wind. {6.4.37}</p>
<p>“This movement of envy is Amoghasiddhi,</p>
<p>For Amogha is born from wind.</p>
<p>Pleasure is the impassioned mind—</p>
<p>The jewel with the characteristics of space. {6.4.38}</p>
<p>“Space is the vajra quality of backbiting,</p>
<p>For backbiting is born from space.</p>
<p>The one great semen-consciousness</p>
<p>Is thus characterized by these five aspects. {6.4.39}</p>
<p>“Arisen within the five families,</p>
<p>They are multiplied therein by the thousand.</p>
<p>Still, their nature is but single—</p>
<p>The unending, ultimate bliss. {6.4.40}</p>
<p>“This bliss, however, becomes fivefold according to the division</p>
<p>Into the five mental states of passion, and so forth. {6.4.41}</p>
<p>“Within each of the five families there are multitudes of tathāgatas,</p>
<p>Equal in number to the grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers.</p>
<p>Within each of these great families there are many families,</p>
<p>And within each of these families there are many hundreds more families. {6.4.42}</p>
<p>“These too are big, containing hundreds of thousands of families,</p>
<p>Which have tens of millions, which in turn become innumerable.</p>
<p>Within each of these families there are further innumerable families—</p>
<p>All of them arise from the family of the supreme joy.”</p>
<p>So spoke [Vajrasattva]. {6.4.43}</p>
<p>[The goddess asked,] “How can all this be contained in the form of a globule the size of a particle?” {6.4.44}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“It is so because many buddhas can fit in the space of a hair’s width,</p>
<p>Without crowding or causing inconvenience to one another. {6.4.45}</p>
<p>“Rise, rise, O deities, replete with the ten powers,</p>
<p>Who wish to feast in my house,</p>
<p>And you, sons of the buddha families, who appear through your miraculous powers. {6.4.46}</p>
<p>“Listen, O goddess, as I will now teach</p>
<p>The characteristics of the emergence from sampuṭa. {6.4.47}</p>
<p>“The word rahasye abides in the element earth;</p>
<p>Parame, in the element water;</p>
<p>Ramye, in the element called fire;</p>
<p>And sarvātmani abides in wind. {6.4.48}</p>
<p>“The phrase sadā sthitaḥ expresses</p>
<p>The saṃvara identity of all buddhas,</p>
<p>Always present in the form of mirror-like wisdom,</p>
<p>The wisdom of equality, {6.4.49}</p>
<p>“The wisdom of clear discrimination,</p>
<p>Or the wisdom accomplishing all actions.</p>
<p>The phrase sadā sthitaḥ thus conveys</p>
<p>The nature of impeccable purity. {6.4.50}</p>
<p>“It is thus always present as Vairocana.</p>
<p>When it is always present as Amoghasiddhi,</p>
<p>It could be in the form of Ratnasaṃbhava,</p>
<p>Or perhaps Amitābha. {6.4.51}</p>
<p>“It is a drop made of the five ambrosias,</p>
<p>Consisting in its nature purely of mind.</p>
<p>It is also pristine great gnosis,</p>
<p>The nature of all female deities. {6.4.52}</p>
<p>“It is called Vajrasattva</p>
<p>And is declared to be the ultimate bliss.</p>
<p>Its self-existing nature, however,</p>
<p>Is known as the dharmakāya. {6.4.53}</p>
<p>“This Vajrasattva possesses innate wisdom, Prajñā,</p>
<p>Established by her nature as part of him.</p>
<p>She is fanned by the activating winds</p>
<p>And blazes in the area of the navel. {6.4.54}</p>
<p>“She is called Nairātmyā,</p>
<p>Also known as Vasantatilakā.</p>
<p>Her body consists of hundreds of thousands of points of light</p>
<p>As dazzling as a massive flash of lightning. {6.4.55}</p>
<p>“During deity yoga practice, however,</p>
<p>These points of light come out</p>
<p>Through the pores of one’s skin into the ten directions,</p>
<p>Threatening all the gods and demigods. {6.4.56}</p>
<p>“Having blazed in the dharmakāya cakra at the chest,</p>
<p>The rays of light reach the cakra of the sambhogakāya.</p>
<p>They then exit through the right nostril,</p>
<p>Radiating all around. {6.4.57}</p>
<p>“Coming out also through the opening located at one’s crown,</p>
<p>The light rays radiate throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>Entering the buddhas and bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Through their left nostrils. {6.4.58}</p>
<p>“The light rays then enter the cakra at the top of their heads;</p>
<p>Having set their cakra ablaze with light,</p>
<p>[Nairātmyā] should withdraw and re-enter the practitioner</p>
<p>Through the previously mentioned opening at the crown. {6.4.59}</p>
<p>“While all the buddhas are being burned up,</p>
<p>She will cause bliss to arise.</p>
<p>Finally, having returned to the area of the navel,</p>
<p>She will abide there as before.” {6.4.60}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign chapter called Vasantatilakā, the sixth in the great tantra, the “Emergence from Sampuṭa.”</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>[Vajragarbha said:]</p>
<p>“I want to hear, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>The description of secret code words.</p>
<p>What can be said about this twilight language?</p>
<p>Please speak conclusively, O Blessed One, {7.1.1}</p>
<p>“About this great pledge of the yoginīs</p>
<p>That cannot be deciphered by the hearers and others.</p>
<p>With the smiling, glancing,</p>
<p>Embracing, coupling, and so forth, {7.1.2}</p>
<p>“This twilight language has not been taught</p>
<p>Even in the four divisions of tantra.”</p>
<p>[The Blessed One said:]</p>
<p>“I will teach it, Vajragarbha;</p>
<p>Please listen with undivided attention. {7.1.3}</p>
<p>“The great language called twilight language</p>

<p>And olibanum means ‘union of the two sexual organs.’ {7.1.8}</p>
<p>“Vajra is said to mean ‘male sexual organ,’</p>
<p>And lotus, ‘female sexual organ.’ {7.1.9}</p>
<p>“Placing the finger on the mouth</p>
<p>Is the sign of Ḍākinī. The code word is muku.</p>

<p>Is the sign of Dīpinī. The code word is ghoghu. {7.1.10}</p>

<p>Is the sign of Kambojī. The code word is mughu. {7.1.11}</p>
<p>“Tapping on the tip of one’s nose with the palm of the hand,</p>
<p>One will inquire about a person’s well-being. The code word is lughu.</p>
<p>The practitioner of Yogatantra should also display the ‘head of a deer,’</p>
<p>Giving to this hand gesture his full attention. The code word for this is draṣṭa. {7.1.12}</p>
<p>“Further, the word ḍā denotes a man;</p>

<p>“These, which are code words with a single syllable each, will be understood by the virile ones and their sisters. This is the art of the pledge seals consisting of syllables.” {7.1.14}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“I do not know the meanings of some coded expressions.</p>
<p>Please explain them, O Great Bliss.” {7.1.15}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“I will now teach it briefly,</p>
<p>So please listen to my words.</p>
<p>Potāṅgī is a greeting;</p>
<p>Potāṅgī given in response is a greeting returned. {7.1.16}</p>

<p>go, an ox;</p>
<p>ma, a buffalo;</p>
<p>bhā, eating anywhere;</p>
<p>and hā, a recurrence.</p>

<p>“This concludes the section about the art of secret signs.</p>
<p>“The gaze that brings downfall is said</p>
<p>To always be even, with eyebrows furrowed in anger.</p>
<p>The enthralling gaze should be directed to the left,</p>
<p>With both eyes looking at the effigy on the left side. {7.1.19}</p>
<p>“In the summoning gaze, the effigy is on the right</p>
<p>And the two eyes turned upward.</p>
<p>The paralyzing gaze is directed toward the center,</p>
<p>With the two eyes directed at the bridge of the nose. {7.1.20}</p>
<p>“For killing, the gaze should be level,</p>
<p>With the two eyes fixed at the tip of the nose.</p>
<p>Causing downfall should be done while exhaling,</p>
<p>And enthralling while holding the breath in. {7.1.21}</p>
<p>“Summoning is done while inhaling,</p>
<p>And paralyzing while holding the breath in.</p>
<p>While training, the gaze causing downfall should be directed at a pine tree,</p>
<p>And the enthralling gaze, at a flower. {7.1.22}</p>
<p>“The summoning gaze should be directed at a euphorbia,</p>
<p>And the paralyzing gaze, at grass that is swaying.</p>
<p>One will succeed after six months of practice,</p>
<p>There is no doubt about this. {7.1.23}</p>
<p>“One should not err in this practice.</p>
<p>The powers of the Buddha are inconceivable. {7.1.24}</p>
<p>“The homage is paid and returned with the two ‘teachers’ present. {7.1.25}</p>
<p>“If one employs the deity yoga of the glorious Vajrasattva or others and frowns with the right eyebrow, one will be successful, upon contemplating sky-travel, in rising into the air. If one frowns with the left eyebrow, victory over a hostile army will follow. With the same practice one will crush the forces of Māra. {7.1.26}</p>
<p>“If one contemplates the form of Gaurī or other female deities and bats one’s left eye, one will be able to manifest their forms. If one contemplates the form of Vajrasattva or other male deities and bats one’s right eye, one will manifest their respective forms. {7.1.27}</p>
<p>“Without an agreed convention of language, not even the well-established worldly usages would have any effect. The same is the case with the yogic accomplishments in poetry and song, both mundane and supramundane. {7.1.28}</p>
<p>“This concludes the section about the art of gaze-mudrās.</p>
<p>“Assuming the form and shape of glorious Vajrasattva</p>
<p>Consistent with being fully in union with him,</p>
<p>One should place, as directed,</p>
<p>Some mustard seeds in a human skull cup. {7.1.29}</p>
<p>“Additionally, he should eat a dish cooked in oil,</p>
<p>And smear the head with the fruits.</p>
<p>This affords the best of all protections</p>
<p>By binding earth and sky up to their farthest limits in the ten directions. {7.1.30}</p>
<p>“Visualizing oneself as one with glorious Vajrasattva,</p>
<p>Biting his lower lip and in union with his consort—</p>
<p>The illustrious one proudly holding implements in his left hands</p>
<p>And, with his right hands, displaying the circuit of the compass— {7.1.31}</p>
<p>“One should consecrate the space below and above</p>
<p>And stamp one’s ‘seal’ on the earth and the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Sealed, it becomes composed of all the buddhas</p>
<p>And will confer accomplishments. {7.1.32}</p>
<p>“One should place the following in a bowl made of a brahmin’s skull or, as one’s second choice, any human skull. Aside from [a skull] of a woman, a man, a hermaphrodite, and so forth, [a skull] of a crow, an owl, a vulture, or a sparrow will produce various excellent accomplishments. The procedure prescribes wild licorice root. Through this, one will be able to assume at will the fine form of an elephant or a horse, or, according to one’s wish, the form of an ox or a buffalo, or, should one wish it so, a dog, a cat, or a jackal. Depending on one’s wish, one can be a male or a female. {7.1.33}</p>
<p>“One can enter any being by censing oneself with black bdellium resin burned inside the mouth cavity of a corpse, with the fire from a cremation pyre, on the day of spirits, during the waning period of the lunar month. By censing oneself as before with a mixture of equal parts thorn apple fruit, yellow arsenic, citrons, leadwort, sweet flag, and chicken eggs, one can enter anywhere in the animate or inanimate worlds. {7.1.34}</p>
<p>“The root of white oleander, margosa, and grasshoppers, combined with a hundredth part of the venom from a scorpion’s stinger, will, when applied to the hand, transform it into a gonāsa snake. {7.1.35}</p>
<p>“For seven days one should douse velvet bean pods and soak chalk with the milk from giant milkweed. When a drawing made with this chalk and velvet bean mixture is touched, one will become like the king of serpents, with poisonous hands. An antidote to the touch of these hands is explained as follows: {7.1.36}</p>
<p>“Sandal, mesua flower, costus root, and emetic nut, combined with Indian valerian, neutralize a variety of poisons. So does costus mixed with rice water. Should one consume a pill consisting of the pith of Indian valerian, together with the feces of a child born on that day, one will be able to drink poison as much as one likes, like Vajrapāṇi himself. {7.1.37}</p>
<p>“A touch from a hand smeared with a broth made with the fat of a frog and an earth boa snake, and with the fruit of sebesten tree, will remove poison. {7.1.38}</p>
<p>“An ointment made from ghee, sandal, peacock blood, and the bones and flesh of an earth boa snake, when applied to the body, can detoxify even the entire triple universe upon contact. {7.1.39}</p>
<p>“The fever that recurs every four days will be cured if, while concentrating by means of the ritual procedure of getting naked, and the rest, one fastens to the hand on the day of spirits a root of fragrant swamp mellow broken into seven pieces. {7.1.40}</p>
<p>“By merely applying an incense composed of equal parts of newly shed skin from a large snake and peacock feathers, one will create enmity throughout the triple universe. {7.1.41}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, by merely burning an incense, according to procedure, composed of equal parts crow and owl feathers, one will actually cause enmity even among the supporters of Hara. {7.1.42}</p>
<p>“When the head of a snake placed inside the hole of a horse’s hoof is buried together with the tongue of a mad dog underneath the door of the enemy’s house, he will be driven away after seven days. {7.1.43}</p>
<p>“Flame lily, pig feces, hair from the head of a corpse, and bones of a camel—this excellent method will send into exile, after seven days, even the entire triple universe. {7.1.44}</p>
<p>“By smearing on a mirror flowers of red oleander, cashew nut, and mangosteen oil, the shapes of a horse, a donkey, a camel, and so forth, will be seen in it. {7.1.45}</p>
<p>“Through burning in a sealed duplex vessel the hooves and claws of a horse, a cow, a boar, a monkey, an ass, and a camel, mixed with frog fat, the forms of those creatures will be seen, as stipulated earlier. After anointing the eyes, during the asterism of Puṣya, with alangium seed oil and cow’s milk, one will perceive in the mirror any forms present within the universe. {7.1.46}</p>
<p>“A person whose eyes are anointed with a paste of Indian valerian fruit and alangium oil will see ordinary people as divine forms. Through anointing his eyes with oil his vision will go back to normal. {7.1.47}</p>
<p>“After anointing the feet with camphor, powdered leech, frog fat, and root of the trumpet flower tree, one will be able to walk upon a heap of smoldering embers. {7.1.48}</p>
<p>“After smearing the hands and the feet with spikenard, frog fat, powdered leech, and cardamom, one will be able to make fire feel as cold as snow. {7.1.49}</p>
<p>“After taking blood of a water snake into one’s mouth, the wise person will be able to enter water and remain there as long as he likes, as if inside a floating house. {7.1.50}</p>
<p>“Should he put on a pair of shoes, having filled them with seeds of the broken bones plant, a person thus purified will be able to walk on water as if on a road. {7.1.51}</p>
<p>“A wise person, after smearing all the orifices of his body with a paste made of freshly churned butter, gold dust, onion, and fish oil, will be able to move in water like an alligator. {7.1.52}</p>
<p>“Seeds from a branch of thorn apple mixed with wood dust produced by woodworms, together with female cuckoo birds, will make a person like a ghost. This can be reversed by means of a molasses and rice gruel mixture. {7.1.53}</p>
<p>“Feathers of a bird; hair of a cat, a monkey, and an outcast; feathers of an owl; and hair of a mongoose, when powdered and mixed with carama dung, can make all people go insane. {7.1.54}</p>
<p>“The tail of a jackal, rightly conjoined with the right wing of a crow, when placed under the enemy’s bed will soon unleash upon him a terrifying apasmāra. {7.1.55}</p>
<p>“With thorn apple fruit, citron, and the [droppings of] pigeon, peacock, and chicken, one can instantly cause madness. The insanity will go away with the cutting of the victim’s hair. {7.1.56}</p>
<p>“One should take a thorn apple fruit and mix into it powdered woodworms with human flesh. After adding this to the victim’s food and drink, he will immediately lose his mind and die after seven days. {7.1.57}</p>
<p>“One should take a crow’s nest from a neem tree with a hand on which white mustard oil has been rubbed. Using the same hand, one should burn it together with a piece of wood obtained from a charnel ground and afterward retrieve the ashes. Whoever’s head is sprinkled with these ashes will be driven away. {7.1.58}</p>
<p>“One should combine the feather of a crow and an owl, together with the hair of a brahmin and a naked mendicant, and light a fire using thorn apple wood. After burning these feathers and hair in a smokeless fire, one should retrieve some of the ashes and secretly throw them under the bed of two persons, men or women. Right at that moment the two will become enemies. {7.1.59}</p>
<p>“This concludes the section on the art of manipulating consciousness.</p>
<p>“Alternatively, if one wishes to enthrall someone, one should make a powder of a bee that has stung a white bitch in the chest. When struck with it, even a woman loyal to her husband will be enthralled, if one mixes this powder with one’s own semen during the asterism of Puṣya. {7.1.60}</p>
<p>“Placing in the hand of a virgin girl equal amounts of elephant rut and a paste from buds plucked by women from male trees will result in marriage and conjugal felicity. {7.1.61}</p>
<p>“Indian valerian, Indian caper, and purple fleabane, blended with teardrops and one’s own semen, will enthrall a playful woman right away. {7.1.62}</p>
<p>“A powder containing puttaṃjārī,apannā, Indian caper, and purple fleabane, when mixed with teardrops, enthralls the women in this world upon contact alone. {7.1.63}</p>
<p>“Dwarf morning glory, littoral bind weed, lakṣaṇā, and avanatā, when infused with eye discharge and teardrops, instantly enthrall even the charming wife of the lord of gods. {7.1.64}</p>
<p>“The root of the white giant milkweed, Indian madder, house sparrow, and costus, when made into a paste with exudations from a wound on one’s body, will enthrall the triple universe. {7.1.65}</p>
<p>“One should prepare a mixture of basil, Indian caper, and kṣīrādhikā with one’s own semen. A pill made of this and cutch tree, served with betel, will instantly enthrall even the charming wife of Śiva. {7.1.66}</p>
<p>“One should make a powder from a nose rope that had tethered a buffalo, ash from a corpse cremated using thorn apple wood, and a bracelet from a dead woman who was burned in a funeral pyre extinguished with thorn apple juice. When mixed with one’s own semen, this will instantly enthrall even the daughter of Indra just upon contact. {7.1.67}</p>
<p>“This concludes the section on the art of making others into one’s subjects.</p>
<p>“A tilaka on the forehead made with Malabar gulbel, fireflies, arsenic, bovine orpiment, and realgar will instantly enthrall. {7.1.68}</p>
<p>“After placing on one’s forehead a tilaka of yellow orpiment together with white dūrvā grass and wild dūrvā grass, one will be able to enthrall a king with a mere glance. {7.1.69}</p>
<p>“Malabar gulbel, fireflies, avanatā, camphor, and Indian caper, made into powder with an admixture of teardrops, will instantly enthrall the charming wife of a king. {7.1.70}</p>
<p>“When a woman is struck with a preparation made of flowers from the corpse of a newly married man, noon flowers collected from the head of a worshiped śivaliṅga, and ash, in equal measure, from the funeral pyres of a cremated husband and wife, mixed together with one’s semen, she will follow behind the one who struck her. {7.1.71}</p>
<p>“Dwarf morning glory, fireflies, lakṣaṇā, and Indian caper, mixed with a powder made of intestinal worms with an admixture of teardrops, will produce enthrallment instantly. {7.1.72}</p>
<p>“Sweet flag and white moonseed mixed with an equal part of kurchi and the umbilical cord of a newborn calf—when a beautiful woman comes into contact with these ingredients in the form of a tilaka on the forehead, she will become enthralled. {7.1.73}</p>
<p>“One will enthrall the people of the world with a tilaka well concocted from ‘glory sandalwood,’ red sandalwood, and camphor, infused with equal parts of the blood of a wagtail and a female mule. {7.1.74}</p>
<p>“In the asterism of Puṣya one should, using a boar’s tooth, grind seeds of common sesban and seeds of white butterfly pea together with bovine orpiment, and make a tilaka with them on one’s forehead. If one were to look at a mighty king while wearing this tilaka, he would not be angry, but would definitely be pleased. {7.1.75}</p>
<p>“This concludes the section on the art of tilaka and its benefits.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, if one wishes to make a magical pill, one should grind the impurities and the eyes of a black cat and the eyes of a black crow together with the blood from the left ear of a black boar. The pill, which should also include an authentic relic of the tathāgatas, should then be wrapped in the aforementioned concoction, and then enclosed in ‘sun,’ ‘moon,’ and ‘fire.’ In the asterism of Puṣya, the pill should be activated. One will be successful by reciting the mantra of one’s chosen deity. When the pill is placed in the mouth, one can roam the earth assuming, like a yakṣa, any desired form. {7.1.76}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, one should make a pill with the eyes of a black pecikā owl, black crow, black ullūka owl, and black cuckoo, combined with an authentic relic of the tathāgatas. One should cover the pill in the milky sap of Indian spurge tree and wrap it in ‘sun,’ ‘moon,’ and ‘fire.’ When this pill is placed in the mouth, one becomes invisible. {7.1.77}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, in order to produce a pill consisting of a relic of the tathāgatas, one should grind together the ashes from the funeral pyre of a woman cremated with her deceased husband, powdered fruit of wood apple, and resin of white dammar, along with perspiration. An authentic relic of the tathāgatas should be wrapped in this concoction and enclosed in ‘sun,’ ‘moon,’ and ‘fire.’ The pill should be activated during the asterism of Puṣya. When it is placed in the mouth, one will be able to roam the earth like a yakṣa, assuming any desired form. {7.1.78}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, one should make a pill with an eye ointment called srotaḥ, camphor, spiky leaves of saffron crocus, honey, and the first blossom of the mahua tree, with added stamens of a young flame lily. This pill, encased within the three metals of gold, silver, and copper, will make one invisible. {7.1.79}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, in a capsule made of the three metals of gold, silver, and copper should be placed sprouts of a blue aśoka tree inuncted seven times with the blood of a beautiful woman. Placing it in the mouth will conceal any being. {7.1.80}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, a pill made of the northern root of Indian valerian, dug out during a lunar eclipse while naked, should be encased in the metals of ‘sun,’ ‘moon,’ and ‘fire.’ If placed in the mouth, this pill will make one invisible. {7.1.81}</p>
<p>“A pill made from bovine orpiment and blossoms from the Indian almond tree, combined with the eyes and hair left behind by a crow who fed on the corpse of a girl who hung herself, is called ‘the lady who fulfills wishes.’ {7.1.82}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, one should mix realgar with the discharge from rubbing a girl maddened by menstruation in an ancestor grove. By applying a tilaka of this to the declivity in the center of one’s forehead, one will be able to hide from even the entire triple universe. {7.1.83}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, applying to the forehead a tilaka prepared with the twigs from a crow’s nest located on a northern branch of a blue aśoka tree will hide a man from all animate and inanimate beings. If srotaḥ eye ointment is placed in the abdomen of a pigeon, put in the fire of a funeral pyre, and cooked, the magical ointment will make one invisible. Re-appearance can be achieved by means of the blood of a black cat. {7.1.84}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, earth pushed up by a tuft of young grass and mixed with a bee, along with its stinger, can make one invisible even to the adepts if it is prepared on the asterism of Puṣya, and a tilaka of it is applied to the forehead. {7.1.85}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, there is a pill superior even to that. Made with red arsenic and bovine orpiment, its effects surpass the uses explained before. {7.1.86}</p>
<p>“This concludes the section on the art of becoming invisible.</p>
<p>“Now I will describe the rites involving magical ointment.</p>
<p>“One should make a lamp-wick out of cloth recovered from a charnel ground and saturate it with oil obtained from human flesh. On the night of spirits, in the charnel ground, one should place the lighted lamp on a lotus petal [inside a woman’s skull] atop three other human skulls, and collect the lampblack that collects above, in the delightful lady’s skull. Then, after burning up an owl’s head and mixing it with red sandalwood many times, one should, that very night, prepare from this a fine powder by grinding it on a stone slab. One should then blend this powder with the earlier collected lampblack until the mixture is homogeneous, wrap that in the skin from a vulture’s foot, and with it fill the hollow of a bone from this foot using a splinter from a human bone. Explaining how to activate this ointment, the lord said, ‘It can be activated inside a woman’s bhaga, by a follower of the Mantrayāna, according to prescribed procedure.’ {7.1.87}</p>
<p>“This is the art of concocting magical ointment.</p>
<p>“Now I will teach the rites</p>
<p>Known as the ritual procedure of quicksilver,</p>
<p>Whereby practitioners attain success</p>
<p>If they always delight in meditation and recitation. {7.1.88}</p>
<p>“If the procedure is not complete,</p>
<p>Happiness cannot be brought to wretched beings. {7.1.89}</p>
<p>“One should combine substances that come from mountains and oceans with well-matured vinegar and quicksilver, and grind them together repeatedly in a sealed and heated stone crucible. One should always boil this concoction in a copper dish along with common milk hedge, butterfly pea, jasmine, and Indian caper, combined with fermented rice. Taking a metal [magnet], one should mix in its powder, and along with parts of safflower and large blue lotus, grind it with the vinegar concoction until it becomes the same consistency as freshly churned butter. Immediately thereafter, one should mix it with the sap of Indian spurge tree, and liquify it with sindhu and white borax. Then, it should be mixed together with half a karṣa each of copper and silver in a covered crucible, adding half the amount of sulphur crystals. From this, one will obtain gold measuring half the amount of the substrate. {7.1.90}</p>
<p>“This is about the art of quicksilver.</p>
<p>“Now I will teach the rites of the art of longevity, giving an essential summary of everything. {7.1.91}</p>
<p>“Following the ritual restrictions with respect to seasons, one should practice yoga and mudrā. One should employ the ‘four ingredients,’ musk, red sandalwood, camphor, and śālija, and also olibanum, tailed pepper, and lotus seeds. These great drugs are especially powerful during six different time periods. {7.1.92}</p>
<p>“There is spring, hot season,</p>
<p>And rainy season.</p>
<p>There is also autumn, early winter,</p>
<p>And the snowy late winter too. {7.1.93}</p>
<p>“In springtime, the wise one should perform the rite in the morning;</p>
<p>During the hot season, at midday;</p>
<p>During the rainy season, in the afternoon;</p>
<p>In the autumn, after dark; {7.1.94}</p>
<p>“In early winter, at midnight;</p>
<p>And in late snowy winter, before dawn.</p>
<p>This practice, as done by those observing the right time,</p>
<p>Is now being taught to you, O beautiful-faced one. {7.1.95}</p>
<p>“Midnight is right for ingesting the flower infusion (menstrual blood);</p>
<p>The season recommended for this is early winter.</p>
<p>In the spring, though, the “four ingredients” (feces)</p>
<p>Will bring accomplishment if ingested in the morning. {7.1.96}</p>
<p>“During the rainy season, in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Musk (urine) is pleasing to the mind.</p>
<p>During the hot season, at midday,</p>
<p>Lotus seeds will bring the fulfillment of all one’s aims. {7.1.97}</p>
<p>“In the autumn, after dark,</p>
<p>Lotus sap (vaginal secretion?) brings the desired accomplishment.</p>
<p>In late winter, before dawn,</p>
<p>Camphor (semen) is particularly recommended. {7.1.98}</p>
<p>“This supreme practice is the best.</p>
<p>One who does it with a collected mind</p>
<p>Will become free from old age and death,</p>
<p>There is no doubt about this. {7.1.99}</p>
<p>“Quicksilver and sulphur,</p>
<p>In combination with śekhara,</p>
<p>Blended homogenously with ghee,</p>
<p>Should be employed in every rite. {7.1.100}</p>
<p>“One should procure the fourteen substances</p>
<p>And zealously ingest them in nine different ways.</p>
<p>One should perform this rite according to one’s wishes,</p>
<p>Following the divisions of lunar and solar cycles. {7.1.101}</p>
<p>“One will attain full results within twenty-one days. Lost teeth, fingernails, and hair will grow back. When one is accomplished, one will be able to change all elements into gold. {7.1.102}</p>
<p>“Now I will teach a rite involving oil.</p>
<p>“Oil of lotus, oil of vālā, and oil from the “four ingredients” should all be combined with an equal amount of ground black turmeric, and mixed with the juice of country mallow. One should also prepare an extract from moonseed and mix it with cow’s milk.</p>
<p>“Now I will give you the measurements. One should prepare thirty-two palas of the black turmeric and moonseed powder and boil it with twice that amount of water until it is reduced to four cups of liquid. One should mix this three times, according to the proper sequence, with three parts of the juice of country mallow. One should blend this with four parts of milk to one part of oil, half that amount of moonseed, half that amount of sediment, and the previously mentioned ingredients, cooking it all together gently. When the mixture is going to be drunk, which requires a medium amount, the moonseed should be left out. For anointing the head, which is said to require a thicker consistency, cooking it three more times is said to be best. For an errhine one should use ten palas. For drinking, one hundred palas is recommended. When anointing, one should use one hundred and eight palas. The practitioner should perform all this with a focused mind. By applying an errhine of this, he can live for a thousand years. When drinking it, he can live five hundred years. When anointing the head, he can live three hundred years. My words are not to be doubted. He will obtain a divine form and a pleasant voice, will always be adored, and will definitely reach proficiency in all sciences and disciplines. His body will have great splendor and luminosity. He will be able to remove all obstacles. {7.1.103}</p>
<p>“He should procure the ‘four ingredients,’ dry them well, and blend them thoroughly with milk. He should heat this mixture up in a cow dung fire until the ingredients dissolve, then obtain from it the oil. The practitioner should blend this oil with twice as much black sesame oil and again twice as much milk, and cook it as prescribed. A decoction made of four parts thorn apple, the three fruits, false daisy, common jasmine, and grass is regarded as helpful for promoting growth. {7.1.104}</p>
<p>“Black turmeric, black babchi, blue lotus bulb, iron filings, sulphur, bdellium, white dammar, camphor, and musk—he should cook these substances in oil. They will promote health and longevity. If they are rubbed on the head, they will remove grey hair and wrinkles. All diseases will depart, without a doubt. {7.1.105}</p>
<p>“Now I will teach the rite of preparing oils for rubbing on the body.</p>
<p>“One should use the same oil, but add myrrh, thorn apple tree, Indian caper, and fragrant swamp mallow. Mixing in chaste tree berries, the practitioner of mantra should prepare this into a solution through the previously described method. This should then be mixed with black creeper, beautyberry, ironwood, bulletwood tree, golden champa, red poon, fetid cassia, turmeric, thorn apple, cockscomb, agarwood tree, asafoetida,parahṛd, vallabhī,mukta, pongam oil tree, mañjari, thorn apple tree, sweet flag, babchi, nut grass, black turmeric, Indian madder, costus, and veronicalolia—these will remove all illnesses. {7.1.106}</p>
<p>“An incense of both white and red sandalwood, deer musk, camphor, Indian olibanum, and fingernails, mixed with molasses, can fulfill all one’s wishes. One will be able to cure itching, rash, and cutaneous eruptions, and remove all toxins produced in the body. My words are true, O goddess, there can be no doubt. {7.1.107}</p>
<p>“Turmeric powder, chaste tree berries, powder from a temple brick, extract of thorn apple leaves, musk, and the “four ingredients,” when combined with caura and keṁśu, can destroy many different diseases, such as intestinal worms, leprosy, and the toxins in the body. It is especially effective when applied together with babchi. {7.1.108}</p>
<p>“These are the ritual procedures for anointing the body with medicinal unguents.</p>
<p>“One should pulverize the three astringent substances together with the ‘four ingredients’ and drink this with cold musk for one year while observing vows. In this way one will be able to cure a variety of illnesses related to the internal organs, such as diseases of phlegm, and so forth. When this elixir is digested, it will without fail remove grey hair, and so forth, from the practitioner of mantra. {7.1.109}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should procure the four ingredients and grind them into a fine powder together with the three fruits. Then he should blend them with ghee and honey and eat one karṣa of this preparation. Consequently, he will become divinely beautiful and live three hundred years. {7.1.110}</p>
<p>“Now comes the same recipe, still in liquid form, but without ghee or honey. Alternatively, he should procure the three astringent substances and grind them into a fine powder, gradually adding one cat’s paw of musk from the midriff. If the practitioner drinks it well cooled, imagining that power is his, it will cure flatulence and indigestion and, in time, remove wrinkles and grey hair. If it is warm, however, it will cause the greying of hair. {7.1.111}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should procure the three fruits, cook them with milk and water, and apply the concoction to the head. {7.1.112}</p>
<p>“He should grind root of long pepper with red rice. He should then make pills out of this, cook them with ghee, and eat them with honey. Then, after three months, all diseases will depart, and especially grey hair. After a six-month treatment, the practitioner will obtain a pleasant voice and become well nourished. After nine months, he will obtain a divine body, become quick-witted, and be able to retain what he hears. After one year, he will obtain the strength of an elephant and be able to live three hundred years. {7.1.113}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should procure three parts each of nāga root, palāśa root, and costus root. He should grind them into powder with one part long pepper as the tenth part of the concoction. After blending the powder with cow milk, a wise yogin should consume one karṣa of this mixture every day. {7.1.114}</p>
<p>“Should a yogin dwell in desolate mountains, and such,</p>
<p>For hundreds of years,</p>
<p>He will surely be totally satiated</p>
<p>And free of hunger and thirst. {7.1.115}</p>
<p>“Thus, he should dwell in desolate mountains, and such,</p>
<p>With this remedy.</p>
<p>Any other method is unnecessary,</p>
<p>As far as the attainment of buddhahood is concerned. {7.1.116}</p>
<p>“He should meditate without company in a mountain cave—the hermitage of the relative truth of practitioners. {7.1.117}</p>
<p>“One who wants to be a practitioner</p>
<p>But does not know the ritual restrictions with respect to seasons</p>
<p>Is like someone hitting his fist against empty space</p>
<p>Or drinking mirage water,</p>
<p>Or like a hungry person threshing chaff. {7.1.118}</p>
<p>“Futile will be their toil;</p>
<p>It will bear no fruit.</p>
<p>The practitioner should thus stay focused</p>
<p>According to the ritual procedure revealed by me. {7.1.119}</p>
<p>“This is the section on the science of longevity called ‘the source of all knowledge.’ ”</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the seventh chapter.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>[Vajragarbha said:]</p>
<p>“I want to hear, O Blessed One, how to perform</p>
<p>The ritual of homa with its recitation, and so forth.</p>
<p>How should one do the rites of pacifying, enriching, enthralling, and assaulting,</p>
<p>Along with their respective oblation offerings, and so forth?” {7.2.1}</p>
<p>[The Blessed One replied:]</p>
<p>“Hear, Vajragarbha, the description of the rites</p>
<p>Of homa, and so forth, as they actually are.</p>
<p>First, the practitioner of mantra should do one hundred thousand recitations of the mantra,</p>
<p>And after, start the performance of the rite. {7.2.2}</p>
<p>“A deity yoga practitioner,</p>
<p>Having assumed the āliḍha posture, the pratyāliḍha posture,</p>
<p>Or one with the feet parallel, or forked,</p>
<p>Should invite his consort (vidyā) to join him. {7.2.3}</p>
<p>“She could be a brahmin, a kṣatriya,</p>
<p>A vaiśya, or a śūdra—</p>
<p>So require the rules of the rite.</p>
<p>Afterward, he should commence the homa rite. {7.2.4}</p>
<p>“If it is the rite of pacifying, he should delimit a round fire-pit area one cubit in diameter. Having done the measurements, he should dig a hole half a cubit deep in the ground. He should daub the insides of this half-cubit-deep pit with white sandalwood. He should demarcate a four-finger-width wide rim of earth in a circle surrounding the fire pit. {7.2.5}</p>
<p>“The pit for enriching should be a square of two cubits on each side. The basin should be one cubit deep. The rim should be eight finger-widths wide. The pit should be bedecked with heaps of yellow flowers and anointed with yellow sandalwood. {7.2.6}</p>
<p>“The pit for the rites of assaulting should be triangular and measure twenty finger-widths across. The basin should be ten finger-widths deep. He should draw the rim three finger-widths wide and smear the pit with charnel ground ash. {7.2.7}</p>
<p>“Since the activities of enthralling and summoning are similar, their pit is described as having identical characteristics. One should prepare a pit shaped like a half-moon and with the same measurements as the pit for enriching. The depth of the basin should be half its diameter. One should demarcate the rim to fit the other measurements and daub the pit with red sandalwood. {7.2.8}</p>
<p>“The powder used for demarcating the pit</p>
<p>Should be white in rites of pacifying,</p>
<p>Yellow in rites of enriching, black in rites of killing,</p>
<p>And red in rites of enthralling. {7.2.9}</p>
<p>“The specifications for summoning are the same as those for enthralling,</p>
<p>And those for sowing hatred, the same as those for killing. {7.2.10}</p>
<p>“Now I will explain the connection between the types of rites and the directions.</p>
<p>“The fire pit for pacifying should be to the east of the temple or maṇḍala,</p>
<p>That for the rites of assaulting to the south,</p>
<p>The one for enthralling and summoning to the west,</p>
<p>And the one for enriching to the north. {7.2.11}</p>
<p>“The marking powder is said to correspond in color to the rites just described. This concludes how one should dig the fire pits. {7.2.12}</p>
<p>“Now I will explain the procedure involving different types of grain.</p>
<p>“He should mix rice, corn, white sesame, barley, nutmeg, dūrvā grass, milk, ghee, and honey with the five ambrosias and offer this in a homa along with moist wood branches originating from the five sap-bearing trees, still with leaves on them, smeared at both ends in honey, milk, and ghee. He should start the fire with the kindling of Indian cluster fig and palash tree. If he wants to perform the rite of pacifying, he should cast the offerings into the fire one hundred and eight times, three times a day, while sitting facing east. He can then pacify even the entire district. {7.2.13}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wants to perform the rite of enriching, he should procure black sesame and mung beans along with red rice. As an alternative, he can use barley or something else. The kindling sticks are said to be the same as before, but this time they should be smeared with one handful of milk and butter. All the ingredients should be sprinkled with saffron perfume and combined with the three sweet things, rice pudding, curds, honey, ghee, dill, bel fruit, lotus, stamens of ironwood blossoms, and rice. Having then lit the fire using wood of Indian cluster fig, he should generate himself as the deity appropriate for the ritual. Facing north, he should cast the ingredients into the fire a thousand times, three times a day, with a focused mind. When seven days have passed, he will become a great owner of wealth. {7.2.14}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wants to perform the rite of enthralling, he should procure red sesame or black sesame, beautyberry, stamens of ironwood blossoms, champak, sorrow-less tree, vajra, bulletwood tree, bāṇa, and dill, mixed with sandalwood, ghee, and honey. He should also procure pieces of wood eight finger-widths long from deodar, banyan, pipal, Indian cluster fig, and other trees. Also, the milky sap from the Indian olibanum and guggul trees, as well as sugandha and other substances, should be used. Then, he should assume a red form using menstrual blood mixed with vajra water and sit facing the west. Whoever’s name he employs while making offerings to the fire will become enthralled after seven days. He will be able to keep her or him for as long as he lives. {7.2.15}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wishes to perform the rite of assaulting, he should blend black sesame, mung beans or something similar, the fruit of the marking nut, and kālaka, with black mustard oil and an admixture of blood. He should then procure thorns from a crooked black tree, and pieces of wood ten finger-widths long from all trees that are pungent, bitter, and so forth. Adding human bone, human feces, donkey droppings, and hair, as well as dog feces, hair, and paws, he should blend all this with oil, and facing south with a focused mind, offer it into a charnel ground fire one hundred and eight times. Whoever’s name one employs will die within three days.</p>
<p>“If not, he should stand to one side and prepare a triangular fire pit. There, he should offer the previously mentioned substances into a fire obtained from a household of untouchables. By this means alone the enemy will be led to the abode of the lord of death, of this there is no doubt. {7.2.16}</p>
<p>“If he wants to drive someone away, he should mix mustard seeds, mung beans, and dust from a footpath, and blend them with blood and black mustard oil. He should add to this a crow’s nest from a thorn apple tree. The person whose name he employs while offering this preparation into the fire will be driven away instantly. {7.2.17}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should use crow meat and camel droppings mixed with wine. Naked and with loose hair, he should offer this into a fire from a charnel ground. Whoever’s name he employs will be driven away. {7.2.18}</p>
<p>“If he wants to perform paralyzing, he should grind fish, meat, and the remaining three substances, together with rice grains, blood, and honey, and add to this a crow’s feather. He should offer this into a fire made with sticks from a crow’s nest and discarded sticks for cleaning teeth, in a square fire pit. Whoever’s name he employs will be stopped from carrying out any task. {7.2.19}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should use turmeric, (arsenic) orpiment, realgar, and bovine orpiment. He should offer this into the fire while facing north. Whoever’s name he employs will become paralyzed. {7.2.20}</p>
<p>“If he employs dog and chicken meat, he should grind them together with camel droppings and cat blood. Then, lighting the sacrificial fire using neem tree sticks, he should offer this into the fire. Whichever village’s name he employs will be destroyed. {7.2.21}</p>
<p>“He should blend spirituous liquor with human flesh and offer it into the fire, at the three junctions of the day, until he has done this one hundred and eight times. After six months he will become the governor of the district. {7.2.22}</p>
<p>“He should offer one hundred burnt offerings of jackal meat. After three months he will be able to remove dire poverty in an instant. {7.2.23}</p>
<p>“He should soak cow flesh in cow blood and offer it one thousand times into a fire. Enthrallment will take place, lasting as long as he lives, there is no doubt. {7.2.24}</p>
<p>“He should blend the same meat with spirituous liquor and offer it into a fire with his left hand. He will be able to enthrall even a buddha, let alone ordinary people. If not, he can also use a stick for cleaning the teeth, covered in saliva, smeared with bodily impurities, and doused with wine. By offering this stick as a burnt offering he will enthrall the target, there is no doubt. {7.2.25}</p>
<p>“By offering ingested and vomited menstrual blood with an addition of human hair as a burnt offering, he will be able to summon the target immediately. This method of summoning is the best. {7.2.26}</p>
<p>“He should smear crow’s feathers with white mustard oil and offer them in a thorn apple fire. Whoever’s name he employs will immediately be driven away and die. {7.2.27}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire an oblation of atimuktikā, white gourd melon, mung beans, sann hemp, vomit, and black mustard, together with tamāla leaves, at home. He will be able to seal the target’s mouth, there is no doubt. {7.2.28}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire an oblation of dog meat combined with vajra water. Whoever’s name he employs will become enthralled within seven days. {7.2.29}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire horse meat together with human feces at night. He will be able to enthrall the king within seven days. {7.2.30}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire elephant meat mixed with semen. He will be able to enthrall an entire city. {7.2.31}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire fish and meat combined with spirituous liquor. When he has offered this one hundred and eight times, he will be able to enthrall any woman. {7.2.32}</p>
<p>“He should offer in a fire only crow meat one thousand times. Whoever’s name he employs will flee within three days. If even Vajrasattva will flee, how much more so will ordinary people? {7.2.33}</p>
<p>“He should offer crow and hawk meat into a fire made with thorn apple sticks. Whoever’s name he employs will be driven away. {7.2.34}</p>
<p>“He should offer human flesh and bird meat. Whoever’s name he employs will go insane. Should he offer the same into a chaff fire, the target will become well again. {7.2.35}</p>
<p>“All these rites can only be performed by someone</p>
<p>Who has done preliminary practices.</p>
<p>Otherwise he will become without a doubt</p>
<p>An object of ridicule of all the people. {7.2.36}</p>
<p>“He must not disclose the secret of his practice to anyone. If the secret is revealed, he will never gain accomplishment or find happiness. Therefore a mantra practitioner must never perform these rites in front of anyone. If he wants to perform them, he should do so alone. Then the mantra practitioner can succeed in every rite.” {7.2.37}</p>
<p>This concludes the section on homa rites, which forms the second part of the seventh chapter.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>[The goddess said:]</p>
<p>“It would be interesting to hear, my lord,</p>
<p>About the methods of deriving mantras.</p>
<p>I do not know their categorization.</p>
<p>Please explain this, O Great Bliss.” {7.3.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Listen Great Wisdom, my lady!</p>
<p>I will tell you the mantras of the deities.</p>
<p>In the pleasant maṇḍala with three corners</p>
<p>Is the secret lotus, Māmakī. {7.3.2}</p>
<p>“One should form an eight-petaled lotus</p>
<p>With its pericarp located in the secret area.</p>
<p>There, one should reproduce the valiant one in syllables</p>
<p>That fulfill all one’s aims and wishes. {7.3.3}</p>
<p>“Based on the divisions of the letters of the alphabet,</p>
<p>Beginning with the letter a, mantra is the supreme lord of letter classes. {7.3.4}</p>
<p>“Take the second letter of the first group, surmounted by a dot; the third letter of the seventh group, adorned with a half moon; and the seed syllable of awakening, ‘worshiped’ on its crown by the full moon. This is the heart mantra. {7.3.5}</p>
<p>“Now I will give you the auxiliary heart mantra. One should take the second letter of the seventh group (ra), join it with Vajraḍākinī (u), and double it. Then, one should take the third letter of the hot sounds (sa) and support it underneath with the second letter of the sixth group (pha), joined with the fifth vowel (u). The second of the semivowels (ra) should be supported underneath by the fifth vowel (u). The third letter of the third group (ja) should be supported underneath by the twenty-ninth letter (va). The third letter of the seventh group (la) and the first letter of the fifth group (ta) should be joined with the third vowel (i). The second letter of the eighth group (ṣa) should be supported underneath by the twelfth letter (ṭha). One should take the thirty-second letter (sa) and join it with Gaurī (i). Then, one should add the third letter of the fifth group (da) with the fourth letter from that same group (dha) below it. One should add the third semivowel (la), supremely adorned by Ghasmarī (o). One should join to the first letter of the third group (ca) and the fifth letter of the fifth group (na), Caurī (e), who is the highest boon. {7.3.6}</p>
<p>“Locanā is the creator of peace for the buddhas.</p>
<p>She makes all rites successful,</p>
<p>She is said to revive the dead,</p>
<p>And she is the requester of the vajra pledge.” {7.3.7}</p>
<p>And the Blessed One added, “Oṁ, svāhā to Vajravairocanī. {7.3.8}</p>
<p>“The fourth letter of the second group (gha) adorned with Vāri is the heart mantra of Māmakī. Her auxiliary heart mantra is explained as follows:</p>
<p>“The first letter of the hot sounds (śa) is adorned above by Khecarī (aṁ). The first letter of the second group (ka) and the second letter of the seventh group (ra) are joined with Caurī (e) in like fashion. The first letter of the eighth group (śa) should be joined by the supreme Vajrā (a), who is the highest boon. One should take the twentieth letter (na) and support it underneath with the sixteenth letter (ta). Gaurī (i) is held to be their adornment. One should take the first letter of the second group (ka) and the twenty-seventh letter (ra), and one should join them with Caurī (e). The fourth letter of the second group (gha), with Vajraḍākinī (u) as its seat, should be combined with the first letter of the third group (ṭa), then doubled. The fourth letter of the second group (gha) should be joined with Vajraḍākinī (u). Take the eleventh letter (ṭa), distinguished by the third vowel (i), add the fifth letter of the fifth group (na), and join it with Gaurī (i). One should take the fourth letter of the second group (gha), along with the supreme essence of Vajrā (a), then add the sixteenth letter (ta) and the twenty-sixth letter (ya), and double the whole thing. The fourth letter of the second group (gha) should be adorned with the fifth vowel (u).</p>
<p>“The first letter of the fourth group (ṭa)</p>
<p>Should be joined with Gaurī (i).</p>
<p>The fifth letter of the fifth group (na)</p>
<p>One should join with Gaurī (i). {7.3.9}</p>
<p>“In the protective vajra rites,</p>
<p>She (Māmakī) invariably accomplishes all actions.</p>
<p>She is declared to be the strength-giver</p>
<p>To those afflicted by the great vajra fear.” {7.3.10}</p>
<p>Now the Blessed One said the mantra of Māmakī’s consort Ratnasambhava:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, burn, burn, hūṁ, phaṭ! Svāhā to [the deities who shout] phaṭ!” {7.3.11}</p>
<p>[And he continued further:]</p>
<p>“Now, for the mantra of Paṇḍaravāsinī, one should take the first letter of the second group (ka) and the first letter of the fourth group (ṭa); Caurī (e) is thought to be their adornment. One should take the fourth letter of the seventh group (va), adorned on top with Gaurī (i). One should then take the first letter of the second group (ka) and the eleventh letter (ṭa), adorned on top with Caurī (e). One should take the fifth letter of the fifth group (na) and join it with the third vowel (i). One should take the first letter of the second group (ka) and the first letter of the fourth group (ṭa), and connect to them Caurī (e), who is the supreme boon. One should then add the first letter of the second group (ka) and the first letter of the fourth group (ṭa), adorned on top with Khecarī (aṁ). One should add the first letter of the second group (ka) and the eleventh letter (ṭa), joined with Caurī (e). {7.3.12}</p>
<p>“Mahākoṣavatī always generates energy,</p>
<p>Which fosters the Dharma</p>
<p>Merely by reciting the mantra,</p>
<p>Similar to the words of Vāgvajra. {7.3.13}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vajradharma hrīḥ! Svāhā! {7.3.14}</p>
<p>“Now, for the mantra of Tārā, one should take the sixteenth letter (ta),</p>
<p>With Vajrī (ā) as the supreme adornment,</p>
<p>And the second semivowel (ra),</p>
<p>With Caurī (e) joined to it. {7.3.15}</p>
<p>“One should take the first letter of the fifth group (ta),</p>
<p>With Ḍākinī (u) thought to be its seat.</p>
<p>One should then take the sixteenth letter (ta),</p>
<p>With the first letter of the fifth group (ta) as its seat, and Vajrā (ā) joined with it. {7.3.16}</p>
<p>“One should take the twenty-seventh letter (ra)</p>
<p>In combination with Caurī (e).</p>
<p>To this should be added the first letter of the fifth group (ta)</p>
<p>Joined with Ḍākinī (ā) below. {7.3.17}</p>
<p>“The second letter of the seventh group (ra)</p>
<p>Should be augmented by the essence of Caurī (e).</p>
<p>The great army of Buddhavajra,</p>
<p>And the realm of beings all around, {7.3.18}</p>
<p>“Will carry out any orders like servants;</p>
<p>They will surely be enthralled right at that time.” {7.3.19}</p>
<p>So spoke the great Blessed Vajradhara.</p>
<p>“One should derive a mantra beginning with</p>
<p>The syllable oṁ that illuminates everything, and ending with svāhā.</p>
<p>Such a mantra will grant all desired accomplishments,</p>
<p>Just like the words of the Tathāgata. {7.3.20}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, act, act! Accomplish, accomplish! Bind, bind! Frighten, frighten! Shake, shake! Hraḥ hraḥ! Pheṃ pheṃ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Burn, burn! Cook, cook! Devour, devour! You who wear a garland of entrails covered in fat and blood, seize seize! Threaten the serpents in the seven subterranean paradises. Summon them, summon! Hrīṁ hrīṁ! Jñaiṁ jñaiṁ! Kṣmāṁ kṣmāṁ! Hāṁ hāṁ! Hīṁ hīṁ!Hūṁ hūṁ! Kili kili! Sili sili! Cili cili!Dhili dhili! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā!</p>
<p>This mantra of the lord of spells accomplishes all activities. {7.3.21}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Akṣobhya:</p>
<p>“To start, one should take the syllable of Vairocana (oṁ),</p>
<p>And then take the fourth letter of the ‘hot sounds’ (ha),</p>
<p>Adorned with Pukkasī (ū) and topped with ‘empty space’ (ṁ).</p>
<p>One should append svāhā at the end. {7.3.22}</p>
<p>“By reciting this mantra 100,000 times</p>
<p>One will be able to paralyze the world at any time. {7.3.23}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Ratnasambhava:</p>
<p>“At the beginning one should take the king of letters (oṁ),</p>
<p>And after that, Khecarī (laṁ).</p>
<p>One should add svāhā at the end—</p>
<p>With this one will be able to enthrall even the buddhas. {7.3.24}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Amoghasiddhi:</p>
<p>“One should take the first letter of the Vedas (oṁ) and the second letter of the second group (kha) topped with ‘empty space’ (ṁ), and add svāhā at the end. The wise practitioner will be able to drive away even the buddhas. {7.3.25}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Amitābha:</p>
<p>“At the beginning one should place the syllable of Vairocana (oṁ) and combine it with the third letter of the third group (ja), adorned with the neuter syllable (ra) and Vāri (ī), together with ‘empty space’ (ṁ). The mantra should end with svāhā. When pronounced, it sows enmity. {7.3.26}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Vairocana:</p>
<p>“At the beginning one should place the king of letters (oṁ). Then, one should take the fourth letter of the seventh group (va), joined with the syllable of Vajraḍākinī (u) and ‘empty space’ (ṁ). One should add svāhā at the end. This mantra is employed in acts of assaulting. {7.3.27}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Locanā:</p>
<p>“One should again use the king of letters (oṁ), then add the red syllable hūṁ, and finish with svāhā. With this mantra one will be able to summon the entire world, and among the apsarases, Rambhā, and so forth, and even Tilottamā. {7.3.28}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Māmakī:</p>
<p>“At the beginning one should place the syllable of the ‘delusion family’ (oṁ),</p>
<p>And join it with the syllable ghuḥ.</p>
<p>At the end, one should again add svāhā—</p>
<p>With this one will be able to cause the death of gods and men. {7.3.29}</p>
<p>“The heart mantra of Paṇḍaravāsinī:</p>
<p>“One should take the second letter in the eighth group (ra), adorned with the eighth letter of the eighth group (ha). One should place the syllable of the ‘delusion family’ (oṁ) at the beginning and complete it with svāhā at the end. {7.3.30}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Tārā:</p>
<p>“One should take the syllable of action (ī) and join it with the syllable of Vairocana (oṁ) at the beginning, and with svāhā at the end. {7.3.31}</p>
<p>“The heart mantras for the surrounding gate keepers</p>
<p>Are the four neuter vowel syllables (ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ);</p>
<p>The remaining vowels constitute the mantras for the eight offering goddesses.</p>
<p>Starting with the first syllable of the Vedas (oṁ),</p>
<p>One should pronounce the mantra with svāhā at the end. {7.3.32}</p>
<p>“The offering goddesses Puṣpā, Dhūpā, Gandhā,</p>
<p>And also Dīpā,</p>
<p>Vaṃśā, Vīṇā,</p>
<p>Mukundā and Murajā, {7.3.33}</p>
<p>“As prescribed by the rule, should thus be arranged</p>
<p>As in the maṇḍala for the gaṇacakra feast. {7.3.34}</p>
<p>“Now I will teach on Tārā’s many boons,</p>
<p>Variously manifesting through each ritual action.</p>
<p>“The first method;</p>
<p>“One should draw a lotus with four petals</p>
<p>Extending throughout the cardinal and intermediate directions. {7.3.35}</p>
<p>“Its pericarp should be decorated, as prescribed,</p>
<p>With three taṁ syllables.</p>
<p>Around, following the shape of a circle,</p>
<p>The mantrin should write as follows: {7.3.36}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Prasannatārā! One with the face and eyes of an immortal! Fulfiller of all aims! Pacifier of all beings! Please bring about enthrallment, no matter whether it is of a woman, a man, or a king! Svāhā! {7.3.37}</p>
<p>“In the center of the lotus he should draw a wheel with eight spokes, furnished with eight syllables. On its hub should be drawn the first letter of the fifth group (ta) adorned with the crescent moon and the bindu (tam̐). Then, he should surround it with the mantra in the shape of a garland, ending with svāhā, and with syllables hrīḥ placed on the anthers in the spaces in between. The mantrin who thus forms two wheels joined as prescribed will be able within seven days to enthrall even a king. {7.3.38}</p>
<p>“The second method;</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should draw a wheel with ten spokes, which houses a lotus</p>
<p>Furnished at its center with the ten syllables of the mantric formula.</p>
<p>The target’s name should be written on the pericarp within the mantra.</p>
<p>He will enthrall the target for as long as she or he lives, there is no doubt. {7.3.39}</p>
<p>“The third method;</p>
<p>“He should draw another yantra-wheel with six spokes,</p>
<p>Containing the six syllables of the mantric formula,</p>
<p>And write in the center ‘hrīḥ, please enthrall, hrīḥ,’</p>
<p>Adding the word svāhā at the end. {7.3.40}</p>
<p>“Whoever writes this mantra on birchbark</p>
<p>With bovine orpiment mixed with lac,</p>
<p>Red sandalwood, and one’s own blood,</p>
<p>And wears it on his body, {7.3.41}</p>
<p>“Will enthrall even gods and other such beings,</p>
<p>Let alone ordinary people. {7.3.42}</p>
<p>“The fourth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw in the center of a water disk</p>
<p>A three-pronged, crossed vajra scepter.</p>
<p>He should place the name</p>
<p>Of the target in its hub. {7.3.43}</p>
<p>“Should he draw this in chalk, according to procedure,</p>
<p>In a pair of earthenware vessels, he will paralyze the target. {7.3.44}</p>
<p>“The fifth method;</p>
<p>“There can also be a yantra-wheel with eight spokes, depicted entirely as a lotus with its petals. He should place upon it the syllables interspersed with the syllable gaḥ following the right procedure. The pericarp of the lotus should be adorned with eight gaḥ syllables. In the center he should write gaḥ svāhā gaḥ, combining this with the name of the target. He should write this on a stone slab with the juice of turmeric and position it face down. The target will become thoroughly paralyzed—it cannot be otherwise. {7.3.45}</p>
<p>“The sixth method;</p>
<p>“He can also draw the same yantra-wheel, but write in it hūṁ hūṁ interspersed with the syllable phaṭ. He should write this on a human skull, with a human bone as the writing utensil, using poison, blood, and black mustard seed for ink. If he does this in a charnel ground, he will kill the target. {7.3.46}</p>
<p>“The seventh method;</p>
<p>“Another yantra-wheel should be identical, but he should intersperse hūṁ hūṁ with the syllable oṁ and write it on birchbark, using saffron for ink. He should offer yellow flowers or, alternatively, the five types of service. Through so doing the target will become enriched after seven days. {7.3.47}</p>
<p>“The eighth method;</p>
<p>“If he intersperses the same syllables with the word svāhā, he will ensure protection. {7.3.48}</p>
<p>“The ninth method;</p>
<p>“Using the same wheel, he can take the ten syllables of the mantric formula, this time interspersed with the syllable āḥ, and write the target’s name on an earthenware plate using white sandal as ink. He should then offer fragrant white flowers and make offerings according to his ability, reciting the mantra one hundred and eight times at the three junctions of the day, as prescribed. Through so doing the target will be pacified of negative influences after seven days. {7.3.49}</p>
<p>“The tenth method;</p>
<p>“Using the same wheel again, he should write ‘āḥ, of such and such’ in the center of the letter e. He should then write hūṁ above it, below it, and to its sides; vaṁ in the intermediate directions around it; and three lines surrounding everything on the outside. If he writes this on birchbark using bovine orpiment as ink, and then places the birchbark in ghee and honey, he will certainly enthrall the target after seven days. {7.3.50}</p>
<p>“The eleventh method;</p>
<p>“Using the same wheel, he should draw a lotus with four petals, each furnished with the syllable hrīṁ. In the center, he should write ‘hrīḥ, such and such’ surrounded by four hūṁ syllables. If he writes this with red sandalwood paste on unbaked earthenware he will be able to placate an angry person, there is no doubt about it. {7.3.51}</p>
<p>“The twelfth method;</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should draw two wheels on birchbark using saffron and bovine orpiment, or lac, as ink. He should wear one wheel and place the other wheel in ghee and honey and leave it there. Through so doing, whomever he has in mind will become a dear friend. {7.3.52}</p>
<p>“The mantra specific to some of these rituals is:</p>
<p>Oṁ, Tārā, you who bewilder everyone! Eager to save! Strong and powerful one! Bewilder all evildoers, bewilder! Blessed one! Bind all evildoers, bind! Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.53}</p>
<p>“The thirteenth method;</p>
<p>“If he ties a knot at the edge of his garment and sets out on a journey, he will not be robbed by robbers. {7.3.54}</p>
<p>“The fourteenth method;</p>
<p>“To whomever he gives a blue lotus marked with a wheel after incanting it with the appropriate mantra seven times, that person will be enthralled. This is the rite of the wheel marked with a blue lotus. {7.3.55}</p>
<p>“The fifteenth method;</p>
<p>“For the next yantra-wheel, the lotus to be drawn should have eight petals and be provided with the syllables hrīḥ and śrīḥ. On its anthers he should write ‘hrīḥ, such and such, śrīḥ.’ If he writes this on birchbark with bovine orpiment as ink and wears it, he will be fortunate in every respect. {7.3.56}</p>
<p>“The sixteenth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw a lotus with eight petals and write at its center the mantra of the ‘delusion family’ (oṁ). He should draw a circular line surrounding it and eight three-pronged vajra scepters surrounding that. If he draws this with saffron following the prescribed procedure and wears it, tied to his arm, he will always be protected. {7.3.57}</p>
<p>“The seventeenth method;</p>
<p>“The next yantra-wheel should be the same but without the vajra scepters. He should write on the pericarp, or on the outside the following:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, hūṁ hūṁ! Wake, wake! Devour, devour! Chop, chop! Shake, shake! Churn, churn! Bind, bind! Sow enmity between such-and-such and such-and-such! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.58}</p>
<p>“This is the mantra of Hayagrīva for sowing enmity. He should write this mantra with a substance suitable for the rites of assaulting in the center of a buffalo’s or horse’s hoof. He will cause enmity at that moment even between Śiva and Durgā, let alone ordinary humans. {7.3.59}</p>
<p>“The eighteenth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw two maṇḍalas of fire with a pair of corners below and above, following the prescribed rule. Above he should write hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ, and in the area below, hūṁ hūṁ phaṭ. Further, on the outer points of the triangles, he should write hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ, and in the center, hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ. He should draw all this with ink made from poison, blood, black mustard, charnel ground ash, juice from the leaves of the neem tree, and urine on a rag from a charnel ground or the rag of a madman. If he then encircles the entire diagram with the mantra of Mahābala and places the rag above a burning fire, he will paralyze the enemy. {7.3.60}</p>
<p>“The nineteenth method;</p>
<p>“He should depict a lotus, adorned with eight āḥ syllables on its petals, at the center of a square Indra maṇḍala with eight oṁ syllables positioned at its eight cardinal and intermediary points. On its pericarp should be positioned the target’s name adorned with four hūṁ syllables. If he encloses this in a two-piece earthenware dish and wraps it all around with a vajra cord while reciting the mantra words of invocation and meditating that Vajradhara stands astride the target’s head, this mantra wheel will paralyze all men, gods, and bodhisattvas. {7.3.61}</p>
<p>“The twentieth method;</p>
<p>“As for the next yantra-wheel, the maṇḍala of Indra should be marked with eight three-pronged vajra scepters. In the center of this maṇḍala should be a four-cornered maṇḍala, inscribed with the following mantras:</p>
<p>“In the east, ‘Oṁ, bring downfall! Pātanī, svāhā to you!’</p>
<p>In the south, ‘Oṁ, crush! Jambhanī, svāhā to you!’</p>
<p>In the west, ‘Oṁ, delude! Mohanī, svāhā to you!’</p>
<p>In the north, ‘Oṁ, paralyze! Stambhanī, svāhā to you!’ {7.3.62}</p>
<p>“He should then draw another maṇḍala of Indra inside that square maṇḍala and write at its center, ‘Please paralyze such and such.’ He should draw this yantra on birchbark with turmeric juice and then stuff it into a frog’s mouth. Piercing the mouth with a thorn of downy datura from above, he should fix the upper palate to the lower. Through so doing one will paralyze a hostile army at that very instant. {7.3.63}</p>
<p>“The twenty-first method;</p>
<p>“The next yantra-wheel should have a round shape with a five-pronged, crossed vajra scepter aligned with the intermediate directions. At the tip of its central prongs there should be four hūṁ syllables. On its hub he should write the following garland of mantra syllables:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, you step with your feet apart and you advance onward. You are the rising and the setting. You are the bright sun and the eclipsed sun. You are the waves. You are the woodlands and the undergrowth. You are monastic robes and you are great monastic robes. You are invisibility.Svāhā! {7.3.64}</p>
<p>“The syllable oṁ should be written everywhere. At the center of the circle should be drawn a three-pronged, crossed vajra scepter, aligned with the cardinal directions. On its central, left, and right prongs should be written, respectively, the mantras ‘Oṁ Vattalī!’ ‘Oṁ Varalī!’ and ‘Oṁ Varāmukhī!’ He should write thus on all the prongs, repeating the same pattern for each of the four tips of the crossed vajra scepter. In the northeast and other intermediate quarters he should write ‘Oṁ to Mārīcī.’ In the center he should write ‘Oṁ, Varālī! Vattālī! Varāhamukhī! Crush the body, speech, and mind of all the most wicked evildoers! Paralyze their mouths!’ In the center of that he should place the syllable māṁ and, in its center, the words ‘Protect such and such, protect!’ On the outside of the syllable māṁ he should write ‘Oṁ to the deity Mārīcī!’ If he draws this yantra-wheel on birchbark with saffron and wears it, he will always be protected. {7.3.65}</p>
<p>“The twenty-second method;</p>
<p>“He should make an effigy of a naked man with flowing hair and earrings in his ears. Atop its head there should be a three-pronged vajra scepter marked with the syllable haṁ. Above its forehead one should write lāṁ lāṁ. On its cheeks and throat, starting from the right side of its chin, he should write, ‘May the counter-spells ruin those who injure my mind.’ In the area from its navel to its mouth, he should draw the shape of a caitya. Above it, he should draw a five-pronged vajra scepter. He should then write the mantra of interdependent origination, ‘Those dharmas that arise from causes, etc.,’ forming the shape of a garland of words that extends from the right side of the hollow inside the caitya up to the chest, left, and then down. On its neck he should draw the syllable hūṁ upside down, and on its mid-torso, a five-pronged vajra scepter pointing upward. On both sides of its torso should be written twelve hūṁ syllables. Then, below, on the broad plinth of the caitya, he should write the vowels, but without the four neuter letters (ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, ḹ). On the flat surface of the effigy’s chest he should write, as before, ‘May the counter-spells ruin those who injure my mind,’ but this time in a straight line. He should also write the same in straight lines on its shanks and on its phallus. On each of its eight limbs, he should write puṁ puṁ raṁ. On the back of its hands, he should write tāṁ tāṁ, and on its feet, puṁ raṁ. He should have this effigy drawn using as ink poison, salt, black mustard, and neem leaf, mixed together with datura extract and charnel ground ash, while the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya. He should write ‘of such and such’ between the words of the mantra on the hub of the vajra scepter, using white sandalwood paste. For drawing the holy caitya he should likewise use white sandalwood paste, and for the vajra scepter with its hub he should use saffron. If he wears this with the spell inscribed on it, he will always have great protection. {7.3.66}</p>
<p>“The twenty-third method;</p>
<p>“He should draw Mount Sumeru with its eight spurs, adorned on top with a crossed, three-pronged, crossed vajra scepter. The spurs should be marked, in the corner areas of the yantra, with the syllable naṁ, and each enclosed by a pair of hūṁ syllables. He should write the four words alakta, kata, vāya, and māṃsaṃ between each two cardinal directions, starting from the northeast. He should surround all this with a circular line, and at its center draw Gaṇapati. He should be depicted in the form of the lord of dance, with a dish of sweetmeats and a rosary in his right hands, a three-pronged vajra scepter and a leaf-crowned radish in his left hands, seated on a lotus, and riding a shrew. {7.3.67}</p>
<p>“The mantra to recite is:</p>
<p>“Hūṁ gaḥ hūṁ hūṁ gaḥ gaḥ hūṁ! Please send rain! Hūṁ gaḥ gaḥ hūṁ! {7.3.68}</p>
<p>“He should write the short version of this mantra on the elephant god’s forehead, chest, hips, and above the navel. If he draws this on unbaked earthenware using blood from his ring finger mixed with the three pungent substances, and heats it in a fire of cutch-tree wood, it will definitely bring rain—it cannot be otherwise. If he draws the same, but with orpiment instead on the inner surface of the earthenware, and then heats it over fire, he will stop the rain. {7.3.69}</p>
<p>“The twenty-fourth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw a wheel with eight spokes and adorn it with eight gaḥ syllables. In its center, he should write the target’s name enclosed within the mantra, following the prescribed procedure. He should write this using orpiment and turmeric essence on a rag from a charnel ground or a rag that has been struck with a weapon. He should make an effigy of Gaṇapati from rice flour, placing this wheel in his chest. He should then put this effigy inside well-baked earthenware, wrap it on the outside with a yellow thread, and offer to it yellow flowers as prescribed. The rite described here, O goddess, is the supreme king of the rites of paralyzing. {7.3.70}</p>
<p>“The twenty-fifth method;</p>
<p>“He should write the following mantra in the center of the syllable māṁ:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vattālī! Varālī! Varāhamukhī! Paralyze the mouths of all the most wicked evildoers! {7.3.71}</p>
<p>“He should write this mantra using turmeric extract on two bricks. Having then joined them with a hollow in between, he should bury this device in the ground; it will paralyze all evildoers—it cannot be otherwise. {7.3.72}</p>
<p>“The twenty-sixth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw the yantra diagram on the ground in the form of a bhaga together with a liṅga, and write there the name of the target. Alone, he should urinate on this yantra for seven days until, following the procedure of surrounding her name with a noose formed from hrīḥ syllables, he causes the woman whom he desires to arrive. {7.3.73}</p>
<p>“The twenty-seventh method;</p>
<p>“He should draw a wheel with eight spokes in the center of a moon disk. In the divisions he should draw, in short, a vajra scepter, a banner, an axe, a trident, a noose, a double vajra scepter, a khaṭvāṅga, and a goad. In the center of the circle he should draw a full moon disk and, in the center of this moon, he should write, “May such and such a man and such and such a woman obtain a son.” In the hub of the wheel he should write the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Maṇidharī! Vajriṇī! Mahāpratisarā! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.74}</p>
<p>“Then, in the center of a moon disk, he should write this mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Amṛtavilokinī! Protectress of the womb! Summoner of the being to be born! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.75}</p>
<p>“If he writes this mantra on birchbark using saffron and bovine orpiment while the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya, and wears it, he will obtain a son. {7.3.76}</p>
<p>“The twenty-eighth method;</p>
<p>“A wheel should be drawn in the shape of a pitcher with a neck, and the neck should be long. Following the prescibed procedure, he should write ‘yaḥ plea yaḥ se yaḥ ex yaḥ pel yaḥ such yaḥ and yaḥ such yaḥ!’ using crow’s blood as ink on a piece of cloth that was used as a banner in a temple of the supreme deity. He should write on it the name of the target and tie this to the neck of a live crow. He should then release the crow in the northwestern direction. Whoever’s name it was, this person will be exiled. {7.3.77}</p>
<p>“The twenty-ninth method;</p>
<p>“He should draw a wheel with eight spokes in the center of a sun disk. The syllable hūṁ—the elemental seed—should be nestled within it. He should visualize the vajra sun, and then write the target’s name enclosed within the mantra. If the practitioner draws and writes this, as prescribed, on birchbark using saffron and bovine orpiment, and wears it, he will always be protected. {7.3.78}</p>
<p>“The thirtieth method;</p>
<p>“A lotus should be drawn with twenty-four petals, surrounded by a triple line. By writing oṁ hrīṁ klīṁ on it, as prescribed, while the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya, and holding it in his hand, he will be able to turn anyone into his servant with a mere touch of the hand. {7.3.79}</p>
<p>“The thirty-first method;</p>
<p>“A wheel should be drawn in the shape of a tambourine and adorned with a vajra scepter and a lotus. On the outside it should be surrounded with a triple line representing, in short, the vajra body, and so forth. By meditating intently on the vajra of action all his enemies will be crushed. And all activities will be accomplished with the mantras sanctioned by the ritual procedure. The mantras are these:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, smother, smother! Hūṁ hūṁ, phaṭ! Oṁ, seize seize! Hūṁ hūṁ, phaṭ! Oṁ, hand them over, do! Hūṁ hūṁ, phaṭ! Bring them over, O Lord Vidyārāja! Hūṁ hūṁ, phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.80}</p>
<p>“The thirty-second method;</p>
<p>“The eighth syllable within the ya group (ha),</p>
<p>Joined with the twelve vowels,</p>
<p>And with the six intermediary syllables (hā, hī, hū, hai, hau, haḥ) removed,</p>
<p>Constitutes the six limbs of Heruka (ha, hi, hu, he, ho, haṁ). {7.3.81}</p>
<p>“These six syllables are in union with the six-section mantra of the six heroes,</p>
<p>And each syllable is assigned a place.</p>
<p>The first one is the heart.</p>
<p>The second is declared to be the head. {7.3.82}</p>
<p>“The third one should be assigned the topknot.</p>
<p>The fourth will be the armor.</p>
<p>The fifth will be the eyes,</p>
<p>And the sixth is said to be the weapon. {7.3.83}</p>
<p>“He is together with Vajravārāhī,</p>
<p>Adorned with four arms,</p>
<p>Crowned by a divine yellow halo,</p>
<p>And his hair is bedecked with a crescent moon. {7.3.84}</p>
<p>“He wears a necklace of human bone</p>
<p>And has a khaṭvāṅga in his hand.</p>
<p>Having thus generated himself as Heruka,</p>
<p>He should stay mindful of being him. {7.3.85}</p>
<p>“In his heart he should visualize the wisdom being</p>
<p>And place a perimeter wall in the four quarters.</p>
<p>He should visualize him surrounded by flames of anger,</p>
<p>Ferocious and adorned with frightening ornaments, {7.3.86}</p>
<p>“Driving away and nailing down the hordes of obstacle makers, and threatening the gods, demigods, and humans who dwell throughout all directions. Wearing his armor, he cannot be destroyed even by the thirty-three gods. {7.3.87}</p>
<p>“Next, he should draw a maṇḍala</p>
<p>With four sides and four gates.</p>
<p>In its center he should place</p>
<p>A six-petaled lotus, complete with filaments. {7.3.88}</p>
<p>“Making it double, the mantrin</p>
<p>Should also draw the circle of ḍākinīs.</p>
<p>On the pericarp, he should place the hero (Heruka)</p>
<p>And, in addition, the ḍākinī. {7.3.89}</p>
<p>“The gates should be yellow all around</p>
<p>And marked wih three-pronged vajra scepters.</p>
<p>He should place the messenger goddesses at the inner sanctum,</p>
<p>And likewise at the doors, according to the right order. {7.3.90}</p>
<p>“If a lay vow holder wears this yantra-wheel, having first offered worship with many offerings when the planets were auspicious, he will be protected from untimely death, armed conflicts, and so forth. About my words, O goddess, there can be no doubt. This yantra-wheel is called ‘one which brings victory over enemies.’ {7.3.91}</p>
<p>“The thirty-third method;</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he should etch on a copper plate, during the asterism of Puṣya, the same wheel and mantra, but without the gates. The mantra should be interspersed with the target’s name. If he places it in water and makes offerings to it three times a day, then all enemies will become completely immobilized. When a well-focused practitioner of mantra puts this, as prescribed, in a covered pool that does not dry up, he can bring an appeasement. {7.3.92}</p>
<p>“The thirty-fourth method;</p>
<p>“There is also another yantra-wheel with four corners, four gates, and archways adorned with vajra scepters. At the gates there should be respectively a vajra hammer, a bejeweled staff, a lotus, and a vajra sword. In the corners, inside white skull cups, there should be blue lotuses and goads. In the center among them there should be a lotus with ten petals, on which the wise practitioner should place the syllables. At its pericarp, he should write the following excellent mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Prasannatārā! One with the face and eyes of an immortal! Fulfiller of all aims! Svāhā!</p>
<p>“He should write this mantra during rites of enthralling. {7.3.93}</p>
<p>“The thirty-fifth method;</p>
<p>“Now, for the rite of averting all mischief-makers, the following mantra has been prescribed:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Tārā, you who bewilder everyone! Eager to save! Bewilder all evildoers, bewilder! Blessed one! Bind all evildoers, bind! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.3.94}</p>
<p>“The thirty-sixth method;</p>
<p>“In the center of the aforementioned ten-petaled lotus he should depict a moon disk, and in the center of the moon disk he should draw the first letter of the fourth group (ta) in the form of lotus filament, which is circular in design. In the six divisions around its center he should place six syllables of the mantric formula, interspersed with the syllable hrīḥ, following the prescribed procedure. This yantra-wheel is called ‘the beneficial influence of Tārā that vanquishes an entire army.’ By reciting it 100,000 times, he can make the earth shake, dry up oceans and other water reservoirs, and turn poison into nectar, or nectar into poison. Having incanted a bowl of candied sugar, he should throw the sugar in the cardinal and intermediate directions, above and below. As a result, the gods, demigods, yakṣas, rākṣasas, gandharvas, kinnaras, and mahoragas will all become bound. He will steal magical potions from all the ḍākinīs and poisons from all the nāgas. If he incants candied sugar and throws it into a river, the river will flow upstream. With the same candied sugar he will be able to arrest the waves. If he recites the mantra 1,000 times while facing upward, he can prevent a heavy rain from falling. If he recites the mantra 1,000 times in the direction of an enemy army, and then enters battle, he will meet with no harm even when struck with hundreds of weapons. He cannot be chopped up. His body becomes a diamond body. He will perform many miracles, and will play with deities invoked by this king of mantras.” {7.3.95}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the seventh chapter, called “The Benefits of Yantra-Wheels Used for the Complete Range of Activity.”</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>[The goddess said:]</p>
<p>“May the lord explain the fine details</p>
<p>Of consecration rites, how they should be performed—</p>
<p>I do not know about the mantra recitation and meditation.</p>
<p>And what is the right procedure for the rite of homa? {7.4.1}</p>
<p>“Blessed One, in your being you are the essence of vajra,</p>
<p>The fusion of all sublime qualities.</p>
<p>Please teach out of your kindness,</p>
<p>You who possess great bliss, and are so difficult to find.” {7.4.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Listen O goddess! I will explain the act</p>
<p>Of meditation according to its prescribed routine.</p>
<p>Through methods involving merely meditation</p>
<p>One will be able to accomplish all actions.” {7.4.3}</p>
<p>Then, to first explain the purification of the ground, the Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“One should assume the divine pride of Vajrasattva</p>
<p>And establish oneself in the nonduality that accompanies such pride.</p>
<p>Having become the conqueror of the three worlds,</p>
<p>One should uproot all obstacle makers. {7.4.4}</p>
<p>“One should position one’s feet as instructed</p>
<p>And so also the feet of the goddesses.</p>
<p>The homa rite should be as has been taught</p>
<p>And so should be the characteristics of the fire pit. {7.4.5}</p>
<p>“Then one should apply the hand gestures,</p>
<p>And later draw the maṇḍala. {7.4.6}</p>
<p>“Becoming the deity Krodhavijaya, one should visualize oneself as having three faces and six arms. One should radiate cloud masses of Krodhavijayas, which invoke all the tathāgatas and their retinues throughout the ten directions, supplicating them, ‘May you please attend to the places of consecration and provide protection for the teacher and his disciples.’ One should then absorb the Krodhavijayas, along with the supplicated tathāgatas, and internalize them, placing them in a hūṁ syllable at the hub of a vajra scepter on a moon disk in one’s heart. Having fused the form of Vajradhara, in union with his consort (vidyā), with all the blessed tathāgatas, one should form the mudrā called ‘the turning of the lotus,’ preceded by the blessing with the three-letter consecration, and then perform the required set of motions with the vajra scepter in one’s right hand. With one’s left hand, one should sound the bell harmoniously. On the soles of one’s feet one should visualize a syllable hūṁ which transforms into a blazing vajra scepter. Then, with the pride of being Krodhavijaya who makes the sound hūṁ, a wise practitioner should expel all obstructors, first by exclaiming hūṁ, and then by addressing the following words, while visualizing himself in Krodha’s form, to the gods, demigods, and guhyakas: {7.4.7}</p>
<p>“ ‘May all gods, demigods, yakṣas, rākṣasas, pretas, piśācas, apasmaras, bhūtas, ḍākinīs, ostārakas, male and female elders—all with their retinues of followers—garuḍas, kinnaras, and semi-divine adepts of spells, depart! A regal maṇḍala of such and such a deity needs to be drawn at this place in order that such and such a student attains a perfect awakening under the guidance of such and such a master, and in order that all beings obtain unsurpassable wisdom. You must therefore swiftly depart upon hearing this command by Vajradhara. If anyone does not run away, then Vajrapāṇi, the blazing Hūṁkāra with an angry face, will split his head into a hundred pieces with the brightly shining vajra scepter of great wisdom!’ {7.4.8}</p>
<p>“When this command has been pronounced three times, he should radiate wrathful forms of himself as Krodhavijaya while doing the ritual movements with his great vajra scepter. Walking around the maṇḍala ground, tempestuously, with a vajra step, he should drive away all mischief-makers. Thus should he claim the ground. {7.4.9}</p>
<p>“Then, having summoned the earth goddess, he should perform by means of the mantra the consecration and the tutelage rites. He should pay homage to his master—his mantra instructor—and afterward summon, cause to enter, and bind the gold-colored earth goddess who is holding a pitcher in her hand. He should worship her with the five types of service involving fragrant perfume, and so forth. After he has made her occupy the maṇḍala ground, he should remain near her.” {7.4.10}</p>
<p>Now the Blessed One gave the mantra of summoning:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, come, come! O great goddess, mother of the earthly realm, adorned with all the richly bejeweled ornaments, resounding with the tinkling of necklaces and anklets, you who are so bountifully worshiped by Vajrasattva! Take this welcome offering and bring success to the homa rites! Hrī hī hī hī haṁ! Svāhā!” {7.4.11}</p>
<p>[And he continued further:]</p>
<p>“Having performed with this mantra the rite of the goddess’s tutelage over the maṇḍala, he should perform the anointing of the ground. He should thus sprinkle and smear the ground with feces, urine, and so forth. He should then cense it with an incense of human flesh. After censing the ground, he should make offerings, and then place the ‘seal’ in the center, meaning he should usher in the consort (vidyā).” {7.4.12}</p>
<p>Vajragarbha asked:</p>
<p>“Should he, O Blessed One, usher in a consort (vidyā)-goddess who has been cast or otherwise artificially made, drawn in whatever way, or fashioned from wood or other such materials?” {7.4.13}</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“He should usher in a human girl of the cāṇḍāla or similar caste. If such cannot be procured, he should take one from a caste different from his own. He should place the mantra syllables on her body. The syllable hrīḥ should be placed on all her limbs. The syllable hrīṁ should be placed on her chest, between her eyebrows, on her throat and head. The syllable bhruṁ should be placed in the center of her vulva.” {7.4.14}</p>
<p>“And where, O Blessed One, should the syllable bhrūṁ be placed, [if it is placed] in the middle of her body?” {7.4.15}</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“By the word middle, O sons of the buddha family, navel is meant. There he should place the syllable bhrūṁ. Having thus placed the syllables, he should visualize the forms of Locanā and other tathāgata consorts. At this point, he should visualize a brahmin or a śūdra consort in the form of Locanā—if it is the rite of pacifying, it should be the form of Locanā. He should visualize her as white and adorned with all manner of jewelry. If it is the rite of enthralling, he should visualize a woman from the cāṇḍāla caste in the form of red Tārā. If it is the rite of enriching, he should visualize a dancer woman or a woman of royal lineage as the yellow Pāṇḍaravāsinī. Thus, following the divisions of the types of activity, he should worship the consort with the five types of service, and offer a handful of flowers. He should place on her vulva blood or semen. In this way, the ground where the homa rite is to take place will be purified. {7.4.16}</p>
<p>“A girl, one from a caste different than his own, should be instructed in the maṇḍala procedure. As this pertains to the maṇḍala, she should also be instructed in the rites of homa, including the secret maṇḍala of phenomena. Following this rule, he should measure out a twofold maṇḍala—the external one of colored powders, and the secret maṇḍala of phenomena that concerns his own samaya. Accordingly, he should prepare a sacrificial fire pit in an area that is a place of pilgrimage for yogins.”</p>
<p>So spoke the Blessed One. {7.4.17}</p>
<p>And he said further:</p>
<p>“I will now teach the rite of homa</p>
<p>That makes different rites effective.</p>
<p>Those gods among whom Agni is the foremost</p>
<p>Are dependent upon the principle of homa. {7.4.18}</p>
<p>“Through oblation the gods are satiated;</p>
<p>When satiated, they grant success.</p>
<p>Mantras that are recited inadequately or excessively,</p>
<p>All become complete through homa. {7.4.19}</p>
<p>“Therefore homa is praised</p>
<p>By the vajrins who possess the three bodies.</p>
<p>The fire obtained by whirling a stick</p>
<p>Will make the rite beneficial. {7.4.20}</p>
<p>“The fire obtained from an untouchable or from a charnel ground</p>
<p>Will be effective in rites that bring harm.</p>
<p>The pit should be round, or square,</p>
<p>Or shaped like a crescent moon, or triangular. {7.4.21}</p>
<p>“With its boundary marked with vajra scepters,</p>
<p>The pit should fit within the outer circle.</p>
<p>He who knows the nature of homa should place</p>
<p>In the center of the pit, on top of a lotus, {7.4.22}</p>
<p>“A diadem, a lotus, a vajra scepter, or a jewel,</p>
<p>[Depending on which of the rites is being performed].</p>
<p>He should sit [facing the direction] as specified [for each rite],</p>
<p>With his elbows between the knees. {7.4.23}</p>
<p>“The ladle for liquids should overflow with ghee</p>
<p>So that the [solids] to be offered become saturated.</p>
<p>On the right side should be the materials to be burned,</p>
<p>And on the left, a dish with water. {7.4.24}</p>
<p>“In front, there should be a dish with the welcome offering. While chanting the ‘all-purpose’ mantra, he should perform the rites of sprinkling and sipping of water. He should encircle the pit all around with the straight tips of kuśa grass blades. {7.4.25}</p>
<p>“Observing that the fire has started,</p>
<p>He should summon the fire deity</p>
<p>With the following mantra, following the rule,</p>
<p>Moving his right thumb in a gesture of fearlessness: {7.4.26}</p>
<p>“Come, come, O great god of beings,</p>
<p>Best among the sages and twice born!</p>
<p>Take the oblatory food</p>
<p>And approach me!</p>
<p>“Oṁ, fire, blaze, blaze! Penetrate, O splendorous one, to carry away this burnt offering, svāhā! {7.4.27}</p>
<p>“He should consecrate the five articles of offering,</p>
<p>Besprinkling them with the vajra scepter held in his left hand.</p>
<p>He should visualize, arriving from the southeast,</p>
<p>The god of fire with protruding belly, three eyes, {7.4.28}</p>
<p>“Four faces, four arms, red in color,</p>
<p>And matted hair tied in a topknot.</p>
<p>He is in the midst of a circle of fire</p>
<p>And is adorned with the light rays of the four activities. {7.4.29}</p>
<p>“His first right hand is in the boon-granting gesture;</p>
<p>In the second, he holds a rosary of rudrākṣa beads.</p>
<p>In the first left hand he holds a water pitcher,</p>
<p>And in the second, a staff. {7.4.30}</p>
<p>“He is bedecked with red adornments</p>
<p>And surrounded by a retinue of sages.</p>
<p>Visualizing him in this form,</p>
<p>He should cause him to enter the fire pit. {7.4.31}</p>
<p>“The burnt offerings should be offered three times,</p>
<p>Using up all the articles to be burned.</p>
<p>Next, he should perform the ritual sipping of water,</p>
<p>And thereby transform the offerings into the form of flames. {7.4.32}</p>
<p>“By applying this method stage by stage</p>
<p>The wise practitioner will satiate the deity.</p>
<p>Having satiated and propitiated him,</p>
<p>He should tell him what accomplishments he desires. {7.4.33}</p>
<p>“Playfully he may assume the shapes of a parasol,</p>
<p>A banner, a vajra scepter, a pitcher, a lotus, and a goad.</p>
<p>His flames will have one, two, or three tongues,</p>
<p>Shooting high, or burning low, or medium height.</p>
<p>The wise practitioner will interpret these signs:</p>
<p>In particular, if the flames swirl clockwise {7.4.34}</p>
<p>“And have a bright white color,</p>
<p>He will interpret this as boding well.</p>
<p>The flames may have the pure colors of a rainbow,</p>
<p>Be smooth, and have the radiance of a firefly. {7.4.35}</p>
<p>“They may have the same hue as saffron or beryl,</p>
<p>And be fragrant and pleasing to the mind,</p>
<p>Shining like gold or silver, without smoke,</p>
<p>Burning with the pure radiance of the sun. {7.4.36}</p>
<p>“White-colored flames are suitable for the rites of pacifying;</p>
<p>For the rites of enriching they should be yellow.</p>
<p>They should be red for acts of impassioning,</p>
<p>And an exquisite deep blue or black for rites of assaulting. {7.4.37}</p>
<p>“Likewise, he should observe whether the fire has many flames and belches smoke and sparks, or whether it gradually rises or very slowly wanes. The fire may look unpleasant, or be dark green in color; it may resemble a spear or a sun, or the head of a cow. It may smell of a corpse or a cow, or possibly a donkey. He should thus divine by the signs of the fire whether there will be obstacles, and if so, he should neutralize them. {7.4.38}</p>
<p>“If he relies on mantra recitation and meditation,</p>
<p>Every accomplishment will soon follow. {7.4.39}</p>
<p>“The mantra should begin with oṁ and end with svāhā.</p>
<p>For the rites of pacifying, enriching, and enthralling,</p>
<p>He should chant it as a song</p>
<p>Without any breaks between individual sounds. {7.4.40}</p>
<p>“For the rite of pacifying, the practitioner should have a peaceful mind.</p>
<p>For enriching, increase will come through adopting a satiated frame of mind.</p>
<p>During the rite of enthralling, his mind should be enthralled,</p>
<p>Intoxicated with love, and full of amorous wantonness. {7.4.41}</p>
<p>“If he follows the procedure for the rites of assaulting,</p>
<p>He should engender thoughts of devouring the three realms.</p>
<p>He should employ the syllables hūṁ and phaṭ</p>
<p>While visualizing his body ablaze with flames. {7.4.42}</p>
<p>“He should intersperse the words of supplication,</p>
<p>Combining them with the syllables of the mantra.</p>
<p>Whatever gods are employed for whomever’s sake,</p>
<p>He should worship them with various rites. {7.4.43}</p>
<p>“The mantra adept who is familiar with the rules</p>
<p>Involved in all the procedures of the homa rite</p>
<p>Should first offer the complete burnt offering</p>
<p>And then commence with the activity. {7.4.44}</p>
<p>“He should supplicate the deity employing the essence of homa—</p>
<p>This is the procedure to follow when offering homa.</p>
<p>In the rites of pacifying, enriching, or enthralling,</p>
<p>The homa should consist of semen. {7.4.45}</p>
<p>“Through the homa consisting of feces, urine, blood, bone marrow, bones, and human flesh, all the recipients become filled with joy.” {7.4.46}</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having entered the samādhi called “The Vajra That Accomplishes the Wisdom Circle of the Vajra-Tathāgata Great Vairocana,” taught the elaborate outer and inner ritual methods for accomplishing the complete wisdom circle: {7.4.47}</p>
<p>“Whatever deity is brought inside the center of the circle, that circle is praised by the buddhas as the vajra maṇḍala that is to be indicated with the name of that deity. {7.4.48}</p>
<p>“He should perform the rites of pacifying, enriching,</p>
<p>Enthralling, and assaulting with authority,</p>
<p>Applying thereto the powers of wisdom</p>
<p>Of the maṇḍala’s main deity. {7.4.49}</p>
<p>“He should visualize inside the bhaga</p>
<p>The disk of a full moon, and on it,</p>
<p>Arising out of the imagined syllable tāṁ,</p>
<p>The goddess Tārā, she who has great magical powers. {7.4.50}</p>
<p>“She is imbued with the sentiment of erotic love; she has sixteen arms and seven faces, each one with three eyes, and is smiling. She is emerald in color and replete with the freshness of youth. She wears brightly colored clothes, a pearl necklace, anklets, a choker, a diadem, arm bracelets, earrings, a waist chain, and so forth. She is adorned with different kinds of jewelry; her hair is adorned with a blue lotus flower and her body hue resembles barley flowers. She stands with her left leg outstretched and her right slightly bent, inspiring fear even in the masters of the realms of the thirty-three (Indra) who fold their hands in a gesture of reverence. She is ablaze with red flames and surrounded by buddhas radiating light all around. If the practitioner visualizes her, the dear mother of all sentient beings, as such, he will swiftly attain the state of awakening. {7.4.51}</p>
<p>“In her first right hand she holds a sword; in the second, a blue lotus; in the third, an arrow; in the fourth, a vajra scepter; in the fifth, a goad; in the sixth, a staff; in the seventh, a flaying knife; and with the eighth she displays the mudrā of fearlessness. In her first left hand she holds a human skull cup; with the second she displays the threatening mudrā; in the third she holds a bow; in the fourth, a khaṭvāṅga; in the fifth, a noose; in the sixth, a trident; in the seventh, a jewel; and in the eighth, a pitcher. {7.4.52}</p>
<p>“Her first face on the right side is blue, and the second one blazes with the color yellow. The first face on the left side is white, and the second has the greenish color of beryl. Her upper face bares its fangs, and is smoky in color, frighteningly contorted, hideous, and terrifying. So should he visualize the goddess who bounteously bestows all accomplishments. {7.4.53}</p>
<p>“Further above, he should visualize another face with the form of a donkey’s, or some other desired form. With her four feet, a trident, and snakes wrapped around, she is referred to as “Herukī,” and should be visualized as the ultimate cause of accomplishments. Inside the bhaga he should visualize, arising from the syllable yaṁ, the maṇḍala of wind, which has the appearance of smoke. Above it, in the center of a moon disk, he should visualize himself in the form of Mañjuśrī transformed from the syllable dhīḥ. In his heart he should visualize a sun disk transformed from the syllable āḥ. From this sun disk, he should radiate rays of light and make offerings with them as prescribed. Above the sun disk, he should visualize the syllable hūṁ made of five-colored light. This syllable is transformed into Vajrabhairava with nine faces and the form of a buffalo. He has sixteen feet and thirty-four arms. He is naked and black in color with great brilliance. The crown of his head is adorned with five skulls and he inspires great fear. He stands with his left leg outstretched and his right slightly bent, with his liṅga erect. He has a protruding belly, a huge body, and upward flowing hair resembling a blazing sun. He is adorned with a garland of skulls and other ornaments. He makes a roaring sound like at the time of the final dissolution of the world. He should visualize him consuming human blood, fat, serum, flesh, lymph, and bone marrow, while devouring the triple universe along with Brahmā, Indra, Upendra, Rudra, and so forth. {7.4.54}</p>
<p>“With his loud laughter and lolling tongue he frightens even fear itself. His first face is that of a buffalo. On his right horn there are three faces—blue, red, and yellow—each contorted with anger. On the left horn, the three faces are white, smoky, and black. Between the two horns there is an intensely red face with blood streaming from its mouth. Above it there is the princely youth Mañjuśrī, intensely yellow, semi-wrathful, wearing the ornaments of youth and a crown of five strips of cloth. Having stabilized this visualization, the mantra adept should cultivate himself as the deity with a well-focused mind. {7.4.55}</p>
<p>“Furthermore, in his first hand on the right, Vajrabhairava holds a flaying knife; in the second, a javelin; in the third, a mace; in the fourth, a small knife; in the fifth, a half-spear; in the sixth, an axe; in the seventh, a spear; in the eighth, an arrow; in the ninth, a goad; in the tenth, a club; in the eleventh, a khaṭvāṅga; in the twelfth, a discus; in the thirteenth, a vajra scepter; in the fourteenth, a vajra hammer; in the fifteenth, a sword; and in the sixteenth, a ḍamaru. {7.4.56}</p>
<p>“On the left side, in his first hand, he holds a skull cup; in the second, a human head; in the third, a shield; in the fourth, a foot; in the fifth, a noose; in the sixth, a bow; in the seventh, entrails; in the eighth, a bell; in the ninth, a hand; in the tenth, a rag from a charnel ground; in the eleventh, a man impaled on a stake; in the twelfth, a fire pit; and in the thirteenth, a goblet. With the fourteenth he displays the threatening mudrā; with the fifteenth, a hand gesture with three fingers stretched out; and in the sixteenth, he holds a ‘wind-cloth.’ With the remaining pair of hands he holds an elephant hide. {7.4.57}</p>
<p>“Under his right foot there are men, buffaloes, bulls, donkeys, camels, dogs, rams, and jackals. Under his left foot there are vultures, owls, crows, parrots, hawks, cocks, eagles, and cranes. He should visualize Vajrabhairava as such. Optionally, he should commission a painting of him. {7.4.58}</p>
<p>“Below Vajrabhairava he should visualize a great cemetery overrun with rākṣasas, kṣetrapālas, and vetālas; filled with humans impaled on stakes, humans hanged from banyan trees, burning humans, humans pierced with spears, lots of crows and other birds, and dogs; and resounding with disquieting laughter, hā hā. So should the practitioner visualize the Great Bhairava who makes all cruel rites successful.” {7.4.59}</p>
<p>So spoke the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“Next, he should visualize arising from the syllable māṁ</p>
<p>The goddess Mārīcī, as bright as the sun,</p>
<p>Riding on a chariot drawn by seven horses</p>
<p>And radiant with a halo of flames around her. {7.4.60}</p>
<p>“Each of her three faces has three eyes.</p>
<p>She is yellow and has six arms.</p>
<p>The face on the right is blue;</p>
<p>The one on the left is the color of jasmine flowers or the moon. {7.4.61}</p>
<p>“She is resplendent with the light of manifold rays.</p>
<p>She is engaged in guarding the ten directions.</p>
<p>Being in the throes of youth she is smiling, with all her faces</p>
<p>Expressing the sentiment of erotic love. {7.4.62}</p>
<p>“Her body is adorned with various garments</p>
<p>And bedecked with all types of jewelry.</p>
<p>Her crown is set with the five buddhas</p>
<p>And her matted hair adorned with flowers. {7.4.63}</p>
<p>“In her first right hand she carries a vajra scepter;</p>
<p>In the second, a threaded needle;</p>
<p>And in the third, she holds up an arrow.</p>
<p>With her first left hand she displays a threatening gesture and carries a noose; {7.4.64}</p>
<p>“In the second, she carries an aśoka sprout;</p>
<p>And in the third, a bow.</p>
<p>She is surrounded by multicolored light</p>
<p>That radiates cloud-like masses of buddhas. {7.4.65}</p>
<p>“While this is being visualized, living beings</p>
<p>Are brought to the state of enthrallment.”</p>
<p>So spoke the Blessed Vajra holder,</p>
<p>The tathāgata Vajrasattva. {7.4.66}</p>
<p>“In the center of the expanse of the sky</p>
<p>He should visualize a sun disk.</p>
<p>On it, transformed from the syllable paṁ,</p>
<p>Is the goddess Parṇaśāvarī, yellow in color and with great splendor. {7.4.67}</p>
<p>“Each of her three faces has three eyes,</p>
<p>And the faces are smiling and angry at the same time.</p>
<p>She is beautified by all manner of adornments;</p>
<p>She has six arms and is endowed with the freshness of youth. {7.4.68}</p>
<p>“In her first right hand she holds a vajra scepter; in the second, an axe; and in the third, an arrow. {7.4.69}</p>
<p>“In her first left hand, formed into a threatening gesture,</p>
<p>She holds a noose;</p>
<p>In the second, a feather chowrie; and in the third, a bow.</p>
<p>Her topknot is adorned with flowers. {7.4.70}</p>
<p>“She stands on a white lotus,</p>
<p>Adorned by a red glow.</p>
<p>Engulfed in the flames of the fire of rage,</p>
<p>She inspires fear with her burning rage. {7.4.71}</p>
<p>“Any grahas that harm living beings are burned. {7.4.72}</p>
<p>“Ablaze with anger, she is unshakable,</p>
<p>With Akṣobhya mounted on her head.</p>
<p>She is nevertheless white when raining down</p>
<p>The five-colored nectar of the five buddhas. {7.4.73}</p>
<p>“Her right and left faces are as previously described. So should the practitioner meditate for the sake of pacifying all illusion that stems from misapprehension. Parṇaśāvarī truly is the remover of all illnesses.”</p>
<p>So spoke the blessed tathāgata Great Vajra. {7.4.74}</p>
<p>“Listen, O goddess, O very fortunate one,</p>
<p>About the meditation on Vajrakrodha!</p>
<p>Assuming his form,</p>
<p>[The practitioner] should visualize him, the lord of anger, {7.4.75}</p>
<p>“As having four arms and four faces,</p>
<p>Or up to 100,000 arms and faces.</p>
<p>His body is white, he is fiercely angry, and he gazes at Vajravārāhī,</p>
<p>Who is of the same color as him and holds her usual implements. {7.4.76}</p>
<p>“He wears a garland of skulls;</p>
<p>His limbs are smeared with ashes.</p>
<p>He is adorned with the five mudrās,</p>
<p>And his hair, tied in a topknot, is marked with a spear-point. {7.4.77}</p>
<p>“His face, with fangs showing slightly, is terrible.</p>
<p>His seat is made of the great preta,</p>
<p>In the center of an eight-petaled lotus.</p>
<p>He is red in color, with the same hue all over. {7.4.78}</p>
<p>“He is adorned with an image of a buddha on top of his head,</p>
<p>And accompanied by four wisdom goddesses.</p>
<p>Each of the four has the form of a horse, and so forth,</p>
<p>Four arms, four faces, and is bedecked with adornments made of serpents. {7.4.79}</p>
<p>“He is furnished with individual syllables, one at a time,</p>
<p>Stands on a human skull, and is white in color.</p>
<p>He is adorned with four faces,</p>
<p>And ornamented with the syllables ya, ra, la, and va. {7.4.80}</p>
<p>“He should then commence the practice, to the extent possible, according to procedure. Starting from the northwest and following the order of the quarters, he should [visualize the deity adorned with elements] in the colors of smoke, red, yellow, and white, respectively. Merely by visualizing this in meditation, he can make a woman drip like an incised milk tree—it cannot be otherwise. {7.4.81}</p>
<p>“[Alternatively, Vajrakrodha is visualized] as red,</p>
<p>With four arms, and marked with the syllable raṁ.</p>
<p>He is surrounded by a halo of flames and terrifying;</p>
<p>He has four faces and is adorned with an [upper] face of a jackal. {7.4.82}</p>
<p>“Visualizing tiny vajra scepters,</p>
<p>Transformed from the syllable hūṁ</p>
<p>And emerging in great numbers from the tip of his nose,</p>
<p>He should fill the target’s body with them. {7.4.83}</p>
<p>“With the target’s body bound</p>
<p>At all its joints by the double vajra scepters,</p>
<p>His body is set ablaze and gushes blood</p>
<p>Through being struck with the vajra scepter. {7.4.84}</p>
<p>“He should visualize Vajraḍākinīs</p>
<p>Sucking the target’s blood from every side. {7.4.85}</p>
<p>“The mantra to recite is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vajraḍākinī! Please draw the blood of such and such! Hūṁ phaṭ! {7.4.86}</p>
<p>“The ultimate way to draw blood</p>
<p>Is through this method with its stages.</p>
<p>So it has been taught, O goddess!</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the target will wither. {7.4.87}</p>
<p>“Now, he should visualize Vajrakrodha in the terrifying</p>
<p>Form of a buffalo, arisen completely from the true essence.</p>
<p>He is black and horrible,</p>
<p>With four frightening faces. {7.4.88}</p>
<p>“He has eight arms and four feet. In his four right hands he is holding, respectively, a vajra hammer, a sword, a discus, and a ḍamaru. In the left ones he holds a khaṭvāṅga, a skull cup, a bow, and a noose. {7.4.89}</p>
<p>“He should then emanate Vajrakrodhas</p>
<p>Armed with a variety of weapons.</p>
<p>He should mentally remove</p>
<p>The target’s protection according to procedure. {7.4.90}</p>
<p>“He should visualize the target</p>
<p>Being bound by those Vajrakrodhas with fetters</p>
<p>And dragged in the southern direction,</p>
<p>While being struck by other Vajrakrodhas with vajra scepters {7.4.91}</p>
<p>“And cut open by them with swords,</p>
<p>With feces flowing from his ripped entrails. {7.4.92}</p>
<p>“The mantra to repeat is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vajrarākṣasa, devour him! Phaṭ! {7.4.93}</p>
<p>“He should then meditate on Vajrarākṣasa, visualizing him with a dog’s face. {7.4.94}</p>
<p>“The following mantra is of Yama in his buffalo-faced form:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, hrīḥ ṣṭrīḥ! You with contorted face! Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.4.95}</p>
<p>“He should visualize the target surrounded</p>
<p>On all sides by crows, jackals, and vultures;</p>
<p>While supplicating, he should visualize</p>
<p>The target being torn to pieces by them. {7.4.96}</p>
<p>“He should then visualize [a camel] with teeth of diamond,</p>
<p>Mounted on a maṇḍala of the element of wind.</p>
<p>He should visualize the target</p>
<p>Mounted on its back {7.4.97}</p>
<p>“And tormented by Vajrakrodha,</p>
<p>While being led in the southern direction.</p>
<p>Using ink made from leaves whirled up by the wind</p>
<p>And dust from the target’s footprint, {7.4.98}</p>
<p>“He should write the target’s name</p>
<p>And conceal it in a camel’s hoof.</p>
<p>Employing the visualization as described,</p>
<p>He should perform the rite according to procedure. {7.4.99}</p>
<p>“He will then be able to drive away even Śakra,</p>
<p>Let alone ordinary earthly people. {7.4.100}</p>
<p>“He should obtain the bodily hair of a brahmin and a monk,</p>
<p>And wrap with them [two] feathers of an owl, [one with each].</p>
<p>He should write targets’ names on them, interspersed with the mantra,</p>
<p>And bury them in the ground, confining them to obstruct each other. {7.4.101}</p>
<p>“He should visualize them</p>
<p>As two Vajrakrodhas fighting.</p>
<p>Visualizing in this way, the practitioner</p>
<p>Will be able to sow enmity between whomever he wants. {7.4.102}</p>
<p>“By visualizing the deity with the face of a horse</p>
<p>In conjunction with the syllable cī,</p>
<p>He will accomplish the ultimate</p>
<p>Drawing forth of wine [from the target’s stomach]. {7.4.103}</p>
<p>“The great king Hayagrīva</p>
<p>Is effectively the supreme master.</p>
<p>He is visualized as yellow-green,</p>
<p>With four faces and four hands. {7.4.104}</p>
<p>“His main face is dark green with a hint of yellow, and has three eyes. The faces on the right and left are black and white respectively. The upper face is that of a horse; it is yellow-green and terrible looking with bared fangs. With his first right hand he displays the mudrā of three outstretched fingers; in the second, he holds a double vajra scepter; in the third, a sword; and in the fourth, an arrow. In his first left hand he holds a multicolored lotus; in the second, a spear; in the third, a mirror; and in the fourth, a bow. He is standing on a sun disk with his left leg outstretched and the right slightly bent, and dancing the wild tāṇḍava dance, knocking down Viṣṇu, Śiva, and so forth. In this way should the follower of the mantra path meditate, following the right procedure. {7.4.105}</p>
<p>“In the target’s navel, he should visualize the syllable māṁ and, arising from it, the target with a belly full of wine. When he subsequently visualizes him as vomiting, the target will throw up wine. {7.4.106}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, the wise practitioner should walk toward the northwest and create there a maṇḍala with four corners. Using perfume, he should prepare seven drops and store them in an earthenware vessel. He should visualize that this transforms into Sumeru, with eight peaks arranged in a circle, surmounted with a flashing vajra scepter, with the seven seeds—yaṁ syllables—of wind inside it, confining thus the in-breath of the Great Indra in its interior, and marked at the top with the syllable laṁ. When this rite is performed in this way, he will stop the wind as if it were annihilated. {7.4.107}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should visualize an eight-petaled lotus, placing the eight nāgas on the petals, and a peacock, blazing with flames, in the center. Assuming the form of Vajrakrodha, he should squeeze the serpents with the heel of his foot, causing them to vomit rainclouds. Should he squeeze a nāga while reciting the syllable hūṁ in pairs, with the seed syllable of the nāgas thrown in between, he will cause rain to fall. {7.4.108}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should visualize in the sky a gaping mouth, as red as the light of the sun that causes the dissolution of the world. Its tongue, bright with the syllable hūṁ, licks the clouds filled with the seven waters, summoning them. Through its inhaling and exhaling, the mouth then scatters the clouds like tufts of cotton wool. He should then send forth a multitude of replicas of himself. He will instantly rend the sky and cause it to open, threatening it with the syllable hūṁ. {7.4.109}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should visualize Acalaceṭa with the color of an autumn sky, standing on a fiery disk, emerging from the center of [the practitioner’s] forehead. He is equal to Vairocana and has six hands which hold a sword, a noose, an arrow, a bow, a bell, and a vajra scepter. Sending down rain, and surrounded by countless Krodhavajras, he vanquishes Māras, frightens away all troublemakers, and destroys even the entire triple universe by filling it with the resonance of hūṁ. {7.4.110}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should sculpt a human effigy from human blood mixed with soil from the footprint of the target. He should nail it through the eyes with a spike made of human bone and incant it twenty times with the mantra of Mārīcī. Immediately after chanting the mantra, he should place the effigy in the mouth of an image of Gaṇapati and smash it from behind with a vajra cudgel, while repeating the mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, smother, smother! Reduce the obstacle makers to dust with your vajra cudgel! Hūṁ phaṭ!</p>
<p>“Through this meditative act he will instantly ward off human miscreants. {7.4.111}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should visualize the deity with silver-colored eyes, with his body adorned by hundreds of thousands of nāgas, issuing a command to the eight nāgas. These nāgas, for their part, should be visualized situated in the sky, with hundreds of thousands of faces. Upon hearing the command, they avert the rain with cloud masses. {7.4.112}</p>
<p>“As for the next rite, he should visualize a garuḍa blowing out fire by making wind with its wings, while creating a river with a stroke of its beak. Visualizing thus, he should recite the mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Vajranārāyaṇa! Extinguish the fire by bringing new water-bearing clouds! Hūṁ! {7.4.113}</p>
<p>“In the middle of the sky, [he should visualize Kurukullā Tārā] with three faces, each of them with three eyes. She is adorned with all types of jewelry and wears a tunic of tiger skin. She is red, intensely brilliant, with the same brightness as the rising sun. {7.4.114}</p>
<p>“She holds a sword, a khaṭvāṅga,</p>
<p>A bow, and an arrow,</p>
<p>As well as a skull cup with human flesh,</p>
<p>A ḍamaru, {7.4.115}</p>
<p>“A noose, and a goad.</p>
<p>[In her fifth pair of hands]</p>
<p>She is graced, in the left hand, with a lotus,</p>
<p>And displays the mudrā of fearlessness with the right. {7.4.116}</p>
<p>“Terrifying, she stands on a sun disk with her left leg outstretched and the right slightly bent,</p>
<p>Dancing the wild tāṇḍava dance, and enveloped in red flames.</p>
<p>[With her remaining pair of hands] she spreads above a canopy of a “great garment.”</p>
<p>She performs these acts in a charnel ground. {7.4.117}</p>
<p>“She is the goddess arising from the syllable hrīṁ,</p>
<p>Tārā, the one who delivers from saṃsāra.</p>
<p>By merely visualizing in this way,</p>
<p>The practitioner will attain awakening,</p>
<p>Not to mention other siddhis. {7.4.118}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wishes to enthrall someone, he should, on the eighth day of the first half of the month Caitra, go under the canopy of an aśoka tree and, dressed in red and adorned with all kinds of adornments, recite the mantra. He should visualize himself as red with three faces. Then, he should emanate from his body a two-armed red goddess with a goad and a noose in her hands. He should then visualize this goddess piercing the target through the heart with the goad and leading him into his own body. She makes him enter there in a state of confusion. In his heart one should place the ten-syllable mantra, visualized in red. He should further cause the target to enter, in his mental body form, into these syllables, and visualize him merging with them. Through this meditative method he will be able, after seven days, to enthrall even a universal monarch for as long as he lives—there is no doubt about this.” {7.4.119}</p>
<p>Now, to help ward off the dangers of lightning, the Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“He should visualize himself in the form of the glorious primordial lord with three faces, four feet, four arms, and a luminous red glow. He is surrounded by four goddesses whose names begin with [or include the word] vajra—they are Vajrāstrā, Vajrakelīkilā, Snehavajrā, and Vajragarvā. They each raise a vajra scepter with one of their right hands and hold an arrow with the other, proudly resting one of their left hands on the hip, while holding a bow with the other. He should visualize, emanating from the lord’s body, clouds composed of buddhas adorned with all kinds of jewelry. Staying in the middle of the sky, they display the gesture of fearlessness with their right hand, and hold a jeweled, dripping initiation vase with the other. Such will avert lightning. {7.4.120}</p>
<p>“The mantra to recite is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Mahāsukhavajratejaḥ! Hūṁ! {7.4.121}</p>
<p>“When the same rite involves binding sexual ecstasy, it is said to bring about the state of the highest yoga.” {7.4.122}</p>
<p>Concerning the rite of killing, the Blessed One taught the following:</p>
<p>“He should leave out the syllables used in the rite of pacifying,</p>
<p>Namely the final ya, the two ni syllables,</p>
<p>And then the middle ya syllable,</p>
<p>And use the remaining syllables as one likes. {7.4.123}</p>
<p>“By having explained such, O goddess,</p>
<p>All rites will be accomplished. {7.4.124}</p>
<p>“If he wants to enthrall a wanton woman, he should once again assume, on the eighth day of the bright fortnight, the identity of Kurukullā and do her meditation. He should consume a fruit of downy datura, and then respectfully give the target a tilaka on the forehead using juice of black nightshade. He should then recite the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, may such and such a woman, hrīṁ, become enthralled with me!</p>
<p>“When he has completed 10,000 recitations, she will arrive. {7.4.125}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wants to revive someone bitten by a black cobra, he should visualize in his heart an eight-petaled lotus, and above it, on each of the eight petals, distinctly visualize the third vowel (i), white in color. He should visualize himself in the form of the nāga Śeṣa, white in color and oozing ambrosia from the letter i [in his heart]. He should mentally send forth ambrosia from the two eyes of this nāga and visualize it falling into the body of the patient. By this meditative method he could neutralize the amount of poison that would fill the entire triple universe. {7.4.126}</p>
<p>“Now, if he wants to arrest the moon and the sun, he should make a moon and a sun from rice flour and submerge them in vajra water. He should recite the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, moon and sun! Do not move, do not move! Stop stop! Svāhā to Hevajra! {7.4.127}</p>
<p>“He should recite this mantra sixty million times and then commence the actual rite. The moon and the sun will stop in their tracks regardless of whether it is night or day. {7.4.128}</p>
<p>“If he wants to destroy an enemy army, he should procure a piece of chalk. Having ground the chalk, he should prepare a pill by adding the five ambrosias together with axe filings. {7.4.129}</p>
<p>“The mantra to repeat is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, vajra knife! Svāhā to Hevajra! {7.4.130}</p>
<p>“In order to ensure a successful outcome, he should recite this mantra ten million times. He will then succeed. Having completed the recitations, if he ties the aforementioned pill onto the neck of a pitcher and then breaks the neck, all the enemies will be decapitated. {7.4.131}</p>
<p>“Should he wish to cause [hostile] gods to burst, he should ritually prepare a tilaka compound. He should procure the ‘flower’ of a possessor of a vajra produced through constricting the vajra, mix it with axe filings, and grind this together with urine during a solar eclipse. Having ground them together, he should mold the paste into the shape of an axe and, stepping on it with his foot, recite the mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, vajra axe! Make them burst, do! Svāhā! {7.4.132}</p>
<p>“In order to ensure success, he should recite this mantra ten million times. Afterward, he should respectfully give the target a tilaka on the forehead. Whomever he does this to, will burst. {7.4.133}</p>
<p>“Now I will teach a rite for producing rain.</p>
<p>“He should make an effigy of Ananta according to the oṁ āḥ phuḥ ritual procedure, bathe it in the five ambrosias, and offer to it black flowers. Having smeared it with mugwort juice and inuncted its head with the rut fluid from the temples of an elephant, he should place it inside a double-chambered earthenware vessel, fill the vessel with milk from a black cow, and twine around it a cord spun by a black virgin. He should then dig a pond in an area toward the northwest and place Ananta next to it, by drawing a maṇḍala on its bank as prescribed and placing Ananta in its center. He should draw Hevajra standing astride Ananta, visualizing the former as having eight faces, four feet, sixteen arms, and, in all, twenty-four eyes. Later, the officiating master, in a proud and cruel frame of mind, should recite the following mantra in a secluded place: {7.4.134}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, rumble rumble! Ghaḍa ghaḍa! Destroy them, destroy! Strike, strike! O lord of nāgas who causes Ananta to tremble! He-he ru-ru ka! Summon the nāgas who dwell in the seven subterranean paradises and make them send rain! Threaten them and make them send thunder! Phuḥ phuḥ phuḥ puḥ phuḥ phuḥ phuḥ phuḥ!Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ! Svāhā! {7.4.135}</p>
<p>“If they do not send rain, he should recite the same mantra backward. They will then comply. If they still do not send rain, their heads will burst like a basil blossom. {7.4.136}</p>
<p>“If he wants to burst a cloud, he should write on a rag from a charnel ground the following mantra:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, threaten threaten! To the one fond of cemeteries, phaṭ svāhā!” {7.4.137}</p>
<p>This concludes the sovereign chapter called “The Benefits Derived from All the Rites and Their Meditations,” the seventh in the great tantra, the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa.”</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Vajragarbha said:</p>
<p>“I want to hear, O Blessed One,</p>
<p>About the attributes signified by other things.</p>
<p>I do not know the four principles,</p>
<p>So please explain them, O Blessed One.” {8.1.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajragarbha, how it really is regarding</p>
<p>The attributes of delivery from saṃsāra:</p>
<p>The vajra scepter signifies the first principle,</p>
<p>And the bell, the second. {8.1.2}</p>
<p>“The third is the rosary, and the fourth is</p>
<p>The attribute of knowledge.</p>
<p>The waves of these four principles</p>
<p>Carry beings to the desired other shore. {8.1.3}</p>
<p>“On the central prong of the vajra scepter is Lord Vairocana;</p>
<p>On the eastern, Akṣobhya himself.</p>
<p>Ratnasambhava is on the southern prong,</p>
<p>Whereas Amitābha should be visualized on the western. {8.1.4}</p>
<p>“On the northern prong there is Amoghasiddhi—</p>
<p>These are the main deities on the five prongs.</p>
<p>On the lotus below one should install, in their allotted places,</p>
<p>The eight bodhisattvas representing the eight ancillary aspects of awakening: {8.1.5}</p>
<p>“Padmapāṇi (Avalokiteśvara), Maitreya,</p>
<p>Gaganagañja (Ākāśagarbha), Samantabhadra,</p>
<p>The lord of yakṣas (Vajrapāṇi), Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Sarvanivaraṇaviṣkambhin, and Kṣitigarbha. {8.1.6}</p>
<p>“One should distribute these eight principal deities</p>
<p>In their respective places.</p>
<p>The wisdom deity is nestled</p>
<p>In the center, the place of origin of the thirteen deities. {8.1.7}</p>
<p>“On the other lotus petals one should add</p>
<p>The following eight goddesses in their respective places:</p>
<p>The four goddesses beginning with Vajrāṅkuśī in the cardinal directions,</p>
<p>And the other cavorting ladies in the intermediate directions. {8.1.8}</p>
<p>“On the five prongs of the vajra scepter there are five ḍākinīs:</p>
<p>On the central one, there is the eponymous jñānasattva—Jñānaḍākinī;</p>
<p>On the eastern, there is Vajraḍākinī;</p>
<p>On the northern, there is the one called Ghorī; {8.1.9}</p>
<p>“On the western one, there is Vetālī;</p>
<p>And Caṇḍālī is the goddess on the southern prong.</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should know</p>
<p>These deities to be the principles of the vajra. {8.1.10}</p>
<p>“Since the principles of the vajra are present</p>
<p>As the nature of the vajra within one’s own mind,</p>
<p>The practitioners, by employing the vajra scepters,</p>
<p>Can bring on the realization of the vajra mind. {8.1.11}</p>
<p>“He should firmly ascertain that vajra is purity;</p>
<p>This vajra [mind] is construed as identical with phenomena.</p>
<p>Vajra is all of these principles,</p>
<p>And it extends also to ritual action. {8.1.12}</p>
<p>“The vajra scepter, by emitting light,</p>
<p>Delivers beings from saṃsāra.</p>
<p>He who knows the method can use it</p>
<p>In the acts of summoning and paralyzing. {8.1.13}</p>
<p>“Just as the afflictions are likened to darkness,</p>
<p>So does gnosis accord with a lamp.</p>
<p>Should he destroy the afflictions with the vajra of gnosis,</p>
<p>He will attain the dimension of light. {8.1.14}</p>
<p>“Everything that is accomplished with the vajra</p>
<p>Is taught to be the nature of vajra.</p>
<p>Vajra is the essence of phenomena;</p>
<p>Vajra is being concerned with liberation. {8.1.15}</p>
<p>“By mounting the vajra onto the lotus</p>
<p>He will realize the nature of reality in its entirety.</p>
<p>By submerging the vajra in the lotus,</p>
<p>The wise practitioner will succeed. {8.1.16}</p>
<p>“Listen, O King Vajradhara, about</p>
<p>The characteristics of the vajra bell.</p>
<p>All the deities listen to the bells,</p>
<p>Whose very nature is to sound wisdom. {8.1.17}</p>
<p>“The bell should be clearly understood as consisting of three parts.</p>
<p>It is adorned with a girding band;</p>
<p>It is as tranquil as the blossoms of blue or white lotuses,</p>
<p>And arrayed with jewels and lotus flowers. {8.1.18}</p>
<p>“[On the nine-pronged vajra handle] there are eight deities</p>
<p>In the cardinal and intermediate directions, with the Buddha as the ninth in the center.</p>
<p>As there are nine deities, and so forth,</p>
<p>He should consecrate the prongs with these nine. {8.1.19}</p>
<p>“Eight of the prongs emerge from the mouth of a sea monster</p>
<p>And are each situated on light rays and a moon.</p>
<p>This is the vajra scepter of wisdom that liberates the world;</p>
<p>It is called ‘The Nine Prongs.’ {8.1.20}</p>
<p>“Established as the seat of awakening,</p>
<p>It is present throughout the reaches of space,</p>
<p>With all the infinite world spheres</p>
<p>Throughout the ten directions being fields of knowledge. {8.1.21}</p>
<p>“[On the petals of the lotus at the top of the bell],</p>
<p>In the eight directions, eight goddesses are famed to reside.</p>
<p>They arise from their respective seed syllables</p>
<p>And are each placed in one of the eight sectors. {8.1.22}</p>
<p>“On the eastern petal there is Tāriṇī;</p>
<p>On the northern, there is Pāṇḍarā.</p>
<p>On the western, there is Māmakī,</p>
<p>And on the southern, there is Buddhalocanā. {8.1.23}</p>
<p>“The intermediate directions are occupied by Sauvarṇā,</p>
<p>Madhurā, Kānti, and Vajramālā—the four of them.</p>
<p>Inside they are like space,</p>
<p>And outwardly they are receptacles of beauty and radiance. {8.1.24}</p>
<p>“They each arise from a lotus in full bloom.</p>
<p>[Inside the bell,] resembling a vase of wisdom ambrosia,</p>
<p>Is the place of formless existence.</p>
<p>In the center of this place of wisdom ambrosia is the mind. {8.1.25}</p>
<p>“The bell is the goddess Prajñāpāramitā,</p>
<p>Beautiful in form and endowed with qualities.</p>
<p>As for the vajra [prongs] above the lotus,</p>
<p>He should visualize there the set of deities as before. {8.1.26}</p>
<p>“The middle part is called ‘the staff of gnosis’—</p>
<p>There takes place all emanating and absorbing.</p>
<p>He should cause the bell clapper to swing in the eight directions,</p>
<p>Employing the visualization of the vowels and consonants. {8.1.27}</p>
<p>“Through this method involving the vowels and the consonants</p>
<p>He can cut through all of saṃsāric existence.</p>
<p>The vajra scepter and bell are means,</p>
<p>And as means, they are in the middle. {8.1.28}</p>
<p>“Stretching out both hands, he should, in this ritual,</p>
<p>Perform the gesture of ‘the turning of the lotus’ five times.</p>
<p>On his right palm he should visualize the sun,</p>
<p>And on his left, the moon. {8.1.29}</p>
<p>“As the skillful means for embodied beings,</p>
<p>He should visualize his chosen deity.</p>
<p>The wise practitioner should raise up the vajra scepter</p>
<p>And then place it upon the bell. {8.1.30}</p>
<p>“He should chant the syllable hūṁ</p>
<p>And delight all the buddhas by singing:</p>
<p>“ ‘Adorned by the raised vajra scepter,</p>
<p>Delusional beings are liberated.</p>
<p>As the fruition of liberation through Dharma,</p>
<p>One holds the pleasing vajra scepter.</p>
<p>“ ‘Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Ho ho ho!’ {8.1.31}</p>
<p>“When sounding the wisdom and the means (i.e., the bell and the vajra scepter)</p>
<p>The wisdom and the means consist of his hands. {8.1.32}</p>
<p>“He should recite further:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, the vajra sound of phenomena! Spreading and reverberating! You reach all the buddhafields. Your nature is the sound of the perfection of wisdom. You delight the heart of Vajrasattva. Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Ho ho ho! Svāhā! {8.1.33}</p>
<p>“And further:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, please stand by the vajra pledge to bring about the realization of all the tathāgatas! I uphold you. Hiḥ hi hi hi hi! Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ! Svāhā! {8.1.34}</p>
<p>“By the Dharma of wisdom and means</p>
<p>All living beings are awakened.</p>
<p>He should sound the bell in order to awaken to buddhahood</p>
<p>Those beings wallowing in the swamp of unknowing. {8.1.35}</p>
<p>“He should truly grasp the vajra scepter,</p>
<p>And truly sound the bell.</p>
<p>Being a practitioner, he should work for the benefit of beings,</p>
<p>Following the procedure of wisdom and means. {8.1.36}</p>
<p>“The bell of the practitioner who does not have</p>
<p>This truth in his heart sounds like an elephant bell.</p>
<p>The accomplishment of someone who does not</p>
<p>Possess the truth of yoga appears to be far off.” {8.1.37}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the eighth chapter on the principles of the bell.</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajragarbha, as is proper,</p>
<p>About the characteristics of a rosary,</p>
<p>By the correct application of which,</p>
<p>One will succeed without doubt. {8.2.1}</p>
<p>“Crystal, pearl,</p>
<p>Bone, or another white material</p>
<p>Are the characteristics of a rosary</p>
<p>Particularly suited for rites of appeasement. {8.2.2}</p>
<p>“Gold, silver, or copper,</p>
<p>And, in particular, lotus seeds,</p>
<p>Are regarded by a wise practitioner</p>
<p>As the rosary materials for rites of enriching. {8.2.3}</p>
<p>“Saffron, sandalwood, and similar substances,</p>
<p>Or any especially fragrant materials,</p>
<p>Should be used for making beads</p>
<p>Famed to be effective in rites of enthralling. {8.2.4}</p>
<p>“Rudrākṣa seeds, soapberry seeds,</p>
<p>And human bone</p>
<p>Should be used in violent rites,</p>
<p>As they are famed to be effective in assaulting. {8.2.5}</p>
<p>“The seeds of lucky bean tree can be used in all rites—</p>
<p>Pacifying, enriching, enthralling, and assaulting.</p>
<p>For the accomplishment of the mantra the number of beads should be fifty;</p>
<p>In rites of enthralling, it should be half of that. {8.2.6}</p>
<p>“For rites of pacifying, there should be one hundred beads;</p>
<p>In rites of enriching, one hundred and eight.</p>
<p>In rites of assaulting, there should be sixty—</p>
<p>These are the numbers used in specific rites. {8.2.7}</p>
<p>“One should prepare a rosary and other implements</p>
<p>According to the type of ritual being performed.</p>
<p>With eight deities in the cardinal and intermediary directions,</p>
<p>And the Buddha being the ninth in the center, {8.2.8}</p>
<p>“One should install the nine deities</p>
<p>In the nine-threaded cord of the nine deities, and so forth.</p>
<p>All of the beads are arhats—</p>
<p>They should be threaded above the stūpa-bead. {8.2.9}</p>
<p>“The stūpa-bead is regarded as the beholder of phenomena,</p>
<p>And the beads above it, the sphere of phenomena.</p>
<p>One should visualize on the palm of one’s [right] hand a sun disk</p>
<p>With the first vowel, a, and so forth. {8.2.10}</p>
<p>“If one is a practitioner, he should visualize in the center of the [left] hand</p>
<p>The syllable of ambrosia, a,</p>
<p>With a white central part,</p>
<p>Radiating multiple rays of light. {8.2.11}</p>
<p>“He should visualize the fingers of the right hand as the prongs of a vajra scepter,</p>
<p>And the fingers of the left as lotus petals.</p>
<p>He should join the lotus with the vajra to form a hemisphere,</p>
<p>And place the rosary in the center. {8.2.12}</p>
<p>“He should visualize this as completely real,</p>
<p>And consecrate the rosary in this way.</p>
<p>Afterward, the mantra practitioner should recite the mantras,</p>
<p>According to the specifics of how to use his fingers, and so forth. {8.2.13}</p>
<p>“The [left] hand then also becomes vajra,</p>
<p>Assuming the nature of nonduality of the vajra.</p>
<p>In rites of pacifying he should use the index finger;</p>
<p>In those of enriching, he employs the principle of the middle finger. {8.2.14}</p>
<p>“The ring finger is said to be used in rites of enthralling,</p>
<p>And the little finger in rites of assaulting.</p>
<p>The thumb is used to form a vajra hook</p>
<p>With the power to summon the deities. {8.2.15}</p>
<p>“By reciting and meditating with focus,</p>
<p>He will succeed without a doubt.</p>
<p>When the practitioner does not possess suchness,</p>
<p>His mantra recitation and meditation will be, likewise, without suchness. {8.2.16}</p>
<p>“He will lack the principles of the vajra scepter and bell,</p>
<p>And likewise will not give rise to the principle of gesture.</p>
<p>However, once the practitioner attains suchness,</p>
<p>He will be able to manifest all principles. {8.2.17}</p>
<p>“Since suchness is the cause of all syllables,</p>
<p>It is also the essence of mantras with exquisite forms.</p>
<p>Thus by counting the mantras that are meant to be counted,</p>
<p>He will realize the essence of the yoginīs. {8.2.18}</p>
<p>“The mantra to recite is:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, stage by stage, I will attain the great knowledge of all the buddhas. Hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ! Ho ho ho! Aḥ! Svāhā! {8.2.19}</p>
<p>“By reciting these mantras that purify through the principle of the rosary,</p>
<p>He will accomplish whatever he desires.</p>
<p>The rites rooted in suchness will be successful.</p>
<p>But if suchness is not fully manifested, success will be far off. {8.2.20}</p>
<p>“Listen well, O [Vajragarbha], one of great knowledge,</p>
<p>As this is particularly about the essential reality of wisdom.</p>
<p>Fully collected, he should offer a gaṇacakra feast,</p>
<p>Assuming, as the mental categories go, the mind of sameness. {8.2.21}</p>
<p>“He should visualize, transformed from the seed syllable of gnosis</p>
<p>Placed in the center of a moon disk,</p>
<p>[Vairocana], white in color</p>
<p>And sitting on a lotus throne. {8.2.22}</p>
<p>“He has two arms and sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture;</p>
<p>He is adorned with all kinds of jewelry.</p>
<p>His consort, the great seal,</p>
<p>Is held to his heart with his two hands. {8.2.23}</p>
<p>“Brilliantly white and very beautiful,</p>
<p>She resembles the noble lord Vairocana.</p>
<p>With clouds composed of buddhas flashing forth,</p>
<p>He is surrounded on all sides by multicolored light. {8.2.24}</p>
<p>“Simultaneously, he should recite the mantra</p>
<p>Following the right procedure, which involves</p>
<p>Turning the rosary with either the left or the right hand.</p>
<p>This will please the ḍākinīs. {8.2.25}</p>
<p>“The seeds of vowels and consonants</p>
<p>Are threaded on the thread whose principle is the syllable hūṁ.</p>
<p>Should the practitioner visualize this seed syllable [of Vairocana],</p>
<p>He will swiftly attain buddhahood.” {8.2.26}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the eighth chapter on mantra recitation and visualization.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>“Listen Vajragarbha, as is proper, to the explanation</p>
<p>Of the practice of consciousness transference.</p>
<p>I will teach you about the beautiful destiny</p>
<p>Arrived at through the auspicious path of practitioners. {8.3.1}</p>
<p>[Vajragarbha said:]</p>
<p>“I want to hear it, O master of gnosis!</p>
<p>What are the nine gates?</p>
<p>What are the good qualities and faults,</p>
<p>According to the classification of the gates of consciousness?” {8.3.2}</p>
<p>[The Blessed One said:]</p>
<p>“Listen about the proper method,</p>
<p>Which is to be relied upon at the time of passing away.</p>
<p>When the path is right, one will reach a pleasant destiny;</p>
<p>The wrong path will lead to unfavorable forms of existence. {8.3.3}</p>
<p>“The nine gates are specified as</p>
<p>The ‘drop’ between the eyebrows, the navel,</p>
<p>The fontanelle above, the eyes, the nostrils and so forth, the ears,</p>
<p>And the gates for passing water and for evacuation. {8.3.4}</p>
<p>“The gate at the navel leads to the gods’ realm of desire.</p>
<p>By leaving through the ‘drop,’ one will enter the realm of form.</p>
<p>The ‘above’ gate leads to still higher destinies.</p>
<p>These three gates have been proclaimed as leading to higher destinies. {8.3.5}</p>
<p>“The realm of yakṣas is entered through the nostrils;</p>
<p>That of the divine siddhas, through the ears.</p>
<p>The consciousness that escapes through the eyes</p>
<p>Will proceed to the realm of humans. {8.3.6}</p>
<p>“The gate of existence, the mouth, leads to the realm of hungry ghosts,</p>
<p>While the urinary passage leads to the animal realm.</p>
<p>When the gate is the anus, the destiny is hell with its eight divisions.</p>
<p>So are described, O sons of noble family, the passages into different existences. {8.3.7}</p>
<p>“Since the emergence of the different saṃsāric destinations</p>
<p>Happens according to the specificities of the gates,</p>
<p>The practitioners must focus [at the time of death]</p>
<p>On the type of gate they are going to pass through. {8.3.8}</p>
<p>“When the time of death arrives,</p>
<p>A sign of death will be perceived.</p>
<p>It is best to practice transference</p>
<p>Before the separation of body and mind is caused by old age, and so forth. {8.3.9}</p>
<p>“To start, one should block all the gates</p>
<p>By performing the breath retention called kumbhaka.</p>
<p>The visualization involves five syllables placed inside the subtle channels,</p>
<p>[Each of the syllables blocking one of] the five gate-orifices. {8.3.10}</p>
<p>“The seed syllable at the gate below them</p>
<p>Should be white as the element water.</p>
<p>The seed syllable of fire at the urethral and anal gates</p>
<p>Should be visualized as blazing like fire. {8.3.11}</p>
<p>“One should do this visualization with complete collectedness</p>
<p>While performing the same breathing as mentioned before.</p>
<p>One’s body is visualized as being the color of the element wind,</p>
<p>And the consciousness as being the maṇḍala of wind. {8.3.12}</p>
<p>“The roots of the seed syllable of wind (yūṁ)</p>
<p>Are rooted in the edges of the wind below.</p>
<p>One should pull [the consciousness] with the visualized syllables,</p>
<p>Each joined with the ‘sound’ (u) and the anunāsika. {8.3.13}</p>
<p>“One should attach the hook of Ghorā (kṣuṁ),</p>
<p>And so forth, to the syllable of Vajrī (suṁ).</p>
<p>One should imagine Ghorā pulling [the consciousness]</p>
<p>Through the twenty-four places in the ten directions. {8.3.14}</p>
<p>“It should be drawn upward from its resting place, one step at a time,</p>
<p>Through the nine junctures, until it reaches the top point (i.e., the fontanelle).</p>
<p>With the seed syllable at the tuft of ūrṇā,</p>
<p>One should purify the syllable(s) of the body. {8.3.15}</p>
<p>“One should pronounce, with a terrible sound (i),</p>
<p>The final syllable of the eight (ha).</p>
<p>It should be joined with the half-syllable</p>
<p>Of the first ferocious letter of the first ferocious group (k). {8.3.16}</p>
<p>“One should propel [the consciousness with]</p>
<p>The wind-syllable below by repeating the sound (hik).</p>
<p>Joined with the syllable of wind (yuṁ)</p>
<p>As the maṇḍala of wind, {8.3.17}</p>
<p>“The consciousness should be propelled upward</p>
<p>Through the twenty-four places, higher and higher.</p>
<p>If the practitioner should start greying,</p>
<p>He should consume the ‘upper letter.’ {8.3.18}</p>
<p>“When the consciousness reaches the highest</p>
<p>Of the nine junctions, it suddenly escapes upward.</p>
<p>Even if one has killed a god or a brahmin,</p>
<p>Or committed one of the five sins of instant retribution, {8.3.19}</p>
<p>“Engaged in stealing, or indulged in the pleasures of the senses,</p>
<p>One will be liberated by this method.</p>
<p>Untainted by past sins, one will be far removed</p>
<p>From the shortcomings of cyclic existence. {8.3.20}</p>
<p>“Just as the beauty of a lotus,</p>
<p>Growing out of mud, is completely immaculate,</p>
<p>So will the wisdom-body be, through one’s own will,</p>
<p>When propelled from bodies of mud and the like. {8.3.21}</p>
<p>“The transference can be performed only when the time has arrived;</p>
<p>Otherwise it is equal to the slaying of a god.</p>
<p>Therefore the wise practitioner should commence</p>
<p>This practice only when the body has manifested signs of death. {8.3.22}</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajra, about this practice particularly important to accomplish,</p>
<p>Explained in conformity with the truth.</p>
<p>One should visualize, with the mind in the state of equanimity</p>
<p>And with all the characteristics as previously described, {8.3.23}</p>
<p>“In one’s heart, in the center of the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>The syllable of the five buddhas.</p>
<p>Bright as the sun, it emits light rays</p>
<p>Whose nature is reflected by the mind. {8.3.24}</p>
<p>“Following the previous instructions on emptiness</p>
<p>And the accompanying characteristics,</p>
<p>One should break up all forms, and so forth,</p>
<p>With the mind abiding as the syllable hūṁ. {8.3.25}</p>
<p>“From this seed syllable one generates</p>
<p>The form of the deity in the center of a moon disk,</p>
<p>Sitting on a lotus seat—one should thus</p>
<p>Visualize oneself as Jñānaḍākinī. {8.3.26}</p>
<p>“She has three faces and six arms.</p>
<p>Each face has three eyes and each head is adorned with a diadem.</p>
<p>She displays the sentiments of mirth, anger, and erotic love,</p>
<p>And is adorned with all types of jewelry. {8.3.27}</p>
<p>“Her color is white like jasmine flowers or the moon,</p>
<p>And she is dressed in very beautiful clothes.</p>
<p>She sits in the sattvaparyaṅka posture</p>
<p>Surrounded by clouds of buddhas flashing rays of light. {8.3.28}</p>
<p>“In her first [right] hand she holds an arrow,</p>
<p>And in the second, a goad.</p>
<p>In her third hand, she brandishes a vajra scepter.</p>
<p>With her first left hand she makes a threatening gesture and holds a noose. {8.3.29}</p>
<p>“In the second, she holds a wish-fulfilling creeper;</p>
<p>With the third, she raises a bow nocked with an arrow.</p>
<p>Around her there are multiple halos of light.</p>
<p>One should visualize all this with the breath unmoving. {8.3.30}</p>
<p>“One should then place the letters on her body,</p>
<p>Forming with them the eight seed syllables,</p>
<p>Just as such syllables are formed—</p>
<p>Through combining the vowels and the consonants. {8.3.31}</p>
<p>“All of them are white</p>
<p>And suffused with moonlight.</p>
<p>In her heart, on a lotus in the center of a plantain flower,</p>
<p>One should place the universe. {8.3.32}</p>
<p>“In its center one should visualize</p>
<p>The consciousness combined with gnosis.</p>
<p>Unwavering and untroubled,</p>
<p>One should meditate merging with the essence. {8.3.33}</p>
<p>“Then the wise practitioner should observe</p>
<p>The external practices related to</p>
<p>Reading the thoughts of others in different places,</p>
<p>By employing the mind as the maṇḍala of wind. {8.3.34}</p>
<p>“In the center of the maṇḍala of wind is the maṇḍala of fire.</p>
<p>In the center of the maṇḍala of fire is a sun disk.</p>
<p>It is decked with the vowels and the consonants, which transform into</p>
<p>A sun and a moon respectively, with a red seed syllable between them. {8.3.35}</p>
<p>“It is particularly recommended that the practitioner</p>
<p>Combines the recitation of the mantra with exhaling and inhaling.</p>
<p>With the outgoing breath he should strike the target</p>
<p>In the center of his body with the syllable of gnosis (hūṁ). {8.3.36}</p>
<p>“When inhaling, the one reciting the mantra</p>
<p>In combination with exhaling and inhaling</p>
<p>Should strike, as if with a flower,</p>
<p>The gnosis at his heart. {8.3.37}</p>
<p>“By reciting in combination with exhalation and inhalation,</p>
<p>The practitioner externalizes his nature.</p>
<p>He should observe the characteristics of exhalation,</p>
<p>And observe the characteristics of inhalation. {8.3.38}</p>
<p>“This practice of exhaling and inhaling</p>
<p>Involves the cultivation of the state of equality.</p>
<p>Through merging thus with the essence while fully collected,</p>
<p>He will reach accomplishment, there is no doubt. {8.3.39}</p>
<p>“Then the external bodies of others will become</p>
<p>The practitioner’s own magical manifestation.</p>
<p>Reading the thoughts of others,</p>
<p>The wise one will be able to reveal them. {8.3.40}</p>
<p>“If, with his mind fully immersed</p>
<p>In the visualization and recitation as specified,</p>
<p>He thinks of positive migrations,</p>
<p>This will be achieved without doubt. {8.3.41}</p>
<p>“Therefore, having become the nature of gnosis, the wise practitioner should perform the rites with his mind blazing brightly like a lamp. {8.3.42}</p>
<p>“The suchness as experienced by hearers, and so forth,</p>
<p>Has been skillfully presented and explained.</p>
<p>Having first, as a listener, stabilized the crystal-like mind</p>
<p>Until it blazes forth like a lamp, {8.3.43}</p>
<p>“He should observe his every conceptual elaboration</p>
<p>Until conceptuality becomes nonconceptual.</p>
<p>Relying thus on the method of the innate nature,</p>
<p>He should completely discard all concepts.” {8.3.44}</p>
<p>[The goddess asked], “Venerable One! How is the [mundane] consciousness differentiated?” {8.3.45}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Consciousness is said to be fivefold: {8.3.46}</p>
<p>“(1) The secret mirror-consciousness of the gods,</p>
<p>(2) The anger-consciousness of the demigods,</p>
<p>(3) The wretched consciousness of the hungry spirits,</p>
<p>(4) The ‘screaming in fear’ consciousness of hell beings, {8.3.47}</p>
<p>“And (5) the deluded consciousness of animals.</p>
<p>Inanimate objects and the like do not possess consciousness.</p>
<p>So is the consciousness taught following this fivefold division. {8.3.48}</p>
<p>“The immature consciousness of dumb beings</p>
<p>Who are obscured by dullness</p>
<p>May be elevated in its essence</p>
<p>Thanks to the excellence of yoga treatises. {8.3.49}</p>
<p>“It is once in a thousand million lifetimes</p>
<p>That, because of me, one becomes inspired by gnosis.</p>
<p>Therefore the wise one should generate faith with ardor</p>
<p>And diligently study yoga treatises. {8.3.50}</p>
<p>“The words, and so forth, of the outer treatises</p>
<p>Are like the makeup of a dancer.</p>
<p>He should therefore strive to attain fulfilment and liberation</p>
<p>Through pursuing the teachings of yoga tantra. {8.3.51}</p>
<p>“Yoga tantra, more essential than the essence itself,</p>
<p>Has been taught to you, O fair-faced one.” {8.3.52}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the eighth chapter, called “The Rejection of the Knowledge of Non-Buddhists.”</p>
<p>Part 4</p>

<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Now the great bodhisattvas, headed by Vajragarbha, along with all the tathāgatas, made offerings and prostrated themselves to the Blessed One, then said: {9.1.1}</p>
<p>“Please give us, O Blessed One, O divine being,</p>
<p>A detailed exposition of the state of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>In which place does one abide,</p>
<p>Playing within the animate and inanimate universes?” {9.1.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Listen! I will explain the nature of</p>
<p>The mind fixating on concepts as it really is.</p>
<p>This nature, which has already been taught earlier,</p>
<p>Is always present in everybody. {9.1.3}</p>
<p>“The body is said to be the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>With four doors, as has been described.</p>
<p>In the navel center there is a great lotus,</p>
<p>Which is famed to be the seat of omniscient gnosis. {9.1.4}</p>
<p>“In that place dwells the valiant one.</p>
<p>Without constituent parts he is indivisible.</p>
<p>He plays within embodied beings, being himself</p>
<p>Beyond any embodiment and completely pure. {9.1.5}</p>
<p>“Possessed of the great magical power of all the buddhas,</p>
<p>He can magically transform himself—</p>
<p>Sometimes into the great bodhicitta,</p>
<p>Sometimes into the conduct that accompanies it. {9.1.6}</p>
<p>“Sometimes he dwells among the gods of the Tuṣita realm.</p>
<p>At some point he makes the supreme descent to earth.</p>
<p>At some point he takes a pure birth,</p>
<p>And at some point he definitively renounces worldly life. {9.1.7}</p>
<p>“At some point he makes a great peregrination for the sake of awakening,</p>
<p>And at some point he defeats Māra.</p>
<p>At some point he attains complete and perfect awakening,</p>
<p>And at some point he turns the wheel of Dharma. {9.1.8}</p>
<p>“At some point he defeats in debate the followers of other creeds,</p>
<p>Using in his arguments truths acceptable to both parties.</p>
<p>At some point he becomes the master of all attainments,</p>
<p>And at some point he conquers the triple universe. {9.1.9}</p>
<p>“At some point he attains the unexcelled powers</p>
<p>Of accomplishment that last throughout all the ages.</p>
<p>Such infinite and supreme acts as these and others</p>
<p>Are performed by those partaking of the nature of all buddhas, {9.1.10}</p>
<p>“Since they are free from both existence and nonexistence.</p>
<p>Thus, one should abandon all delusion.</p>
<p>‘The set of vowels is the bee,’ they say;</p>
<p>The bee is Vajrabhairava. {9.1.11}</p>
<p>“The set of vowels extends to the end of space,</p>
<p>Since by its nature it is the sphere of phenomena.</p>
<p>It is the secret container of animate and inanimate elements</p>
<p>Of every being that has evolved a body. {9.1.12}</p>
<p>“It is the ‘ambrosia’ of the aggregates, the sense-fields, and the elements</p>
<p>That constitutes all their vital power.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should draw all the ambrosia inward</p>
<p>And dissolve it in the middle of the root. {9.1.13}</p>
<p>“With the vajra sound of Bhairava,</p>
<p>Taking the form of the fluid of the completion yoga,</p>
<p>One should join the seven winds and fires</p>
<p>With the syllable of Vajrī. {9.1.14}</p>
<p>“Surmounted with the anunāsika, this seed syllable</p>
<p>Is known as ‘the torrent of rain.’</p>
<p>One should hold at the center of the [lotus at the navel]</p>
<p>The first and original vowel (a). {9.1.15}</p>
<p>“The consonant syllabary (kāli) is the flower king;</p>
<p>The flower is the body of vajra holders.</p>
<p>It is the origin of cyclic existence for all</p>
<p>And the mother all over the earth. {9.1.16}</p>
<p>“In that ocean with the water of gnosis</p>
<p>There are sea monsters and fishes of insight.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the swamp of nonduality</p>
<p>Sprouts the sprout of skillful means. {9.1.17}</p>
<p>“This receptacle of honey and ambrosia</p>
<p>Resembles an open bandhūka flower.</p>
<p>The mixing of consonants with the ambrosia</p>
<p>Is like the mixing of ‘flower’ and ‘water.’ {9.1.18}</p>
<p>“Since the body is born from both the blood and the semen,</p>
<p>The method of ‘ambrosia-water’ is supreme.</p>
<p>The ‘ambrosia-water’ is said initially</p>
<p>To have a fivefold nature. {9.1.19}</p>
<p>“Fire imparts its heat through contact,</p>
<p>Wind is perceived as smoke,</p>
<p>Water has the nature of fluidity,</p>
<p>And because of the element earth, shapes can be discerned. {9.1.20}</p>
<p>“Wisdom consecrated by the vajra</p>
<p>Becomes fivefold.</p>
<p>To elaborate, water can assume every shape;</p>
<p>Fire, for its part, brings destruction; {9.1.21}</p>
<p>“Wind is the continual breathing;</p>
<p>And earth, for its part, is the nature of the witness.</p>
<p>All the yoginīs are pleased</p>
<p>With the song in the form of the syllable hūṁ. {9.1.22}</p>
<p>“By chanting the following song, one will become a son of the victorious ones.</p>
<p>“ ‘O vajra, lord of bliss,</p>
<p>Who perceives with the five eyes!</p>
<p>You are the nature of letters</p>
<p>Who plays in emptiness. {9.1.23}</p>
<p>“ ‘Being devoid of existence and nonexistence,</p>
<p>You are known as the essence.</p>
<p>May you destroy all letters</p>
<p>And all thoughts. {9.1.24}</p>
<p>“ ‘The practitioner of the coupling embrace,</p>
<p>Performed for the purpose of producing the fluids,</p>
<p>Attains the nondual Dharma,</p>
<p>Which, quintessentially, is liberation. {9.1.25}</p>
<p>“ ‘For the sake of those deluded by the pleasures of saṃsāra</p>
<p>You forestall your own liberation.</p>
<p>In the nature of emptiness</p>
<p>You play with the mantra of the yoginīs. {9.1.26}</p>
<p>“ ‘You show that the five yoginīs</p>
<p>Are in reality the five buddhas.</p>
<p>With magical displays of manifold forms</p>
<p>You bring beings to spiritual maturity. {9.1.27}</p>
<p>“ ‘The purpose of extending the vajra</p>
<p>Is to remove delusion about phenomena.</p>
<p>May you bow to this teaching, good in its essence,</p>
<p>For the sake of liberating the yoginīs.’ {9.1.28}</p>
<p>“By chanting this song, O sons of noble family, one will become a son of all the victorious ones—so said every blessed tathāgata.” {9.1.29}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the ninth chapter, “The Genesis of Every Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajragarbha, O mighty king,</p>
<p>About how to do the oblation ritual according to procedure.</p>
<p>One should delineate a circle of red sandalwood paste</p>
<p>Measuring one cubit in diameter, {9.2.1}</p>
<p>“And then draw a white triangle surrounding it. Along with the honors such as the welcome offering of water and flowers and the five articles—fish, meat, and so forth—one should include wine that inspires amorous passion. On the left side one should place all the ritual implements, and on the right, a dish with water. In front there should be the welcome-offering dish. Having purified all these substances with the five ambrosias, one should enter the absorption of Vajrasattva or, alternatively, assume the identity of Heruka. {9.2.2}</p>
<p>“One should summon the wisdom ambrosia</p>
<p>By means of gesture and mantras, observing the ritual procedure.</p>
<p>One should offer red flowers,</p>
<p>Lamps, and so on, and also perfume. {9.2.3}</p>
<p>“One should mentally summon all five ambrosias</p>
<p>To the lotus dish marked with the syllable oṁ,</p>
<p>In particular through hūṁ, the principle of the tongue,</p>
<p>According to the divisions of the hooks of gnosis.” {9.2.4}</p>
<p>[Vajragarbha asked:]</p>
<p>“What, O Blessed One, are the so-called ‘hooks of gnosis’?” {9.2.5}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Prajāpati is said to be the first one.</p>
<p>The second in this listing is Tārā.</p>
<p>Pravarā is thought to be the third.</p>
<p>The fourth is Bahulojātā.</p>
<p>The fifth is Bālā.</p>
<p>“These names are mantras of the five families, following the division of the five wisdoms. {9.2.6}</p>
<p>“These five great gnoses</p>
<p>Have been taught for your benefit.</p>
<p>One should employ them in all activities,</p>
<p>Following the division into the five ‘hooks of gnosis.’ {9.2.7}</p>
<p>“Should one wish these activities to occur incessantly,</p>
<p>One should please all the yoginīs,</p>
<p>But without sexual addiction;</p>
<p>One should not become attached to bliss. {9.2.8}</p>
<p>“In order to benefit all beings, the practitioner</p>
<p>Should arrange offerings of every kind.</p>
<p>That which is famed as the moon</p>
<p>Arises out of the thirteen vowels. {9.2.9}</p>
<p>“Then, in the center of the moon, he should gratify all the deities with syllables, by uniting the vowels and the consonants. {9.2.10}</p>
<p>“He should generate a blaze of light</p>
<p>Distinguished by the arising of heat.</p>
<p>He should visualize it in the form of a crystal</p>
<p>And then distribute all of it. {9.2.11}</p>
<p>“Having extracted the ambrosia in its center,</p>
<p>He should have [the lord of the maṇḍala and his retinue] taste of it.</p>
<p>And with all the other articles, such as the remainder of ambrosia,</p>
<p>He should satiate the members of the outer maṇḍala. {9.2.12}</p>
<p>“Holding the skull cup with the left hand,</p>
<p>He should display the gesture of wrath with the right.</p>
<p>With feet wide apart and upward gaze,</p>
<p>The syllable pheṭ should emerge from his head. {9.2.13}</p>
<p>“Making his offerings on the fourteenth day,</p>
<p>Or especially the eighth day, of the dark fortnight,</p>
<p>Or also on the tenth day of the bright fortnight,</p>
<p>He should himself become the inner offerings. {9.2.14}</p>
<p>“Under solitary trees, in charnel grounds,</p>
<p>Mountains, wilderness,</p>
<p>Caves, outskirts of villages,</p>
<p>Empty fields, or, especially, in empty houses— {9.2.15}</p>
<p>“In particular, in places containing living beings,</p>
<p>On dry land as well as on water—</p>
<p>He should invoke Black Rudra and Great Rudra</p>
<p>In union with their consort goddesses; {9.2.16}</p>
<p>“Black Kapālin, Bībhatsa,</p>
<p>Nandātīta and Vināyaka;</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī, Ghorarūpā,</p>
<p>And Umādevī, in places all around; {9.2.17}</p>
<p>“Jayā, Vijayā,</p>
<p>Ajitā and Aparājitā;</p>
<p>Bhadrakālī, Mahākālī,</p>
<p>And the yoginī Śūlakālī; {9.2.18}</p>
<p>“Indrī, Candrī, Ghorī, Duṣṭī,</p>
<p>Lampakī, Tridaśeśvarī,</p>
<p>Kambojī, Dipinī, Cūṣaṇī,</p>
<p>And the yoginīs dwelling in villages. {9.2.19}</p>
<p>“All these goddesses have terrible, huge forms.</p>
<p>Baring their formidable fangs, they each wear a garland of human skulls</p>
<p>And hold khaṭvāṅgas in their hands.</p>
<p>They are all endowed with great powers. {9.2.20}</p>
<p>“They hold in their hands a sword,</p>
<p>An axe, a vajra scepter, and a bow.</p>
<p>He should also summon the five ḍākinīs</p>
<p>Of the five great elements who accomplish every type of activity, {9.2.21}</p>
<p>“And the great queen of the maṇḍala of the union,</p>
<p>Along with the mighty vajra lord.</p>
<p>In the great assembly of the tathāgatas</p>
<p>She is the stainless emanation from the union. {9.2.22}</p>
<p>“By the command of the vajra queen, he should invoke all of them from all their respective places. {9.2.23}</p>
<p>“He should recite:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, p-pp-pull, b-bb-bind, d-dd-devour! Kill, kill all the evil ones! S-ss-strike! Appease all negativity for such and such! Hūṁ hūṁ! Phaṭ phaṭ! Jaḥ, svāhā! {9.2.24}</p>
<p>“Relying on the contemplation of ambrosia and filling thereby the mouths of the deities with it, he should meditate on yogins and yoginīs as the executors of any activity he can think of. He will then succeed in every type of activity. {9.2.25}</p>
<p>“The syllable ha removes the ambrosia’s ordinary color,</p>
<p>The syllable ho neutralizes its ordinary odor,</p>
<p>And the syllable hrī removes its ordinary potency—</p>
<p>This is the prescribed order of reciting these three syllables. {9.2.26}</p>
<p>“Repeating these three syllables thrice,</p>
<p>He should meditate on them as the three deities. {9.2.27}</p>
<p>“Padmeśvara (Amitābha) possesses the beauty and loveliness of gold;</p>
<p>The beautifully lucent one (Vairocana) possesses an incorruptible perfume;</p>
<p>And Vajrapāṇi (Akṣobhya) is the vajra lord of good flavor.</p>
<p>These three deities are known as the above three syllables. {9.2.28}</p>
<p>“ ‘See all phenomena here as pure!</p>
<p>Discard nihilist meditation!</p>
<p>Since brahmins, dogs, and outcastes are</p>
<p>Of the same nature, eat [everything]!’ {9.2.29}</p>
<p>“Reciting the lines of this verse, he should offer [the ambrosia oblation],</p>
<p>And then display the gesture of “turning the lotus” {9.2.30}</p>
<p>“With his left and right hands,</p>
<p>Playfully and with supreme grace.</p>
<p>He should proceed according to instruction</p>
<p>Through the practice of his personal deity. {9.2.31}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Sugata’s teaching is priceless;</p>
<p>It is free from the stains of passion</p>
<p>And from grasping and non-grasping.</p>
<p>Let us pay homage to it with devotion.’ {9.2.32}</p>
<p>“With this verse, he should receive [the ambrosia]. This is the principle of the yogin’s proper practice, pure in every respect. {9.2.33}</p>
<p>“He should then recite the following as he wishes:</p>
<p>“ ‘Let us pay homage to the one who is free from becoming</p>
<p>And supplicate him that beings may reach pleasant destinies.</p>
<p>May they be adorned with the magical display</p>
<p>Of the coupling embrace, hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ!’ {9.2.34}</p>
<p>“He should sing this song of benediction</p>
<p>To the accompaniment of the bell. {9.2.35}</p>
<p>“Folding his hands in the vajra gesture of añjali,</p>
<p>He should position them at his heart.</p>
<p>Then, he should make a dedication</p>
<p>For the sake of all sentient beings, and so forth, reciting: {9.2.36}</p>
<p>“ ‘May all beings be happy!</p>
<p>May all beings be well!</p>
<p>May they traverse the path</p>
<p>By which they will attain awakening! {9.2.37}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will deliver those who have not been delivered.</p>
<p>I will release those who have not been released.</p>
<p>I will be compassionate toward them in their present condition,</p>
<p>Acting consistently with the teachings of yoga.’ {9.2.38}</p>
<p>“He should form the ‘vajra fist’ with both hands.</p>
<p>Placing the left fist at his heart,</p>
<p>He should extend the right one forward and,</p>
<p>Placing it on the ground, dismiss the deities by saying: {9.2.39}</p>
<p>“Oṁ, Please remain in my body! Hūṁ svāhā! {9.2.40}</p>
<p>“Subsequently, the deities are absorbed</p>
<p>Into his body with his breath.</p>
<p>In an instantaneous union, he should make offerings,</p>
<p>Visualizing himself as the deity. {9.2.41}</p>
<p>“He should recite:</p>
<p>“Oṁ, seize, seize the evil ones and depart! Hūṁ phaṭ! {9.2.42}</p>
<p>“He should snap his fingers three times and dismiss the outer deities.” {9.2.43}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the ninth chapter, about the offering of oblation.</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>While the Blessed One, ever-present in every body,</p>
<p>Was abiding within the secret lotus, the pleasure realm of Sukhāvatī,</p>
<p>The goddess who, for her own part, abides in secrecy,</p>
<p>Requested the following: {9.3.1}</p>
<p>“Please tell me everything, O lord!</p>
<p>Tell me about the hidden domain of sublime reality,</p>
<p>About the maṇḍala of all the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>And also about the wrathful ones and the deities. {9.3.2}</p>
<p>“I do know the ultimate reality</p>
<p>Which is present within myself,</p>
<p>But I am not certain regarding the methods</p>
<p>Of making the painting and writing the manuscript. {9.3.3}</p>
<p>“I do not know that, so please tell me, O Great Bliss!” {9.3.4}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“The painter should be a young person with a pure heart,</p>
<p>Steadfast, gentle, and free of discursive thinking.</p>
<p>He should be free of deceit and anger, well trained,</p>
<p>Dexterous, and full of faith and compassion. {9.3.5}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, to do the painting, one should commission a painter who has been given the samaya. Such a sublime practitioner should paint Tārā, Mārīcī, or Parṇaśāvarī on cloth from a fallen war hero, cloth that wrapped a corpse, cloth used during childbirth, cloth stained with human blood, or cloth soaked with menstrual blood. {9.3.6}</p>
<p>“This is the procedure to follow. Staying at a secret location, one should have a well-focused person do the painting; he should paint the frightening form with a brush of a corpse’s hair, using the five colors as explained, mixed with olibanum, camphor, and other ambrosias, placed in a human skull. {9.3.7}</p>
<p>“First, the teacher, well focused, united in embrace with the consort (prajñā), adorned with all manner of jewelry, and abiding in union with the glorious Sampuṭa, should take off his clothes, while visualizing himself as wearing bone ornaments. {9.3.8}</p>
<p>“The wise should not have the painting done with leftover or impure materials.” {9.3.9}</p>
<p>[The goddess asked:]</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, if the paints are infused with olibanum (menstrual blood), how then would they not be impure?” {9.3.10}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“The first purity is the messenger lady,</p>
<p>Moon is regarded as the second,</p>
<p>And all the dainty foodstuffs together</p>
<p>Are said to be the third purity. {9.3.11}</p>
<p>“These purities should be undertaken</p>
<p>By those who enjoy external yoga.</p>
<p>Should one’s mind become impure,</p>
<p>Of what use would be ritual ablutions? {9.3.12}</p>
<p>“Anyone who lives by a perverse Dharma,</p>
<p>Desiring all kinds of sense pleasures,</p>
<p>Will be born one hundred times as a dog,</p>
<p>And later be reborn among the outcastes. {9.3.13}</p>
<p>“Just as someone who wants ghee</p>
<p>But naively churns water,</p>
<p>Does not obtain ghee</p>
<p>But only physical exhaustion, {9.3.14}</p>
<p>“So too will the concentration and veneration</p>
<p>Of those with other such aims be futile—</p>
<p>If it is for the sake of vitality,</p>
<p>They should rather resort to other types of yoga. {9.3.15}</p>
<p>“Who would disparage the skull</p>
<p>That embodies the dharmakāya—</p>
<p>The skull arisen from the material cause</p>
<p>Common to the triad of conch, oyster shell, and pearl? {9.3.16}</p>
<p>“The means of purification of those invested with the sacred cord</p>
<p>Is said to be their conduct conforming to the true Dharma.</p>
<p>Since the purity is found in the glorious Heruka,</p>
<p>One should worship with all perseverance</p>
<p>Together with one’s consort (mudrā). {9.3.17}</p>
<p>“The practitioner should thus place his personal consort (mudrā) to his left. She should have a beautiful face and fine figure, be compassionately disposed, be graced with beauty and youth, and be fond of the practitioner. One should consecrate the brush and give it to the painter. {9.3.18}</p>
<p>“The painter should make a painting that inspires</p>
<p>Dread and bounteously grants all accomplishments.</p>
<p>It should be viewed by the painter and the practitioner,</p>
<p>Without being shown to anyone else. {9.3.19}</p>
<p>“Listen, O goddess of great fortune!</p>
<p>I will now teach you about the writing of the manuscript.</p>
<p>One who has been given the samaya</p>
<p>Should write it either on birchbark or palm leaf. {9.3.20}</p>
<p>“One should make the folios</p>
<p>Twelve fingers long</p>
<p>And use ‘great honey’ as ink.</p>
<p>It should be written with a stylus of human bone. {9.3.21}</p>
<p>“Should an inappropriate person see</p>
<p>Either the manuscript or the painting,</p>
<p>No accomplishment will be had in this life,</p>
<p>Nor in the domains of the afterlife. {9.3.22}</p>
<p>“One should never allow others</p>
<p>To see the samayasattva.</p>
<p>When in public view, one should hide</p>
<p>The book in one’s hair or under the armpit. {9.3.23}</p>
<p>“One can, however, lend it to those who share the same samaya,</p>
<p>So that they can copy it prior to performing the ritual.” {9.3.24}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the ninth chapter, called “The Codification of the Painting and the Manuscript.”</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>“Listen, O goddess, I will now teach the music</p>
<p>Characteristic (lakṣaṇa) of sampuṭa. {9.4.1}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Vajradhara (as sampuṭa) and the others is:</p>
<p>“Ara ara, jeṁ jeṁ! Recollect recollect! Caṭa! Vaṁ, hoḥ hoḥ! Hulu hulu! Rulu rulu! Hūṁ, jaḥ jaḥ! Ala ala! Hūṇu Hūṇu! Hraṁ hraṁ hraṁ! Hū taṁ, ghai ghai, yai yai! Ta ṭa, gho gho, ṣeṁ ṣeṁ, taṁ taṁ, ghe ghe, hondo hondo, do! Hūṁ hūṁ! Kaka kaka, kau kau kau, vaiṃ vaiṃ, kaiṃ kaiṃ, krauṁ krauṁ krauṁ, vaiṁ! Vajra vajra, vajrīṁ vajrīṃ, vaiḥ, kaiṁ kaiṃ kaiṁ, hūṁ! Bhyo bhyo bhyo! {9.4.2}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Līlāgati is as follows:</p>
<p>“Ṭaki, hūṁ, jaḥ jaḥ jaḥ! {9.4.3}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Hayagrīva is:</p>
<p>“Taḍava taḍava! To the steed, the steed! {9.4.4}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Yamarāja is:</p>
<p>“Hrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ, hrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ, ṣṭrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ, hrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ, hrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ, hrīṁ ṣṭrīṁ! {9.4.5}</p>
<p>“The mantra of Tārā is:</p>
<p>“Hrīṁ hrīṁ, kuṁ hrīṁ, kuṁ hrīṁ, khe khe, kheṁ kheṁ kheṁ, padmaṃ padmaṃ, hrīṁ, padmaṃ padmaṃ padmaṃ, trīṁ trāṁ, trīṁ trāṁ, trīṁ trāṁ, hrīṁ hrīṁ hrīṁ, hrī taṁ, hrī taṁ, hrīṁ hrīṁ hrīṁ!{9.4.6}</p>
<p>“I will now describe the characteristics of the small hand drum used for these mantras.</p>
<p>“One should make this drum from the root of a sandal tree</p>
<p>Belonging to the red variety found in the Himālayas,</p>
<p>And also any other articles</p>
<p>That are pleasing to the mind.” {9.4.7}</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One specified the following measurements:</p>
<p>“It should be twelve or ten finger-widths in length,</p>
<p>With a drumhead that is six or five finger-widths in diameter.</p>
<p>It can also be nine or eleven finger-widths in length,</p>
<p>With the drumhead being half of that. {9.4.8}</p>
<p>“Optionally, to make a different kind of drum,</p>
<p>“One should stretch monkey skin on a human skull,</p>
<p>So that it forms its drumhead.</p>
<p>Inside each of the two hollows of the skull one should draw a lotus.</p>
<p>To make it beautiful, one should draw it with menstrual blood. {9.4.9}</p>
<p>“One should tie together the two pieces of skull bone</p>
<p>With a string twined from human hair recovered from a cemetery.</p>
<p>Then, using only ‘secret flower,’ one should draw a maṇḍala</p>
<p>On the pericarp of each of the two lotuses in the hollows of the skull. {9.4.10}</p>
<p>“One should go at nighttime to a crossroads and draw,</p>
<p>With the big toe of one’s left foot,</p>
<p>A vajra hook in each of the corners</p>
<p>Of a four-sided maṇḍala. {9.4.11}</p>
<p>“Stepping there with one’s left heel, one should recite kheṁ hūṁ,</p>
<p>Preceded by the summoning formula with the target’s name.</p>
<p>While reciting kheṁ hūṁ,</p>
<p>One should stomp one’s left foot in the manner of a lapwing. {9.4.12}</p>
<p>“In this way, all the six Kambojīs</p>
<p>Will be summoned without a doubt.</p>
<p>If they do not come,</p>
<p>All these ḍākinīs will die. {9.4.13}</p>
<p>“So they will certainly respond to the ritual;</p>
<p>There is no doubt about what I have said. {9.4.14}</p>
<p>“If the master plays the ḍamaru when agitated, the ḍākinīs will cry a torrent of tears. {9.4.15}</p>
<p>“[The following is a password song to get admitted to a gaṇacakra feast:]</p>
<p>“ ‘Your samaya conduct shines brightly, O Blue Angry One!</p>
<p>In your hand you hold a staff set with precious stones.</p>
<p>Behold me, O hero, amidst the yoginīs, entering the door to the assembly,</p>
<p>The assembly that is the liberated saṃsāra.’ {9.4.16}</p>
<p>“Listen, O goddess, O greatly fortunate one,</p>
<p>About the excellent things offered at the gaṇacakra.</p>
<p>If one partakes of them, the accomplishment will follow—</p>
<p>One that will bring the fulfillment of all wishes. {9.4.17}</p>
<p>“In a charnel ground, a mountain thicket,</p>
<p>On the shore of a great ocean,</p>
<p>In a deserted place or wilderness,</p>
<p>One should prepare the following articles of enjoyment: {9.4.18}</p>
<p>“Flowers, incense, and lamps,</p>
<p>And also hard and soft foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The liquor is said to be a playful woman;</p>
<p>The wine is said to be a wanton woman. {9.4.19}</p>
<p>“The rum is said to be the god of love;</p>
<p>This best of alcohols is ambrosia.</p>
<p>Through the outcaste of all buddhas,</p>
<p>Ambrosia is the eightfold path. {9.4.20}</p>
<p>“The sweet grape wine is the Sole Hero;</p>
<p>The oyster shell is the One with Harsh Desire.</p>
<p>The rice brew (masculine) is said to be a sensualist,</p>
<p>And the rice brew (feminine) is said to be a female slave. {9.4.21}</p>
<p>“By having the good fortune to partake,</p>
<p>In this way, of such delicacies</p>
<p>As various foods, alcoholic beverages, and fish,</p>
<p>One will attain the level of glorious Vajrasattva. {9.4.22}</p>
<p>“Ripe mangoes, breadfruit,</p>
<p>Grapes, coconuts, plums, and so forth—</p>
<p>One should offer, at the gaṇacakra gathering,</p>
<p>An assortment of different fruits. {9.4.23}</p>
<p>“A special dance should be performed, along with gestures and singing:</p>
<p>“Ka ka ka ka ka, hi hi hi hi, hīṁ hīṁ hīṁ hīṁ, hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ, hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ, hūṁ hūṁ hūṁ, hā hā hā hā, hā hā hā hā, hā hā hā hā, i hā hā, i hā hā, ḍā ḍā ḍā, jāṁ jāṁ jāṁ jāṁ, a i u, jaṁ jāṁ, iṁ jāṁ, iṁ jāṁ, iṁ iṁ, jeṁ jeṁ jeṁ, iṁ teṁ traṁ, hi hi hi hi, hīḥ hīḥ hīḥ, hi hi hi, hī hī hī, hī hī hī, hī hī hī, kajjaṃ, hi hī. {9.4.24}</p>
<p>“Singing thus, an outcaste woman shakes to this song.</p>
<p>The dance, and in particular the ritual gestures,</p>
<p>Should be performed while in meditative union with Heruka. {9.4.25}</p>
<p>“Since the gazes correspond with the fist gestures,</p>
<p>And both are synchronized with the footsteps of the dance,</p>
<p>They express the stages of yoga</p>
<p>As performed by all the buddhas. {9.4.26}</p>
<p>“The consort could be one’s mother,</p>
<p>Sister, younger sister, or niece.</p>
<p>One should worship them ardently,</p>
<p>And one will gain accomplishment at the gaṇacakra feast. {9.4.27}</p>
<p>“The pupil should present to his master, O fortunate lady,</p>
<p>A human skull cup made from a single piece of bone,</p>
<p>Filled with divinely delicious wine.</p>
<p>Having made obeisance to him, he should drink of it himself. {9.4.28}</p>
<p>“He should hold it and offer it</p>
<p>With the same hand forming a lotus gesture.</p>
<p>The officiants should bow at this point</p>
<p>To the master again and again.” {9.4.29}</p>
<p>This concludes the ninth chapter of the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa” called “The King of the Essence of the Four Rituals.”</p>
<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>“Listen, Vajrapāṇi, about the samaya that results</p>
<p>In the accomplishments of a vajra master.</p>
<p>Having prepared the Great Circle, which comes first,</p>
<p>One should summon the heart maṇḍala. {10.1.1}</p>
<p>“Through one’s entering the first, the Great Circle,</p>
<p>And performing there the elaborate ritual of initiation and so forth,</p>
<p>One will attain the unequaled status</p>
<p>Of a vajra master, there can be no doubt. {10.1.2}</p>
<p>“For by being devoted to meditation upon what was learned,</p>
<p>One will attain the status of a vajra master.</p>
<p>One will fully succeed after reciting</p>
<p>The heart mantra of Vajrasattva, and so forth, 100,000 times. {10.1.3}</p>
<p>“Once one becomes a fully accomplished great master,</p>
<p>One’s accomplishment will endure through all the ages.</p>
<p>By this means sentient beings become the victorious buddhas —</p>
<p>Can there be any doubt about this? {10.1.4}</p>
<p>“Those who make an effort to abide in nonduality</p>
<p>Don their armor and adhere to reality. {10.1.5}</p>
<p>“Whatever female consort (mudrā) has been prescribed to whatever male</p>
<p>By the omniscient ones based on the [buddha] family association of the two,</p>
<p>Such a consort (mudrā) should be procured through the prescribed means</p>
<p>Only by such a partner, who will practice only with her. {10.1.6}</p>
<p>“If he whose nature is delusion obtains the mother,</p>
<p>Or a learned brahmin woman,</p>
<p>Such a meditator, after purifying his delusion,</p>
<p>Will in actuality become Vairocana. {10.1.7}</p>
<p>“The mother is the ultimate consort (vidyā),</p>
<p>Especially if she was just before enjoyed by the father.</p>
<p>She will definitely grant an accomplishment,</p>
<p>As has been declared by the lord Great Bliss. {10.1.8}</p>
<p>“If he whose nature is hatred obtains</p>
<p>An outcaste woman’s daughter, or a yakṣa girl,</p>
<p>Such a meditator will, after purifying his hatred,</p>
<p>Attain, in actuality, the state of Akṣobhya. {10.1.9}</p>
<p>“If he whose nature is passion obtains a dancer’s daughter,</p>
<p>His own younger sister, or a nāga or asura girl,</p>
<p>Such a meditator, after purifying his lust,</p>
<p>Will become, in his nature, Amitābha. {10.1.10}</p>
<p>“If he whose nature is envy obtains</p>
<p>A lovely apsaras, expert in crafts, or one’s own niece,</p>
<p>Such a meditator will become,</p>
<p>After purifying his envy, the hero Amoghasiddhi. {10.1.11}</p>
<p>“If he whose nature is arrogance obtains a king’s daughter,</p>
<p>Or perhaps a daughter or a wife of a vidyādhara,</p>
<p>Such a meditator will become, after purifying his arrogance,</p>
<p>Ratnasambhava, and will join the jewel family. {10.1.12}</p>
<p>“Consorting with Locanā, he becomes Tathāgata Buddha;</p>
<p>With Māmakī, he attains the state of Tathāgata Akṣobhya;</p>
<p>With Pāṇḍaravāsinī, Amitābha of the lotus family;</p>
<p>And with Tārā, he will attain the state of Amoghasiddhi. {10.1.13}</p>
<p>“Alternatively, he can become Ratnasambhava by consorting with Ratnolkā.</p>
<p>In this way has the union of the two partners been taught.</p>
<p>Through this union he can attain also the state of other deities,</p>
<p>Such as wrathful deities or divine daughters of the victorious ones. {10.1.14}</p>
<p>“Wrathful deities can be accomplished by fierce rites;</p>
<p>Peaceful deities, only by peaceful rites.</p>
<p>Impassioned deities are accomplished by passionate rites;</p>
<p>Haughty deities, by the rites of enriching. {10.1.15}</p>
<p>“Such methods, which are free of hardship,</p>
<p>Have been praised by the omniscient and compassionate masters.</p>
<p>These methods are for attaining extraordinary bliss,</p>
<p>Without severe precepts or austere practices. {10.1.16}</p>
<p>“If someone, having obtained the taste of ambrosia in this way,</p>
<p>Does not make effort for the sake of removing his afflictions,</p>
<p>How would he be able to produce awakening</p>
<p>By following precepts that are difficult to keep? {10.1.17}</p>
<p>“The fool who does not do anything for his own sake,</p>
<p>After having found his personal easy practice,</p>
<p>Where will he go next after departing from this life?</p>
<p>He cannot know where he will be reborn again. {10.1.18}</p>
<p>“Genuine people, once they become realized through this practice,</p>
<p>Will always see all activities and their effects as a dream or illusion.</p>
<p>He who does not understand the Buddhadharma should do this practice</p>
<p>Until he reaches the other shore of the ocean of saṃsāra.” {10.1.19}</p>
<p>This concludes the first part of the tenth chapter, on the consecration to the position of a master by means of a consort (mudrā).</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>“The following powers become unleashed</p>
<p>When a man becomes accomplished through a consort (vidyā):</p>
<p>The earth will shake in six different ways</p>
<p>As the earth goddess will be filled with ecstatic happiness. {10.2.1}</p>
<p>“Overjoyed, she will make a sound like the bell-metal cymbals</p>
<p>Produced in the country of Magadha.</p>
<p>Meteor showers will fall throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>Resembling the fire at the end of an eon. {10.2.2}</p>
<p>“The oceans will roar with turbulence,</p>
<p>And hurricanes will strike everywhere.</p>
<p>Right there, the lights of gnosis will flare up,</p>
<p>Resembling the fire during the final destruction. {10.2.3}</p>
<p>“All the worlds of the triple universe</p>
<p>Will become the womb of the consort (vidyā).</p>
<p>Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Varuṇa, Śakra, Rudra,</p>
<p>Agni, the Āśvins, Bhānu and Candra, {10.2.4}</p>
<p>“The yakṣas, celestial siddhas, gandharvas,</p>
<p>Kinnaras, nāgas, vidyādharas,</p>
<p>Apsarases, and so forth, and those in other places,</p>
<p>The gods residing in the Realm of the Thirty-Three, {10.2.5}</p>
<p>“Having come there, overjoyed,</p>
<p>Will throw heaps of flowers in offering.</p>
<p>Floating in the sky they will worship</p>
<p>With the sounds of lutes, flutes, drums, {10.2.6}</p>
<p>“Madhurīs, conches, large drums,</p>
<p>Piccolo flutes, kettle drums, and tambourines.</p>
<p>The apsaras girls will dance and so too will</p>
<p>All the young daughters of vidyādhara kings. {10.2.7}</p>
<p>“The kinnaras will sing songs</p>
<p>And play various instruments.</p>
<p>The yakṣas will shout, “Victory! Victory!”</p>
<p>Playing around and making merry. {10.2.8}</p>
<p>“Rejoicing at this event, the celestial siddhas will extend their congratulations. The gods from the Tuṣita Realm, the most eminent gods from places near and far, the divine and semi-divine sons, the celestial vidyādharas—all will bow in reverence, filling space as far as the realm of Akaniṣṭha. {10.2.9}</p>
<p>“With great devotion they will offer heaps of different kinds of flowers, rains of different fragrances, and different kinds of prime quality incense. Of what need would a detailed description of other offered items be to you? Whatever articles are worth offering in the three realms for merit to be gained, they will offer them.” {10.2.10}</p>
<p>This concludes the second part of the tenth chapter, called “The Worship and Homage on the Occasion of the Accomplishment of Great Bliss.”</p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>[The goddess asked:]</p>
<p>“Where does the man accomplished by means of a consort (vidyā) go, and where does he remain? I am not certain about this. Please tell me, O Great Bliss.” {10.3.1}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“A man accomplished by means of a consort (vidyā) does not go anywhere, nor does he remain anywhere. He is the light of the triple universe, which is nondual and has no beginning, middle, or end. He is everywhere, he is omniscient, he is universal, and he is all things. He abides in the consciousness of all beings and is free of all negativity. Adorned with all good qualities, he is endowed with everything. He brings happiness, and is a peerless, perpetually arising lord and protector, free of conceptual thinking. Devoid of shape and color, he is the king beyond the purview of even the victorious ones. {10.3.2}</p>
<p>“Being unbreakable, he is the vajra.</p>
<p>Free from the burning torment of afflictions, he is the cool-rayed moon.</p>
<p>Free of doubt, he is like a lion.</p>
<p>Difficult to fathom, he is like an ocean. {10.3.3}</p>
<p>“In this way he is described by yogins using the comparisons just given. He alone fulfills the interests of every sentient being. {10.3.4}</p>
<p>“Even though he is devoid of conceptual thought, he displays the great deeds, including (1) birth which is his final one, (2) leaving home, (3) the playful exploits of his childhood, (3) leaving his household, (4) the solitary peregrinations of a religious mendicant, (6) reaching the spot of the vajra seat, (7) defeating Māra, (8) attaining an unequaled state of perfect awakening, (9) giving instructions that constitute the turning of the wheel of Dharma, (10) enjoying the descent from the realm of gods, (11) performing a great variety of miraculous feats, (12) subjugation of the elephant Dhanapāla, (13) inducting virtuous people into purity, (14) refuting opposing doctrines, (15) blameless subsistence by the alms bowl, (16) taming the inhabitants of the triple universe, (17) becoming the crown prince of bodhisattvas, (18) fulfilling the great aim of parinirvāṇa, and (19) becoming the Dharma king of the three realms. {10.3.5}</p>
<p>“So it is, O sons of the noble lineage! He who is accomplished will in this way display, employing illusory forms, the marvelous play of a buddha for the benefit of all beings—the play extraordinary in many ways and said to be like a dream.” {10.3.6}</p>
<p>This concludes the third part of the tenth chapter called “The Buddha’s Magical Transformations.”</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>[The goddess said:]</p>
<p>“You have previously mentioned, O lord, a homa offering consisting of feces, urine, menstrual blood, fish, and meat. {10.4.1}</p>
<p>“How is it with regard to the wisdom beings,</p>
<p>That their mouths should be filled with impurities?</p>
<p>How is it that no nonvirtue is committed?</p>
<p>Were one in fact nonvirtuous, what would the result be?” {10.4.2}</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“Beings who are deluded by not knowing,</p>
<p>And deprived of gnosis and skillful means,</p>
<p>Are strongly attached to external objects</p>
<p>And are thus confounded by the mass of concepts. {10.4.3}</p>
<p>“To them, sin and merit</p>
<p>Seem to be two separate categories.</p>
<p>In truth, though, these phenomena are</p>
<p>By nature pure—unarisen and without basis. {10.4.4}</p>
<p>“The buddhas taught the skillful means of merit</p>
<p>In order to develop gnosis in beings.</p>
<p>But if, in terms of the absolute truth, merit is to be abandoned,</p>
<p>Why hold on to the concept of demerit? {10.4.5}</p>
<p>“Just as someone crossing to the other shore</p>
<p>Of a river filled with water</p>
<p>Will build a raft that floats on the surface</p>
<p>By assembling logs of wood and bundles of straw, {10.4.6}</p>
<p>“But after having crossed the river clutching to it,</p>
<p>He will discard it and walk on without difficulty,</p>
<p>So too someone crossing to the other shore of saṃsāra</p>
<p>Will ride upon the distinction between right and wrong. {10.4.7}</p>
<p>“Once awakening has been safely attained,</p>
<p>It is free from the distinction between right and wrong.</p>
<p>Consequently, he will develop in the profound Dharma</p>
<p>Once he has discarded the network of concepts. {10.4.8}</p>
<p>“When traveling the path taught by the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>The mantra adept should not entertain concepts,</p>
<p>For concepts are great ignorance—</p>
<p>They mire one in the ocean of saṃsāra. {10.4.9}</p>
<p>“He who abides in nonconceptual samādhi</p>
<p>Will shine, stainless as the sky.</p>
<p>When the vital powers of the coupling pair combine,</p>
<p>Their bodies, speech, and minds likewise coalesce. {10.4.10}</p>
<p>“By this means they attain identity with the deity,</p>
<p>Thus becoming reflections of the Victorious One, devoid of all forms.</p>
<p>You should cause this gnosis to unfold,</p>
<p>Becoming its adepts in this very life. {10.4.11}</p>
<p>“It has been taught that the bodies of women and men</p>
<p>Are a complex result of their actions.</p>
<p>One should not, out of ignorance, act waywardly—</p>
<p>This is the samaya of vajra body. {10.4.12}</p>
<p>“One should not corrupt their minds</p>
<p>By burdening sentient beings with various austerities</p>
<p>That give rise to stressful conceptual thinking—</p>
<p>This is the samaya of vajra mind. {10.4.13}</p>
<p>“One should not say words that are</p>
<p>Slanderous, untrue, or harsh,</p>
<p>But only those that are pleasant to the listener—</p>
<p>This is the samaya of vajra speech. {10.4.14}</p>
<p>“The buddha who abides in the flesh element</p>
<p>Is Vairocana, the seniormost of the five.</p>
<p>Akṣobhya dwells in the marrow of the bones;</p>
<p>Blood is the domain of Ratnasambhava, adorned with magnificent jewels. {10.4.15}</p>
<p>“Amitābha is the bones,</p>
<p>Understood to be the compactness within all beings.</p>
<p>Amoghasiddhi, the most eminent of sages,</p>
<p>Sustains the network of sinews and tendons. {10.4.16}</p>
<p>“A secret will now be taught to you,</p>
<p>The samaya for adepts in gnosis: {10.4.17}</p>
<p>“Using the vajra mind, the wise one</p>
<p>Should always pay attention to and cultivate</p>
<p>Desire, hatred, delusion, craving,</p>
<p>And volitions, causing their increase. {10.4.18}</p>
<p>“These five have been taught by the buddhas, the most eminent of sages, as the fivefold effluence of feces, urine, semen, phlegm, and menstrual blood. He should observe the samayas through mental cultivation in full, based on embracing the four elements. He should always ingest these samaya substances. {10.4.19}</p>
<p>“Just as a lover delighting in young women’s talk</p>
<p>Would extend an invitation to meet one of them for a chat</p>
<p>And describe the path to take rather than obstruct it,</p>
<p>So too is the excellent path pointed out to a yogin, in the like manner.” {10.4.20}</p>
<p>Then, everyone in the audience—the yogins and yoginīs, the eighty crores of ḍākas and ḍākinīs, many bodhisattvas and the numerous congregations of tathāgatas—pleased and with minds filled with joy, obtained the gnosis of all the tathāgatas completely. All the great bodhisattva beings, headed by Vajragarbha, and all the gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas—the entire assembly—rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One. {10.4.21}</p>
<p>This concludes the tenth great sovereign chapter of the glorious “Emergence from Sampuṭa,” the emergence that is the foundation of all tantras.</p>
<p>Tibetan Colophon</p>
<p>This king of tantras was translated by the paṇḍita Gayādhara and the great personage Drokmi Śākya Yeshé. Based on this, the venerable omniscient Butön subsequently [re-]wrote it by filling in the gaps and expertly revising it in consultation with Indian manuscripts of the basic text and commentaries.</p>
