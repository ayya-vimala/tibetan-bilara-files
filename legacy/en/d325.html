<h1>The Verses of Nāga King Drum</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>The Thus-Gone One has spoken</p>
<p>Of his past lives as a bodhisattva.</p>
<p>As these stories have been carefully collected,</p>
<p>Listen now with a faithful mind.</p>
<p>Once, when the perfect Buddha, the god of gods,</p>
<p>The Thus-Gone One, was still alive,</p>
<p>Some monks sought to get the better of each other,</p>
<p>Through rhetoric and other means.</p>
<p>The Great Sage overheard</p>
<p>The negative words uttered by the monks.</p>
<p>So the Sage summoned the saṅgha</p>
<p>And told everyone,</p>
<p>“You inflict harm on one another</p>
<p>By rhetoric and other means.</p>
<p>Such actions are not suitable</p>
<p>For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.</p>
<p>“Engage in six practices</p>
<p>That are sure to always bring joy.</p>
<p>These are suitable</p>
<p>For those who have gone forth from home to homelessness.</p>
<p>“Monks, hear from me</p>
<p>How I cultivated nonviolence</p>
<p>And strove for awakening,</p>
<p>Out of compassion for all beings.</p>
<p>“Wise persons who have heard this</p>
<p>Will avoid negative actions,</p>
<p>And for the sake of success and happiness,</p>
<p>Will engage in virtuous deeds.</p>
<p>“Once, there were two nāga kings</p>
<p>Who were brothers.</p>
<p>The first was called Drum,</p>
<p>And the second, Tambour.</p>
<p>“They both abstained from killing, upheld morality,</p>
<p>And were known to possess great powers.</p>
<p>Displeased with their birth as nāgas,</p>
<p>They yearned for a human existence.</p>
<p>“Whenever they came across ascetics and priests</p>
<p>Who were disciplined and learned,</p>
<p>They transformed themselves into humans,</p>
<p>To offer their service and respect.</p>
<p>“Twice a month, whether on the eighth, fourteenth,</p>
<p>Or fifteenth day,</p>
<p>They practiced the rite of restoring vows</p>
<p>Involving the eight precepts.</p>
<p>“The two left their former home</p>
<p>And journeyed to a new land,</p>
<p>Where there lived, not far away,</p>
<p>A nāga named Drumbeat.</p>
<p>“Sensing the arrival</p>
<p>Of the two fine nāga brothers,</p>
<p>His mind was filled with arrogance and anger,</p>
<p>And he belched out a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>“ ‘You two are not engaged in Dharma,</p>
<p>But are deceitful, undisciplined hypocrites,’ he said.</p>
<p>Drumbeat harassed them repeatedly</p>
<p>With hurtful words such as these.</p>
<p>“Hearing abuse from someone as lowly as he,</p>
<p>Tambour grew enraged.</p>
<p>To his elder brother Drum,</p>
<p>He explained the things he had heard.</p>
<p>“ ‘O Drum, in this world of humans,</p>
<p>Hurtful words that cause much harm are spoken.</p>
<p>This toad-eater, born on the bank of a stream,</p>
<p>Is driving us away with venomous fangs.</p>
<p>“ ‘He harms both the animals who live in water</p>
<p>And the humans who live on land.</p>
<p>O Lord, though I may possess patience,</p>
<p>My mind cannot tolerate such abusive words.</p>
<p>“ ‘Let us now lay waste to his city,</p>
<p>His palace, and his relatives and attendants.</p>
<p>Having overthrown Drumbeat,</p>
<p>Let us then take leave of this place.’</p>
<p>“Hearing the words of his younger brother,</p>
<p>The mighty nāga king</p>
<p>Instructed him</p>
<p>By uttering these pleasing verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not foster malice toward one</p>
<p>In whose home you have stayed for few days,</p>
<p>Or from whom you have received food and drink—</p>
<p>The virtue of gratitude is extolled by sublime beings.</p>
<p>“ ‘You would not cut off the leaves</p>
<p>Of a tree that has provided you shade,</p>
<p>No matter how briefly;</p>
<p>Need we say anything of its trunk or branches?</p>
<p>“ ‘Trees of the forest, whether felled or burned,</p>
<p>Will grow again—of this there is no doubt.</p>
<p>But just as hands, when chopped off, do not grow back,</p>
<p>One who is hostile to his friends will find no lasting happiness.</p>
<p>“ ‘A bad person will abandon his friends,</p>
<p>No matter how long he is shown respect,</p>
<p>Or served delicious food and drink—</p>
<p>He is like an elephant in a grass hut.</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as the trees on riverbanks will fall,</p>
<p>Persons who are deceptive and unreliable</p>
<p>Do not enjoy lasting friendship—</p>
<p>They are like white cloth simmered in plant dye.</p>
<p>“ ‘Should the wise desire</p>
<p>To cause displeasure to their enemies,</p>
<p>They must free their minds from negativities,</p>
<p>For this hurts them just as much.</p>
<p>“ ‘The oceans, mountains, and lands</p>
<p>Do not weigh us down.</p>
<p>But not repaying kindness</p>
<p>Does, in fact, weigh us down.</p>
<p>“ ‘People who are calm</p>
<p>Will repay kindness, acknowledge it,</p>
<p>And not squander it;</p>
<p>They are thus commended by the wise.</p>
<p>“ ‘The Dharma is joyful, and love is joyful,</p>
<p>Like a river with pleasant banks.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who rid themselves of pride and arrogance</p>
<p>And do not begrudge friends are indeed joyful.</p>
<p>“ ‘Conceit, deception, and arrogance;</p>
<p>Reliance on immoral friends; and</p>
<p>Conflict with the powerful—</p>
<p>These will ruin your reputation.</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore, do not be conceited,</p>
<p>And completely relinquish anger.</p>
<p>When conceit and anger arise,</p>
<p>They completely ruin your reputation.</p>
<p>“ ‘Whoever lacks compassion for elders, infants, and the sick;</p>
<p>For the weak, helpless, and lowly; and</p>
<p>For those who are banished and helpless—</p>
<p>Such a person shall not be deemed human.</p>
<p>“ ‘If you leave your country and home,</p>
<p>And travel to a foreign land,</p>
<p>You must cultivate strong patience</p>
<p>To counter all harsh words.</p>
<p>“ ‘If suffering abuse in your own land,</p>
<p>It is better to live in the lands of others;</p>
<p>Because wherever you are not abused</p>
<p>Is your land, and they are your people.</p>
<p>“ ‘Excellent beings, when subjected to abuse,</p>
<p>Give up beautiful wives and vast wealth.</p>
<p>Immoral ones, however, are entangled in these,</p>
<p>And end up drenched with abuse.</p>
<p>“ ‘Because prosperity is rare</p>
<p>While poverty is abundant,</p>
<p>When people face ruin,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When left with no wealth and few options,</p>
<p>When your kin are weak,</p>
<p>Or when your rivals are strong,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people indulge in immoral deeds,</p>
<p>Strongly crave sense pleasures,</p>
<p>And have little faith and no sense of shame,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people show anger and</p>
<p>A profusion of malice,</p>
<p>And are spiteful toward others,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people lack faith,</p>
<p>Prattle on like crows,</p>
<p>And resort to guile and deception,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people are morally debased,</p>
<p>Act fiercely and callously,</p>
<p>And lack righteousness,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people are ill-natured,</p>
<p>Overcome by false views,</p>
<p>And fierce and hateful,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people are shameless and tell lies,</p>
<p>Or resort to pointless, divisive, hurtful,</p>
<p>Gossipy, or divisive speech,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When people are bereft of noble ways,</p>
<p>Extremely arrogant, and inflated with pride,</p>
<p>And are jealous, greedy, and lacking in manners,</p>
<p>Just keep quiet and you will find joy.</p>
<p>“ ‘When living amidst people</p>
<p>Whose caste and paternal lineage</p>
<p>Are unknown,</p>
<p>It is not right to be prideful.</p>
<p>“ ‘When dwelling in a foreign land,</p>
<p>Sustained by others’ provisions,</p>
<p>For the sake of the land and peoples’ well-being,</p>
<p>Have patience when scorned by others.</p>
<p>“ ‘When living in a foreign land,</p>
<p>Sustained by others’ provisions,</p>
<p>If caught in a spiteful conflict,</p>
<p>Have patience when scorned by others.</p>
<p>“ ‘When dwelling in a foreign land,</p>
<p>Sustained by others’ provisions,</p>
<p>Even if a lowly person tries to drive you away,</p>
<p>The wise should show patience.</p>
<p>“ ‘Alas! If I’m living in a backward land,</p>
<p>Where I meet vile companions,</p>
<p>Wicked people who fraternize with childish fools</p>
<p>Offer no reliable support.</p>
<p>“ ‘The wise, having considered this,</p>
<p>May befriend ignorant people;</p>
<p>Yet, they will refrain from resenting their hypocritical</p>
<p>Concern with wealth and amenities.</p>
<p>“ ‘Embers covered by ashes</p>
<p>Can burst back into flames,</p>
<p>When fueled with straw and twigs</p>
<p>And fanned by the wind.</p>
<p>“ ‘Burning through the straw and twigs,</p>
<p>Fire spreads and blazes,</p>
<p>Burning ever more straw and twigs</p>
<p>And full-grown trees as well.</p>
<p>“ ‘Likewise, anger is like a wildfire,</p>
<p>Blazing from the fuelwood of thinking, and</p>
<p>Wreaking massive devastation</p>
<p>Upon oneself and others.</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore, whenever anger arises,</p>
<p>The learned, in order to counter this,</p>
<p>Cultivate the attitude of love,</p>
<p>Which is the antidote to aggression.</p>
<p>“ ‘To be friendly when praised,</p>
<p>And unfriendly when not,</p>
<p>Should be immediately discarded,</p>
<p>For these are traits of childish fools.</p>
<p>“ ‘If these childish fools,</p>
<p>Who are like birds with their feathers plucked,</p>
<p>Were not so bereft of intelligence and in need of insight,</p>
<p>Then how would the learned eke out a living?</p>
<p>“ ‘But most childish people</p>
<p>Are bereft of intelligence and in need of insight;</p>
<p>Therefore, it is quite easy</p>
<p>For the learned and insightful to eke out a livelihood.</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned do not take joy in amassing wealth,</p>
<p>Nor they are bewildered or disturbed by poverty.</p>
<p>Since they preach what is beneficial to adopt,</p>
<p>Why do others not recognize it as wise counsel?</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned are without impetuosity—</p>
<p>They pay heed to what they have examined,</p>
<p>And having contemplated such subjects well,</p>
<p>They implement whatever is good for themselves and others.</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned do not indulge in negative deeds</p>
<p>For the sake of survival.</p>
<p>Whether in pleasure or in pain,</p>
<p>They never forsake their virtuous goals.</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned are not deceitful,</p>
<p>Being neither deluded, nor scornful, nor angry.</p>
<p>Misfortune does not cause them suffering—</p>
<p>So how could they be affected when others harm them?</p>
<p>“ ‘They are not the type of inferior person</p>
<p>Who is overly impetuous or diffident.</p>
<p>Keeping an even keel</p>
<p>Is a characteristic of such learned ones.</p>
<p>“ ‘Excessive impetuosity leads to perpetual resentment,</p>
<p>While excessive diffidence leads to perpetual loathing.</p>
<p>Therefore, by avoiding these two,</p>
<p>One should maintain a balanced position.</p>
<p>“ ‘Act deaf and mute at times,</p>
<p>But command like a ruler when the time is right.</p>
<p>Remain cool like a snow mountain at times,</p>
<p>But burn like fire when the time is right.</p>
<p>“ ‘Be humble like the grass at times,</p>
<p>But stand firm like a mountain when the time is right.</p>
<p>Act like a king at times,</p>
<p>But leave for the forest like a sage when the time is right.</p>
<p>“ ‘Accept hunger and thirst at times,</p>
<p>And embrace pain and pleasure at other times.</p>
<p>Avoid being exploited like a servant for the sake of wealth,</p>
<p>And do not let yourself be controlled by anger.</p>
<p>“ ‘Take pleasure in song and music at times;</p>
<p>And relish meat and alcohol.</p>
<p>Move cautiously like a deer at times,</p>
<p>Yet display the prowess of a predator when the time is right.</p>
<p>“ ‘Initially, assess whether or not the time is right,</p>
<p>Whether or not you have the necessary strength,</p>
<p>And whether there will be success or failure—</p>
<p>Only then should you act upon the matter.</p>
<p>“ ‘Be patient with those who are impatient,</p>
<p>And also with those who are patient.</p>
<p>Be patient with those who are weak,</p>
<p>And always with those who are strong.</p>
<p>“ ‘Since hostility never pacifies hostility,</p>
<p>It is better to be patient with those who lack patience themselves.</p>
<p>Always be tranquil with those who are irritable,</p>
<p>And always ignore others’ faults.</p>
<p>“ ‘Words of superiors are meant to intimidate, and</p>
<p>Words of rivals are meant to provoke a fight, so have patience.</p>
<p>The noble ones have declared that showing patience for the words of one’s inferiors</p>
<p>Is known as the supreme patience.</p>
<p>“ ‘Small-minded people who are impatient</p>
<p>With those who curse, speak rashly,</p>
<p>And use harsh words</p>
<p>Are like hail falling on a lotus flower.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those learned ones who demonstrate great patience</p>
<p>To those who curse, speak rashly,</p>
<p>And use harsh words</p>
<p>Are like a rain of flowers falling on an elephant.</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned, possessing wisdom,</p>
<p>Have patience for all those</p>
<p>Who are angry and deceitful,</p>
<p>And who use harsh words.</p>
<p>“ ‘A rock does not melt when burned,</p>
<p>Nor does it dissolve in the rain;</p>
<p>Likewise, the learned never succumb</p>
<p>To either happiness or pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘When justly scolded,</p>
<p>The learned remain patient;</p>
<p>But they also remain patient when unjustly accused.</p>
<p>No one demonstrates this apart from them.</p>
<p>“ ‘In this way, the learned may strive to endure</p>
<p>Tolerable suffering for the sake of wealth;</p>
<p>But if they can abandon intolerable miseries</p>
<p>And go elsewhere, it is like gaining a thousandfold.</p>
<p>“ ‘Don’t try to reach and grasp for branches.</p>
<p>Instead, be free from desire, and don’t let your mind become attached.</p>
<p>Since the Earth is filled with good and pleasant things,</p>
<p>Surely you can go elsewhere in this wide world?</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever you are scorned, disrespected,</p>
<p>Ridiculed, or defamed,</p>
<p>It is better to leave quietly like a solitary buddha.</p>
<p>There is no good reason for the learned to keep company with fools.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever people take delight in conflict,</p>
<p>Entertain deceitful thoughts, are persistently malicious,</p>
<p>And indulge in gossipy, divisive, deceitful, or abusive speech,</p>
<p>The learned will swiftly leave for other places.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever people indulge in violence</p>
<p>To make their living,</p>
<p>And are frivolous in thought, word, and deed,</p>
<p>The learned will swiftly leave for other places.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever people are overcome by jealousy,</p>
<p>And can never accept the success of others,</p>
<p>Or maliciously resort to treachery and duplicity,</p>
<p>Those who care for their own good must leave for other places.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever people are bent on committing evil,</p>
<p>Seek veneration while resorting to treachery and duplicity,</p>
<p>Or are impure both within and without,</p>
<p>Those who care for their own good must leave for other places.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever people lack respect, and</p>
<p>Are lacking good manners, proud, and arrogant, and</p>
<p>Wherever the childish constantly belittle the learned,</p>
<p>Those who care for their own good must leave for other places.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wherever you can find food and drink,</p>
<p>Clothing and sustenance,</p>
<p>Go there—</p>
<p>Dwell not in havens that breed desire.</p>
<p>“ ‘Abandon craving, which occasionally even causes fights,</p>
<p>Abandon arrogance, which is always inflated and vain,</p>
<p>Abandon anger, which bears only harmful consequences,</p>
<p>And abandon friends, who do not visit when you are in need.</p>
<p>“ ‘Abandon ignorance, which is like a fiery path;</p>
<p>Abandon desire, which is like an ungrateful friend;</p>
<p>Abandon attachment, which is like a nāga with terrifying fangs; and</p>
<p>Abandon suffering, which is like well-armed enemy.</p>
<p>“ ‘Abandon your wife, that horrific nāginī;</p>
<p>Give up your children, who are like fire burning on your head;</p>
<p>Give up your household, which is like a contagious disease; and</p>
<p>Give up desire, which is like a poisonous drink.</p>
<p>“ ‘For the sake of the family, one must give up a member;</p>
<p>For the sake of the town, one must give up a family;</p>
<p>For the sake of the country, one must give up a town; and</p>
<p>For one’s own sake, one must give up the world.</p>
<p>“ ‘For the sake of their limbs, people will give up money;</p>
<p>And for the sake of their lives, they will give up their limbs.</p>
<p>Yet, to practice the Dharma, one must give away everything—</p>
<p>Wealth, limbs, and even one’s life.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those practicing the Dharma will have no fear.</p>
<p>Those practicing the Dharma will not go to the lower realms.</p>
<p>Those practicing the Dharma will go wherever they wish.</p>
<p>Those not practicing the Dharma will die and suffer.</p>
<p>“ ‘The learned take no joy in gaining wealth,</p>
<p>Nor do they lose their minds when it runs out.</p>
<p>The ability to move easily wherever one wants in the world</p>
<p>Is what makes humans so special among all its beings.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who happily give to others,</p>
<p>Abandon arrogance and harm, remain truthful,</p>
<p>And possess oceanic minds</p>
<p>Are indeed courageous, valorous, courteous, and skillful.</p>
<p>“ ‘Whoever trains in all these things</p>
<p>Will become learned in all subjects.</p>
<p>Such gentle and amiable people</p>
<p>Will be praised by sublime beings.’</p>
<p>“Tambour then replied,</p>
<p>‘O Drum, as time has passed,</p>
<p>My faith in you has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Whether my body becomes emaciated,</p>
<p>“ ‘Or I lose my senses, I care not!</p>
<p>Even if I fall into unbearable suffering,</p>
<p>I shall not commit negativities in the future.</p>
<p>Rather than living with impaired discipline,</p>
<p>“ ‘It is better to die with my discipline intact.</p>
<p>Therefore, within a single lifetime,</p>
<p>I will train correctly and untiringly.’ ”</p>
<p>The Blessed One continued,</p>
<p>“In the past, wherever I dwelled,</p>
<p>And wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I wound up committing negative deeds</p>
<p>Due to keeping all sorts of negative company.</p>
<p>“Once I met a spiritual friend,</p>
<p>I abandoned negative deeds</p>
<p>And so I eradicated negative karma.”</p>
<p>The Blessed Thus-Gone One</p>
<p>Knows the realities of all former lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Sage now turned to the monks</p>
<p>And spoke these words:</p>
<p>“In the past, I was Drum,</p>
<p>Ānanda was Tambour, and</p>
<p>Devadatta was Drumbeat.</p>
<p>Remember our past lives in this fashion.”</p>
<p>Having heard this meaningful discourse</p>
<p>That condenses the entire Dharma,</p>
<p>All the monks respectfully engaged</p>
<p>In the practice of the Dharma.</p>
<p>This completes The Verses of Nāga King Drum.</p>
