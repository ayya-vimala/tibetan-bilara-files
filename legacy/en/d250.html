<p>The Four Factors</p>
<p>Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was residing in Śrāvastī at Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, together with a great saṅgha of 1250 monks.</p>
<p>At that time, the Blessed One addressed the monks in a voice that was steady, deep, harmonious, and far-reaching, saying, “Monks, there are four beliefs that a wise son of good family does not hold for as long as he lives. What are these four?</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that there is pleasure to be found in women.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that there is pleasure to be found at the court of the royal palace.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that he is attractive, handsome, good looking, and in good health.</p>
<p>“Monks, for as long as he lives, a wise son of good family does not hold the belief that he is rich, wealthy, and has abundant resources.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One spoke these words. Once the Sugata had spoken in this way, he, the Teacher, also said the following:</p>
<p>“How could it be right to depend on women?</p>
<p>How could the royal palace ever be delightful?</p>
<p>How could a bubble possess a solid core?</p>
<p>How could one’s wealth possibly endure?</p>
<p>“Wealth is like a rushing river.</p>
<p>A home is like a ferryboat.</p>
<p>One’s body resembles a flower.</p>
<p>Life itself is like a water bubble.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had said this, the monks, together with the world of devas, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Sūtra on the Four Factors.”</p>
