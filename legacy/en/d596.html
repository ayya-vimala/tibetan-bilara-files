<h1>Crown Victory of All Tathāgatas</h1>
</header>
<p>The Uṣṇīṣavijayā Dhāraṇī with Its Ritual Manual</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time.  The blessed, thus-gone, worthy, perfectly awakened Buddha Amitāyus was staying in the excellent secret palace, Dharma Proclamation, in Sukhāvatī. He looked out at the circle of his retinue and said to Noble Avalokiteśvara, “Alas, bodhisattva great beings and sons and daughters of noble family, there are beings who suffer, are afflicted with diseases, and have short lifespans. To help them, one should uphold and recite this dhāraṇī called the crown victory of all tathāgatas and teach it extensively to others for the sake of long life.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva, the great being, Avalokiteśvara arose from his seat, joined his palms, and said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please teach! Well-Gone One, please teach the dhāraṇī called the crown victory of all tathāgatas.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One looked upon the circle of his perfect retinue, entered the samādhi called the splendor beheld everywhere, and pronounced this dhāraṇī called the crown victory of all tathāgatas:</p>
<p>“oṁ namo bhagavate sarvatrailokyaprativiśiṣṭāya buddhāya te namaḥ |  tadyathā | oṁ bhrūṁ bhrūṁ bhrūṁ | śodhaya śodhaya | viśodhaya viśodhaya | asamasamantāvabhāsaspharaṇagatigaganasvabhāvaviśuddhe | uṣṇīṣavijayapariśuddhe | abhiṣiñcantu māṃ sarvatathāgatāḥ sugatavaravacanāmṛtābhiṣekair mahāmudrāmantrapadaiḥ | āhara āhara mama āyuḥsandhāraṇi | śodhaya śodhaya | viśodhaya viśodhaya | gaganasvabhāvaviśuddhe | uṣṇīṣavijāyapariśuddhe | sahasraraśmisañcodite | sarvatathāgatāvalokini | ṣaṭpāramitāparipūraṇi | sarvatathāgatamāte | daśabhūmipratiṣṭḥite | sarvatathāgatahṛdayādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭḥite | mudre mudre mahāmudre | vajrakāyasaṃhatanapariśuddhe | sarvakarmāvaraṇaviśuddhe | pratinivartaya mamāyurviśuddhe | sarvatathāgatasamayādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhite |  oṁ muni muni mahāmuni | vimuni vimuni mahāvimuni | mati mati mahāmati | mamati | sumati | tathatābhūtakoṭipariśuddhe | visphuṭabuddhiśuddhe | he he | jaya jaya | vijaya vijaya | smara smara | sphara sphara | sphāraya sphāraya | sarvabuddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhite | śuddhe śuddhe | buddhe buddhe | vajre vajre mahāvajre | suvajre | vajragarbhe | jayagarbhe | vijayagarbhe | vijayagarbhe | vajrajvālagarbhe | vajrodbhave | vajrasambhave | vajre | vajrini | vajram bhavatu mama śarīraṃ sarvasatvānāñ ca kāyapariśuddhir bhavatu | sadā me sarvagatipariśuddhiś ca | sarvatathāgatāś ca māṃ samāśvāsayantu | budhya budhya | siddhya siddhya | bodhaya bodhaya | vibodhaya vibodhaya | mocaya mocaya | vimocaya vimocaya | śodhaya śodhaya | viśodhaya viśodhaya | samantān mocaya mocaya | samantaraśmipariśuddhe | sarvatathāgatahṛdayādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhite | mudre mudre mahāmudre | mahāmudrāmantrapadaiḥ svāhā.</p>
<p>“Write down this dhāraṇī called the crown victory, which purifies all evil deeds and obscurations and eliminates all lower rebirths, and place it at the summit of the life-pillar of a caitya. If one bathes and recites this dhāraṇī eight thousand times on the full moon day, one’s life force that has been exhausted will instead be replenished. One will be swiftly freed from lower rebirths, one’s obscurations will be purified, and one will thus attain unsurpassed awakening.</p>
<p>“If animals hear this dhāraṇī, this will be their final lower rebirth. Until they attain awakening, they will be born into kṣatriya, brahmin, merchant, and householder families as prominent as the great sāl tree.</p>
<p>“If someone is touched by the shadow of that caitya, or even if they are touched by a particle of dust from it, they will not take lower rebirths.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One spoke these words, the bodhisattva great being Noble Avalokiteśvara  rejoiced and praised what he had said.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Uṣṇīṣavijayā Dhāraṇī with Its Ritual Manual.”</p>
