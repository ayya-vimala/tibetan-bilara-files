<p>The Introduction</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Homage to the buddhas and the bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Thus have I heard at one time. The Bhagavān was dwelling on Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha together with a great saṅgha of twelve hundred bhikṣus, all of whom were solely arhats whose defilements had ceased; who were without kleśas; who had mastered themselves; who had liberated minds; who had completely liberated wisdom; who were noble beings; who were great elephants; who had done what had to be done; who had accomplished what had to be accomplished; who had put down their burden; who had reached their goals; who had ended engagement with existence; and who had liberated their minds through true knowledge, had perfectly attained all the powers of the mind, were renowned for their higher knowledge, and were mahāśrāvakas.</p>
<p>They were Brother Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, Brother Aśvajit, Brother Vāṣpa, Brother Mahānāman, Brother Bhadrika, Brother Mahākāśyapa, Brother Uru­vilvā­kāśyapa, Brother Nadīkāśyapa, Brother Gayākāśyapa, Brother Śāriputra, Brother Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Brother Mahākātyāyana, Brother Aniruddha, Brother Revata, Brother Kapphiṇa, Brother Gavāṃpati, Brother Pilindavatsa, Brother Bakkula, Brother Mahākauṣṭhila, Brother Bharadvāja, Brother Nanda, Brother Upananda, Brother Sundarananda, Brother Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra, Brother Subhūti, Brother Rāhula, and other great śrāvakas; and the student Brother Ānanda; and also two thousand bhikṣus who were in training and had transcended training; and six thousand bhikṣuṇīs such as Mahāprajāpatī and bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, and her followers.</p>
<p>Also present were eighty thousand bodhisattvas, all of whom were irreversible from great enlightenment; had attained retention; remained in great eloquence; turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma; had attended many hundred thousands of buddhas; had planted the roots of merit with many hundred thousands of buddhas; had praised many hundred thousands of buddhas whose bodies, speech, and minds were pervaded with love; and who were adept in entering the wisdom of the tathāgatas, had great wisdom, had fully realized the perfection of wisdom, were renowned in many hundreds of thousands of worlds, and had liberated many hundred thousands of hundred thousands of millions of beings. They were the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, the bodhisattva Sarvārthanāman, the bodhisattva Nityodyukta, the bodhisattva Anikṣiptadhura, the bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi, the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajya­samudgata, the bodhisattva Vyūharāja, the bodhisattva Pradānaśūra, the bodhisattva Ratnacandra, the bodhisattva Ratnaprabha, the bodhisattva Pūrṇacandra, the bodhisattva Mahāvikrāmin, the bodhisattva Anantavikrāmiṇ, the bodhisattva Trailokya­vikrāmiṇ, the bodhisattva Mahāpratibhāna, the bodhisattva Satata­samitābhiyukta, the bodhisattva Dharaṇīdhara, the bodhisattva Akṣayamati, the bodhisattva Padmaśrī, the bodhisattva Nakṣatrarāja, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Siṃha. Also present were the sixteen excellent men, such as Bhadrapāla. They were Bhadrapāla, Ratnākara, Susārthavāha, Naradatta, Guhyagupta, Varuṇadatta, Indradatta, Uttaramati, Viśeṣamati, Vardhamānamati, Amoghadarśin, Susaṃprasthita, Su­vikrānta­vikrāmiṇ, Anupamamati, Sūryagarbha, and Dharaṇīṃdhara.</p>
<p>These and the other eighty thousand bodhisattvas were present there.</p>
<p>Also present was Śakra, the lord of the devas, with his retinue of twenty thousand devas, such as the deva Candra, the deva Sūrya, the deva Samantagandha, the deva Ratnaprabha, the deva Avabhāsaprabha, and the rest of the twenty thousand devas.</p>
<p>Also present were the four mahārājas and their retinue of thirty thousand devas: Mahārāja Virūḍhaka, Mahārāja Virūpākṣa, Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Mahārāja Vaiśravaṇa, the deva Īśvara, the deva Maheśvara, and a retinue of thirty thousand devas.</p>
<p>Also present were Brahmā, the lord of the Sahā world realm, with a retinue of twelve hundred Brahmakāyika devas: the brahmā Śikhin, the brahmā Jyotiṣprabha, and the rest of the one thousand two hundred Brahmakāyika devas.</p>
<p>Also present were the eight nāga kings—the nāga kings Nanda, Upananda, Sāgara, Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Manasvin, Anavatapta, and Utpalaka—together with a retinue of many trillions of nāgas.</p>
<p>Also present were the four kinnara kings—the kinnara king Druma, the kinnara king Mahādharma, the kinnara king Sudharma, and the kinnara king Dharmadhara—together with a retinue of many trillions of kinnaras.</p>
<p>Also present were devas who were of the four classes of gandharvas—Manojña, Manojñasvara, Madhura, and the gandharva Madhurasvara—together with a retinue of many trillions of gandharvas.</p>
<p>Also present were the four lords of the asuras—the asura lords Bali, Kharaskandha, Vemacitrin, and Rāhu—together with a retinue of many trillions of asuras.</p>
<p>Also present were the four garuḍa lords—the garuḍa lords Mahātejas, Mahākāya, Mahāpūrṇa, and Maha­rddhi­prāpta—together with many trillions of garuḍas.</p>
<p>Also present was King Ajātaśatru of Magadha, the son of Vaidehī.</p>
<p>At that time, the Bhagavān, surrounded by the fourfold assembly, was esteemed, honored, revered, respected, offered to, praised, and venerated. He had taught the Dharma teaching of the great extensive sūtra called The Great Elucidation, which is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas.</p>
<p>Sitting cross-legged on that Dharma seat, he entered the samādhi named the state of infinite instruction; his body became motionless and his mind became motionless.</p>
<p>As soon as the Bhagavān entered that state there fell a rain of coral tree flowers, great coral tree flowers, and spider lily and great spider lily flowers, that fell upon the Bhagavān and his fourfold assembly. The whole buddha realm shook in six ways: it moved, moved strongly, quaked, quaked strongly, shuddered, and shuddered strongly. Then at that time the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, the upāsakas and upāsikās, the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, kings of regions, bala­cakra­vartins, and cakravartins of the four continents, together with their retinues who were gathered in that assembly, were all gazing upon the Bhagavān with wonder, amazement, and joy.</p>
<p>Then at that time, a light ray shone from the ūrṇā hair between the Bhagavān’s eyebrows into eighteen thousand buddha realms in the eastern direction. The light of that light ray pervaded all those buddha realms from the great Avīci hell up to the apex of existence. It illuminated all beings without exception in the six classes of existence in those buddha realms. It also illuminated the buddha bhagavāns who resided, lived, and remained in those buddha realms. The Dharma that those buddha bhagavāns taught was heard by all without exception.</p>
<p>It illuminated in those buddha realms all the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, yogins, and yogācāras, both those who had attained the result and those who had not attained the result.</p>
<p>It illuminated in those buddha realms the bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas who practiced bodhisattva conduct through being skilled in methods, due to the many various ways of listening to the teachings, having objectives, and having aspirations.</p>
<p>It illuminated in those buddha realms the stūpas made of precious materials that contained the relics of the buddha bhagavāns who had passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Then bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya thought, “Oh! The Tathāgata has shown this great miraculous sign. Why did the Bhagavān show this kind of great miraculous sign? The Bhagavān, while resting in this samādhi, has revealed these kinds of inconceivable, marvelous, amazing, great miracles. Who can answer my question as to what this means? This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has served previous jinas, has planted the roots of merit, and has attended many buddhas. This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has also previously seen this kind of sign from past tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, and he has previously heard numerous accounts of the great Dharma. I should ask Mañjuśrī.”</p>
<p>The bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, the upāsakas and upāsikās, and the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans saw this light that was the great miraculous sign of the Bhagavān and were amazed, astonished, and intrigued.</p>
<p>They thought, “Whom shall we ask about this great miraculous sign revealed by the Bhagavān?”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya instantaneously knew the thoughts in the minds of the fourfold assembly, and inquired of Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, what was the cause and what the reason for the Bhagavān manifesting this wonderful illumination through a marvelous, astonishing, miraculous light that revealed these eighteen thousand beautiful, supremely beautiful buddha realms, among which are the tathāgatas and also the followers of the tathāgatas?”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then spoke these verses to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta:</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, for what reason</p>
<p>Did this guide of men emit this single ray of light,</p>
<p>This greatly illuminating light</p>
<p>From the ūrṇā hair between his eyebrows? {1}</p>
<p>“The rejoicing devas sent down</p>
<p>A great rain of sandalwood powder,</p>
<p>Divine, delightful perfumes,</p>
<p>And coral tree and spider lily flowers. {2}</p>
<p>“They beautified this entire earth</p>
<p>And this fourfold retinue was filled with joy.</p>
<p>This entire realm shook terrifyingly</p>
<p>In six different ways. {3}</p>
<p>“The light ray in the eastern direction</p>
<p>Filled eighteen thousand realms.</p>
<p>Those beautiful realms, the color of gold,</p>
<p>Were all illuminated in an instant. {4}</p>
<p>“All the beings that are in those realms</p>
<p>From Avīci up to the highest existence,</p>
<p>Those who are in the six classes of beings,</p>
<p>Who pass away and are reborn in them, {5}</p>
<p>“And also their various kinds of karma,</p>
<p>Their happy and unhappy existences are visible.</p>
<p>The good, the bad, and similarly the neutral,</p>
<p>Have all been seen by those who are present here. {6}</p>
<p>“I see the buddhas, the lion-like lords of humans,</p>
<p>Teaching and revealing the Dharma,</p>
<p>Giving teachings to many millions of beings,</p>
<p>Speaking in verses with melodious voices. {7}</p>
<p>“Each in their own realm gives forth</p>
<p>Their profound, vast, and marvelous speech.</p>
<p>They are teaching this Buddhadharma</p>
<p>Through trillions of parables and reasons. {8}</p>
<p>“They teach the ultimate peace of nirvāṇa</p>
<p>To those beings that are afflicted by suffering,</p>
<p>Who are weary of birth and aging, and have no knowledge,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Bhikṣus, this is the end of suffering.’ {9}</p>
<p>“They teach the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna,</p>
<p>Describing this way of the Dharma</p>
<p>To those humans who have attained vast power,</p>
<p>Who have reached it through merit and seeing the buddhas. {10}</p>
<p>“Also, they praise enlightenment</p>
<p>To those who are the offspring of the sugatas,</p>
<p>Who are seeking for the highest wisdom,</p>
<p>And accomplish various activities throughout all times. {11}</p>
<p>“Mañjughoṣa, while I am present here</p>
<p>I see and hear such things that are there.</p>
<p>I shall describe merely an indication</p>
<p>Of billions of other different perceptions. {12}</p>
<p>“I see within those many realms</p>
<p>Bodhisattvas as numerous as the Ganges sands.</p>
<p>They number not less than a thousand million</p>
<p>And give rise to enlightenment through various kinds of diligence. {13}</p>
<p>“Some in that way give away gifts</p>
<p>Of wealth, money, gold, and silver;</p>
<p>Pearl jewelry, mother of pearl, and coral;</p>
<p>Male slaves, female slaves, chariots, horses, and sheep. {14}</p>
<p>“Similarly, with a joyful mind they give</p>
<p>The gifts of palanquins adorned with jewels,</p>
<p>Dedicating this toward supreme enlightenment,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘May we attain that yāna!’ {15}</p>
<p>“Through this kind of giving of gifts</p>
<p>May I also quickly become one who has attained</p>
<p>That unique supreme yāna within the three realms,</p>
<p>Which is the Buddhayāna praised by the sugatas. {16}</p>
<p>“Some of them similarly make gifts</p>
<p>Of chariots that are drawn by four horses,</p>
<p>With seats adorned by flowers and banners,</p>
<p>With flags of victory made of precious materials. {17}</p>
<p>“Some give their sons and similarly their wives,</p>
<p>And some give their own beloved flesh,</p>
<p>And, seeking this highest enlightenment,</p>
<p>They give their hands and feet when requested. {18}</p>
<p>“Some give their heads and some their eyes,</p>
<p>And some give their perfect bodies.</p>
<p>They give these gifts with a serene mind,</p>
<p>Intent upon the wisdom of the tathāgatas. {19}</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, I have seen some</p>
<p>Who forsake their prosperous kingdoms,</p>
<p>Giving up their harems, and likewise</p>
<p>All continents and all ministers and relatives. {20}</p>
<p>“They come before the guides of the worlds</p>
<p>And for the highest peace they ask about the Dharma.</p>
<p>They put on the saffron robes</p>
<p>And shave off their hair and moustaches. {21}</p>
<p>“I see some bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who are bhikṣus living in the forests,</p>
<p>Dwelling in empty, solitary places,</p>
<p>Delighting in reciting the teachings. {22}</p>
<p>“I see some bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who are dwelling resolutely in the mountains,</p>
<p>Meditating on this wisdom of the buddhas,</p>
<p>Contemplating it and observing it. {23}</p>
<p>“Some give up all sensory pleasures</p>
<p>And meditate while having pure conduct.</p>
<p>Having developed the five higher knowledges</p>
<p>These children of the sugatas live in solitude. {24}</p>
<p>“Some resolute ones, standing with legs together,</p>
<p>Join their palms in homage before the guides.</p>
<p>Feeling joy, with thousands of verses,</p>
<p>They praise the king who is the Lord of Jinas. {25}</p>
<p>“Some who are fearless, mindful, and tamed</p>
<p>Are endowed with the wisdom of subtle conduct.</p>
<p>They ask the lords of humans about the Dharma,</p>
<p>And having listened to it, they become holders of the Dharma. {26}</p>
<p>“I see some children of lords of jinas</p>
<p>In meditation here and there,</p>
<p>Teaching the Dharma to many millions of beings,</p>
<p>With many millions of parables and reasons. {27}</p>
<p>“They are joyfully teaching the Dharma</p>
<p>And are inspiring many bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>They vanquish the māras with their armies and chariots,</p>
<p>And they are loudly beating the drum of the Dharma. {28}</p>
<p>“I see some who follow the teaching of the sugatas,</p>
<p>To whom humans, maruts, yakṣas and rākṣasas make offerings.</p>
<p>These children of the sugatas are not astonished,</p>
<p>Have no pride, are peaceful, and have peaceful conduct. {29}</p>
<p>“They are primarily living in forests, but also</p>
<p>Their bodies are shining with light</p>
<p>That brings beings out from the hells</p>
<p>And also inspires them toward enlightenment. {30}</p>
<p>“Some children of the jinas are maintaining diligence,</p>
<p>Forsaking completely all sleep.</p>
<p>Wandering around, living in forests,</p>
<p>Through diligence they are established in the highest enlightenment. {31}</p>
<p>“Some are maintaining unimpaired, correct conduct</p>
<p>That is always as pure as a precious jewel.</p>
<p>Some have completely perfect conduct</p>
<p>And through conduct are established in the highest enlightenment. {32}</p>
<p>“Some children of the jinas have the power of patience;</p>
<p>They have patience toward proud, aggressive bhikṣus,</p>
<p>And similarly patience toward abuse and threats.</p>
<p>Through patience they are established in the highest enlightenment. {33}</p>
<p>“I see some bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who forsake all delight in amusements.</p>
<p>They forsake foolish companions</p>
<p>And are steadfast in delighting in the company of noble ones. {34}</p>
<p>“Having forsaken the mind’s distractions</p>
<p>They practice meditation with a one-pointed mind</p>
<p>For billions of years in forests and in mountains,</p>
<p>And through meditation are established in the highest enlightenment. {35}</p>
<p>“And similarly there are those who give gifts</p>
<p>Of food and drink—both hard food and soft food—</p>
<p>And medicine for illness, not a little but a great amount,</p>
<p>Directly to the jinas and their saṅghas of students. {36}</p>
<p>“They give thousands of millions of robes</p>
<p>Of the value of millions of millions.</p>
<p>They give robes with priceless value</p>
<p>Directly to the jinas and their saṅghas of students. {37}</p>
<p>“They create billions of monasteries</p>
<p>Made from jewels and likewise sandalwood,</p>
<p>Adorned by a plenitude of seats and beds</p>
<p>That they donate directly to the sugatas. {38}</p>
<p>“Some give, as places for resting during the day,</p>
<p>Beautiful, pure parklands</p>
<p>With a variety of flowers and fruits</p>
<p>To the Supreme Being and his disciples. {39}</p>
<p>“With a feeling of joy they are giving</p>
<p>Various different gifts such as these.</p>
<p>Having given them they strive for enlightenment with diligence</p>
<p>And through generosity are established in the highest enlightenment. {40}</p>
<p>“Some are teaching the Dharma of peace</p>
<p>Through many trillions of parables and reasons;</p>
<p>They are teaching billions of beings</p>
<p>And through knowledge are established in the highest enlightenment. {41}</p>
<p>“Knowing the Dharma that is without activity,</p>
<p>They have entered nonduality, which is the same as space.</p>
<p>The children of the sugatas who are without attachment,</p>
<p>Through wisdom are established in the highest enlightenment. {42}</p>
<p>“I see others, Mañjughoṣa, following the teachings</p>
<p>Of sugatas who have passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Many resolute bodhisattvas appear</p>
<p>Who honor the relics of the jinas. {43}</p>
<p>“I see thousands of millions of stūpas,</p>
<p>As numerous as the sands of the Ganges.</p>
<p>They continually adorn millions of realms</p>
<p>And are created because of the children of the jinas. {44}</p>
<p>“Thousands of millions of parasol standards</p>
<p>Made of the seven precious materials are erected.</p>
<p>In height they are five thousand yojanas</p>
<p>And their circumference is two thousand yojanas. {45}</p>
<p>“Always with beautiful banners of victory</p>
<p>And the constant sound of bells and little bells,</p>
<p>Humans, maruts, rākṣasas, and yakṣas make offerings</p>
<p>With flowers, perfumes, and similarly with music. {46}</p>
<p>“The children of the sugatas are those who cause</p>
<p>These kinds of offerings to be made to the relics of the jinas,</p>
<p>Just as the blossoming coral trees</p>
<p>Beautify the ten directions. {47}</p>
<p>“I and many millions of beings</p>
<p>Present here have seen all that;</p>
<p>The Jina, with this single light ray from his visage,</p>
<p>Has made this world and its devas blossom. {48}</p>
<p>“Oh! The vast immaculate wisdom—</p>
<p>Oh! Of the powerful Supreme Being—</p>
<p>The one who today emitted a single light ray</p>
<p>And revealed many thousands of realms! {49}</p>
<p>“We are amazed to have seen such a sign</p>
<p>As this, which is marvelous and immeasurable.</p>
<p>Tell us, Mañjusvara, the meaning of this sign</p>
<p>And eliminate the doubts of the bodhisattvas. {50}</p>
<p>“This delighted fourfold retinue</p>
<p>Is looking at you, hero, and at me.</p>
<p>Why did this Sugata today</p>
<p>Emit this kind of light? {51}</p>
<p>“You, son of the sugata, give an explanation</p>
<p>That will bring joy and dispel doubt.</p>
<p>For what reason has there been</p>
<p>This emission of a vast light ray? {52}</p>
<p>“Lord of the World, will you teach</p>
<p>The supreme qualities attained by the Sugata,</p>
<p>The supreme being, at the Bodhimaṇḍa?</p>
<p>Bodhisattva, will you explain them? {54}</p>
<p>“The many thousands of revealed realms</p>
<p>Are adorned by various brilliant jewels,</p>
<p>And buddhas with infinite vision are revealed.</p>
<p>This certainly has no little cause.” {55}</p>
<p>Maitreya thus questioned the son of the Jina</p>
<p>To the delight of the humans, maruts, yakṣas, and rākṣasas.</p>
<p>The fourfold assembly waited there</p>
<p>For the explanation that Mañjusvara would give. {56}</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the complete assembly of bodhisattvas, “Noble sons, the Tathāgata’s intention is to relate a great Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Noble sons, the Tathāgata’s intention is to send down a great Dharma rain, to sound the great Dharma drum, to erect the great Dharma banner, to light the great Dharma lamp, to blow the great Dharma conch, and to beat the great Dharma bherī drum. Noble sons, that is the intention the Tathāgata has formed today.</p>
<p>“Noble sons, from previous tathāgatas there has come illumination with a light ray like this, and I think that just as it was revealed to me, just as I have seen an omen of this kind in the past from previous tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, this tathāgata, too, intends to give a great Dharma teaching, to make others hear a great Dharma teaching, and has therefore created such an omen. Why is that? The Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha has revealed a miraculous omen of this kind, this illumination from a ray of light, because he intends to teach the Dharma that is not in accord with the entire world.</p>
<p>“Noble sons, I remember that in a past time, even further back beyond incalculable, numberless, immeasurable, inconceivable, vast, completely countless asaṃkhyeya eons ago, at that time, in that era, there appeared in the world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Candra­sūrya­pradīpa.</p>
<p>“He taught the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end; has excellent meaning and excellent words; and is unalloyed, complete, pure, perfected, and concerns pure conduct.</p>
<p>“To the śrāvakas he taught the Dharma conjoined with the four truths of the āryas, and nirvāṇa as the ultimate goal, as well as the process of dependent origination, in order that they might transcend birth, aging, sickness, death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and distress.</p>
<p>“To the bodhisattva mahāsattvas he taught the Dharma that commences with the highest, complete enlightenment conjoined with the six perfections, and concludes with omniscient wisdom.</p>
<p>“Noble sons, subsequent to that tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa, there appeared in the world a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha who was also named Candra­sūrya­pradīpa.</p>
<p>“Ajita, in this way there appeared sequentially tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who had the same name, Candra­sūrya­pradīpa, and the same family and same clan, which means there were twenty thousand tathāgatas of the Bharadvājasa family.</p>
<p>“Ajita, from the first of those twenty thousand tathāgatas until the last of those tathāgatas they taught the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end; has excellent meaning and excellent words; and is unalloyed, complete, pure, perfected, and concerns pure conduct.</p>
<p>“To the śrāvakas they taught the Dharma that has the four truths of the āryas and dependent origination, so that the śrāvakas might transcend the troubles of birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing, suffering, and unhappiness, and conclude in nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“To the bodhisattvas mahāsattvas they taught the Dharma that commences with the six perfections and the highest, complete enlightenment, and concludes with omniscient wisdom.</p>
<p>“Ajita, in this way, when the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa was previously a young man living in the capital, who had not yet entered homelessness, he had eight sons. The names of those princes were Mati, Sumati, Anantamati, Ratnamati, Viśeṣamati, Vi­mati­samuddhāṭin, Ghoṣamati, and Dharmamati.</p>
<p>“Ajita, those eight princes who were the sons of Bhagavān Candra­sūrya­pradīpa had great miraculous powers. Each one of them acquired and possessed four great continents and was the king of them. When they knew that the Bhagavān had abandoned the capital and heard that he had attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, they forsook all royal enjoyments and followed the Bhagavān into homelessness, and they all became dedicated to the highest, complete enlightenment and became dharmabhāṇakas. Those princes constantly maintained celibacy and planted roots of merit with many hundreds of thousands of buddhas.</p>
<p>“Ajita, when the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa had taught the Dharma teaching of the great extensive sūtra called The Great Elucidation, which is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas, then at that time, at that instant, that very moment, among that gathered assembly, sitting cross-legged upon the great Dharma seat, he rested in meditation in the samādhi named the basis of infinite elucidation; his body became motionless and his mind became motionless.</p>
<p>“As soon as the Bhagavān rested in meditation there fell onto the Bhagavān a great rain of coral tree flowers, great coral tree flowers, spider lily flowers, great spider lily flowers, and divine flowers, which were scattered upon the Bhagavān and his assembly.</p>
<p>“The complete buddha realm shook in six ways: it moved, moved strongly, quaked, quaked strongly, shuddered, and shuddered strongly. Then at that time the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, the upāsakas and upāsikās, the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, kings of regions, cakravartins, and cakravartins of the four continents, together with their retinues who were gathered in that assembly, were all gazing upon the Bhagavān with wonder, amazement, and joy.</p>
<p>“Also at that time, a light ray shone from the ūrṇā hair between the Bhagavān’s eyebrows to twenty thousand buddha realms in the eastern direction. The light of that light ray pervaded all those buddha realms. Ajita, it was just like how these buddha realms are illuminated now.</p>
<p>“Ajita, at that time, there were two hundred million bodhisattvas among the Bhagavān’s followers; those who were listening to the Dharma in that assembly saw the world illuminated by the radiance of that great light ray and were amazed, astonished, and intrigued.</p>
<p>“Ajita, at that time, in that Bhagavān’s teaching there was a bodhisattva mahāsattva named Varaprabha who had eight hundred students. The Bhagavān arose from that samādhi and taught the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, first to the bodhisattva Varaprabha. For sixty whole intermediate eons he taught while sitting on the one seat with a motionless body and a motionless mind. The entire assembly also remained seated on the same seats with motionless bodies and motionless minds, listening to the Dharma from the Bhagavān for sixty eons. There was not a single being within that assembly who became fatigued and there were none whose minds became wearied.</p>
<p>“When the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa had taught for sixty intermediate eons the Dharma teaching of the great extensive sūtra called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, which is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas, then in that moment he announced his parinirvāṇa in front of the world with its many beings, including devas, māras, and Brahmā. He said, ‘Bhikṣus, tonight at midnight the tathāgata will pass away into the state of nirvāṇa that has no remainder of the skandhas.’</p>
<p>“Then, Ajita, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa gave the prophecy of the highest, complete enlightenment to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Śrīgarbha and declared to the assembly, ‘Bhikṣus, this bodhisattva mahāsattva Śrīgarbha will after me attain the highest, complete enlightenment and become the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Vimalanetra.’</p>
<p>“Then, Ajita, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­pradīpa that evening at midnight passed away into the state of nirvāṇa that has no remainder of the skandhas. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Śrīgarbha took up the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma and for eighty intermediate eons taught the teaching of that bhagavān who had passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Ajita, the eight sons of that bhagavān, such as Mati, became students of the bodhisattva Śrīgarbha. He ripened them for the highest, complete enlightenment. Subsequently they all saw a hundred thousand quintillion buddhas, honored them, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. The last of them became the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Dīpaṃkara.</p>
<p>“One of the eight hundred students yearned for gain, yearned for honor, yearned for prestige, and desired fame, so the words and letters that had been taught did not engross him or take root in him. He became known as Yaśaskāma. Through the merit he had previously acquired, he pleased many quintillions of buddhas, and having pleased them he honored them, venerated them, respected them, made offerings to them, worshiped them, and revered them.</p>
<p>“At that time, Ajita, the bodhisattva Śrīgarbha was a dharmabhāṇaka. Do not have any doubt or uncertainty that he was someone else. Why is that? It is because at that time I was the dharmabhāṇaka Śrīgarbha. The bodhisattva Yaśaskāma had become lazy. Ajita, at that time, on that occasion, you were the lazy bodhisattva Yaśaskāma.</p>
<p>“Ajita, when in this teaching I saw the light ray of this kind that was the Bhagavān’s omen, I thought that the Bhagavān intended to teach the great extensive sūtra, the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta taught that meaning extensively, at that time reciting these verses:</p>
<p>“I remember a time in the past,</p>
<p>Inconceivable, innumerable eons ago,</p>
<p>When there was a jina, a supreme being,</p>
<p>Whose name was Candra­sūrya­pradīpa. {57}</p>
<p>“That guide of beings taught the good Dharma</p>
<p>And guided countless millions of beings.</p>
<p>He established many countless billions</p>
<p>Of bodhisattvas in wisdom. {58}</p>
<p>“When that guide had been a prince,</p>
<p>He had eight sons at that time.</p>
<p>When they saw the great muni’s renunciation</p>
<p>They gave up all desires and themselves became renunciants. {59}</p>
<p>“That lord of the world taught the Dharma,</p>
<p>The Supreme Infinite Teaching Sūtra.</p>
<p>It was also named The Very Extensive Sūtra,</p>
<p>And he taught it to billions of beings. {60}</p>
<p>“As soon as that guide had taught</p>
<p>He sat cross-legged, and in that instant</p>
<p>The best of munis, sitting on the Dharma throne,</p>
<p>Meditated in the samādhi of the supreme infinite teaching. {61}</p>
<p>“There fell a rain of divine flowers and coral tree flowers,</p>
<p>There was the sound of drums without drums being beaten,</p>
<p>And devas and yakṣas were present in the sky,</p>
<p>Making offerings to the supreme human. {62}</p>
<p>“At that moment the entire world shook.</p>
<p>There was then this wonder and marvel:</p>
<p>The Guide emitted a single, very beautiful</p>
<p>Ray of light from between his eyebrows. {63}</p>
<p>“That ray of light shone into the east</p>
<p>And illuminated and beautified all the worlds</p>
<p>In the entirety of eighteen thousand realms,</p>
<p>Revealing the deaths and births of beings. {64}</p>
<p>“Some realms that were made of jewels,</p>
<p>And some that were the color of beryl,</p>
<p>And various beautiful realms were revealed</p>
<p>Through the power of the Guide’s light ray. {65}</p>
<p>“The devas and humans, the yakṣas and nāgas,</p>
<p>The apsarases, gandharvas, and kinnaras</p>
<p>Who were engaged in offering to the Sugata,</p>
<p>Were revealed to also be offering in those realms. {66}</p>
<p>“The self-arisen buddhas themselves were visible,</p>
<p>As beautiful as pillars of gold.</p>
<p>Like gold in the midst of beryls,</p>
<p>They taught the Dharma in the midst of their followers. {67}</p>
<p>“The śrāvakas there were beyond number;</p>
<p>Those śrāvakas of the sugatas were numberless.</p>
<p>All in each of those realms of those guides</p>
<p>Were made visible by the light of the light ray. {68}</p>
<p>“Children of the lords of men were revealed</p>
<p>Who were residing and practicing in the mountains,</p>
<p>Who were diligent, with unimpaired conduct,</p>
<p>Had faultless conduct, and were like precious jewels. {69}</p>
<p>“Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges</p>
<p>Were all revealed by that light ray.</p>
<p>They had given away all their possessions,</p>
<p>Were resolute, had the power of patience, and delighted in meditation. {70}</p>
<p>“The heart children of the sugatas were revealed;</p>
<p>They were immovable and unshakable,</p>
<p>Patient, delighting in meditation, and resting in samādhi,</p>
<p>Established through meditation in the highest enlightenment. {71}</p>
<p>“Those at the level of true peace, who were without defilements</p>
<p>And who had great knowledge, were revealed.</p>
<p>They also taught the Dharma in many worlds,</p>
<p>Having such an activity through the power of the sugatas. {72}</p>
<p>“When the fourfold assembly of protectors</p>
<p>Saw this power of Candrārkadīpa,</p>
<p>They all were filled with joy</p>
<p>And asked each other, ‘What is this?’ {73}</p>
<p>“Not long after the humans, maruts, and yakṣas made offerings,</p>
<p>The Guide of the World arose from samādhi</p>
<p>And he said at that time these words to Varaprabha,</p>
<p>The wise dharmabhāṇaka bodhisattva: {74}</p>
<p>“ ‘You who are wise, who are the eyes and path for the world,</p>
<p>You who are a trustworthy holder of my Dharma,</p>
<p>You who have been a witness to my Dharma treasure,</p>
<p>Teach it so that it will be of benefit to beings.’ {75}</p>
<p>“The numerous bodhisattvas were heartened by this,</p>
<p>Were filled with joy, and praised and lauded him.</p>
<p>Then throughout an entire sixty intermediate eons</p>
<p>That jina taught the supreme Dharma. {76}</p>
<p>“The supreme highest Dharma that the protector of the world</p>
<p>Taught while he was seated upon a single seat,</p>
<p>All of it was held by the son of the jina,</p>
<p>By the dharmabhāṇaka Varaprabha. {77}</p>
<p>“That jina taught the supreme Dharma</p>
<p>And brought happiness to many beings.</p>
<p>Then on that day the guide declared</p>
<p>Before the whole world and its devas: {78}</p>
<p>“ ‘I have taught this method of the Dharma;</p>
<p>I have explained exactly the nature of the Dharma.</p>
<p>Bhikṣus, today is the time of my nirvāṇa—</p>
<p>It will be at midnight on this night. {79}</p>
<p>“ ‘Be dedicated to this my teaching,</p>
<p>Attentively, and with deep faith;</p>
<p>Even during the passing of a quintillion eons</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a jina, a great rishi.’ {80}</p>
<p>“As soon as they heard the word nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Spoken by that supreme human,</p>
<p>The many children of the Buddha were distressed</p>
<p>And they experienced the greatest suffering. {81}</p>
<p>“The king, the lord of humans,</p>
<p>Reassured the countless millions of beings:</p>
<p>‘Bhikṣus, do not be afraid of my nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>There will come a buddha after me. {82}</p>
<p>“ ‘This wise bodhisattva Śrīgarbha,</p>
<p>Who has realized the immaculate wisdom,</p>
<p>Will reach the highest, supreme enlightenment,</p>
<p>And he will become the jina Vimalāṅganetra.’ {83}</p>
<p>“At midnight of that night, causes ended</p>
<p>And he was extinguished like a flame.</p>
<p>His relics were very extensive;</p>
<p>There were endless quintillions of stūpas. {84}</p>
<p>“The bhikṣus and likewise the bhikṣuṇīs</p>
<p>Who were established in the path to supreme enlightenment</p>
<p>And were dedicated to the teaching of that Sugata</p>
<p>Were not few, but were as numerous as the Ganges sands. {85}</p>
<p>“At the time, the dharmabhāṇaka bhikṣu</p>
<p>Varaprabha, who held his teaching,</p>
<p>Taught the supreme Dharma of that teaching</p>
<p>During the entirety of eighty intermediate eons. {86}</p>
<p>“He had eight hundred students,</p>
<p>And he ripened all of them.</p>
<p>They saw many millions of buddhas</p>
<p>And they honored those great sages. {87}</p>
<p>“During that time, they practiced appropriately</p>
<p>And then they became buddhas in many worlds.</p>
<p>One after another, according to their sequence,</p>
<p>They prophesied the next one’s supreme enlightenment. {88}</p>
<p>“In that succession of buddhas</p>
<p>The last one was Dīpaṃkara,</p>
<p>The sage, supreme deva, revered by multitudes,</p>
<p>Who guided ten billion beings. {89}</p>
<p>“In the past, the Sugata’s son</p>
<p>Who taught the Dharma, Varaprabha,</p>
<p>Had a student who was idle and covetous</p>
<p>And desirous of gain and the prestige of knowledge. {90}</p>
<p>“He had an overwhelming longing for fame</p>
<p>And wandered from town to town.</p>
<p>He thus received the entire recitation of the teaching</p>
<p>But at that time he had not grasped the teaching. {91}</p>
<p>“He thus gained this name of Yaśaskāma,</p>
<p>Which became renowned everywhere.</p>
<p>And he, through having accomplished</p>
<p>This good karma that was adulterated, {92}</p>
<p>“He served ten billion buddhas</p>
<p>And made vast offerings to them.</p>
<p>Through thus practicing appropriately</p>
<p>He has here seen Buddha Śākyasiṃha. {93}</p>
<p>“He will here become one who is in his final lifetime</p>
<p>And will subsequently attain supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>He will become a bhagavān in the Maitreya family</p>
<p>And he will guide ten billion beings. {94}</p>
<p>“You were the one who, in that way,</p>
<p>Was the person idle during the time</p>
<p>Of the teaching of that sugata who had passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And at that time, I was the dharmabhāṇaka. {95}</p>
<p>“I, through that cause and that basis,</p>
<p>Have seen today the same kind of omen</p>
<p>As the celebrated omen of the wisdom,</p>
<p>Which I previously saw at that time. {96}</p>
<p>“The constant Lord of Jinas with all-seeing eyes,</p>
<p>The Śākya emperor who has seen the ultimate truth,</p>
<p>Also has the wish to speak and to give</p>
<p>The supreme teaching that I heard at that time. {97}</p>
<p>“That omen will today be fulfilled:</p>
<p>Śākyasiṃha will be establishing</p>
<p>The skillful method of the guides;</p>
<p>The seal on the nature of phenomena will be taught. {98}</p>
<p>“Be dedicated, have good aspiration, and place palms together;</p>
<p>The compassion that benefits the world will be taught.</p>
<p>An endless rain of the Dharma will fall,</p>
<p>Which will please those who are established in the cause of enlightenment. {99}</p>
<p>“Whatever doubts there may be,</p>
<p>Whatever uncertainty or vacillation</p>
<p>They will be eliminated in those born from wisdom,</p>
<p>In the bodhisattvas fixed upon enlightenment.” {100}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Introduction,” the first chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Skill in Methods</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān mindfully and knowingly arose from that samādhi. Having arisen from it, he addressed Brother Śāriputra.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the wisdom of the buddhas, which is profound, difficult to see, and difficult to understand, has been realized by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas. It is difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas to know. Why is that? Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas have served many hundred thousand quintillions of buddhas; they have practiced for the highest, complete enlightenment with many hundred thousand quintillions of buddhas; they have followed them for a long time; they have been diligent; they have obtained marvelous, amazing Dharma; and they know the Dharma that is difficult to know.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, it is difficult to know the true meaning of the teachings given by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas. Why is that? They teach the Dharma that they have understood themselves though a diversity of skillful methods, visions of wisdom, illustrations of causes and reasons, supports, expressions, and modes of communication. Through these skills in methods, they liberate this and that being, here and there, from attachment. Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas have reached the perfection of great skill in methods and the highest vision of wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas are endowed with the wonderful dharmas of the strength of the unimpeded, unobstructed vision of wisdom, as well as the fearlessnesses, the unique qualities, the powers, the strengths, the aspects of enlightenment, the dhyānas, the liberations, the samādhis, and the samāpattis, and they teach a variety of Dharma teachings.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas have obtained that which is a great marvel. Śāriputra, it is enough to say just that. Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas have obtained that which is a supreme marvel.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas should teach the dharmas of the tathāgatas themselves, which are the dharmas that tathāgatas know.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas teach all dharmas. The tathāgatas know all dharmas.</p>
<p>“They know what those dharmas are, the way they are, their characteristics and their nature just as those dharmas are, the way those dharmas are, the characteristics those dharmas have, and the nature of those dharmas.”</p>
<p>At that time, the Bhagavān then taught that topic in detail by speaking these verses:</p>
<p>“There have been countless great heroes</p>
<p>In the world with its maruts and humans,</p>
<p>But all those beings were unable to know</p>
<p>Those guides in their entirety. {1}</p>
<p>“No one is able to know</p>
<p>The nature of their strengths,</p>
<p>Liberations, fearlessnesses,</p>
<p>Or the nature of the buddhas’ other dharmas. {2}</p>
<p>“In the past their practice</p>
<p>In the presence of millions of buddhas</p>
<p>Was profound and subtle,</p>
<p>Difficult to know and difficult to see. {3}</p>
<p>“They practiced bodhisattva conduct</p>
<p>For countless millions of eons.</p>
<p>And I have perfectly seen</p>
<p>At the Bodhimaṇḍa its result. {4}</p>
<p>“Like the guides in other worlds</p>
<p>I have the knowledge of it</p>
<p>In exactly the way that it is</p>
<p>And its exact characteristics. {5}</p>
<p>“It cannot be taught.</p>
<p>Its description cannot be known,</p>
<p>Except by bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who maintain aspiration for it; {6}</p>
<p>“There are no other beings</p>
<p>Present in the worlds</p>
<p>To whom this Dharma is taught</p>
<p>And who know this teaching. {7}</p>
<p>“The wisdom of the jinas is beyond the scope</p>
<p>Even of the śrāvakas following the knower of the world,</p>
<p>Who have served him well and been praised by the Sugata,</p>
<p>Whose defilements have ceased and who are in their last bodies. {8}</p>
<p>“If all of those worlds were filled</p>
<p>With beings who were the same as Śāriputra</p>
<p>And they all in unison contemplated it</p>
<p>They would still not understand the wisdom of the sugatas. {9}</p>
<p>“Even if those who were as wise as you</p>
<p>Were to fill all the ten directions,</p>
<p>And if all ten directions were also filled in that same way</p>
<p>By those who are my other śrāvakas, {10}</p>
<p>“And if they all today in unison</p>
<p>Were to contemplate the Sugata’s wisdom,</p>
<p>Even all of them together would still not know</p>
<p>The extent of my limitless buddha wisdom. {11}</p>
<p>“If pratyeka­buddhas who are without defilements,</p>
<p>Have sharp faculties, and are in their last bodies</p>
<p>Were to fill all the ten directions</p>
<p>Like reeds or a stand of bamboo, {12}</p>
<p>“And if they were in unison to contemplate</p>
<p>Just a fraction of my superior Dharma</p>
<p>For endless quintillions of eons,</p>
<p>They would still not understand its meaning. {13}</p>
<p>“If the ten directions were to be filled</p>
<p>By bodhisattvas who have newly entered the yāna,</p>
<p>Those who have served many millions of buddhas</p>
<p>And many dharmabhāṇakas of the definitive meaning, {14}</p>
<p>“If they filled all worlds like stands of bamboo</p>
<p>Uninterruptedly at all times,</p>
<p>And if for countless millions of eons</p>
<p>That are as innumerable as the Ganges sands {15}</p>
<p>“They were in unison to contemplate,</p>
<p>With subtle wisdom thinking of nothing else,</p>
<p>The Dharma that the Sugata has directly perceived,</p>
<p>It would still be beyond the scope of their understanding. {16}</p>
<p>“If bodhisattvas who are irreversible—</p>
<p>Not a few, but as numerous as the Ganges sands—</p>
<p>Were to contemplate this without a thought of anything else,</p>
<p>Even for them this would be beyond the scope of their knowledge. {17}</p>
<p>“The jinas in the worlds in the ten directions</p>
<p>Who understand the profound and very subtle Dharma,</p>
<p>Who are free of thinking and whose defilements have ceased,</p>
<p>Have for a long time been teaching this highest meaning. {18}</p>
<p>“Those jinas, those great sages teach nothing else</p>
<p>Than exactly this kind of knowledge that I have.</p>
<p>Śāriputra, you should have complete aspiration</p>
<p>For that which the tathāgatas are teaching. {19}</p>
<p>“I instruct all of these śrāvakas,</p>
<p>Those who are pratyeka­buddhas,</p>
<p>And those I have brought to nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>To liberate them from the continuity of suffering. {20}</p>
<p>“I teach many dharmas in the world</p>
<p>So that here and there I bring liberation from attachment.</p>
<p>I give the teaching of the three yānas,</p>
<p>Which is my supreme skill in methods.” {21}</p>
<p>In that assembly two hundred thousand great śrāvakas such as Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya, who were arhats, whose defilements had ceased and who had attained power, and also bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who followed the Śrāvakayāna, and also those who followed the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, all thought, “What is the cause and what is the reason why the Bhagavān has praised the skill in methods of the tathāgatas, and said, ‘This profound Dharma is the attainment of buddhahood’ and ‘It is difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas to understand it’? The Bhagavān has said there is but one liberation, and we have obtained the Buddha’s Dharma and we have attained nirvāṇa, and yet we do not know the meaning of what the Bhagavān has said.”</p>
<p>Brother Śāriputra, knowing that the fourfold retinue was uncertain and in doubt, at that time said these words to the Bhagavān: “Bhagavān, what is the cause and what is the reason why the Bhagavān has in this way repeatedly praised the teaching of the Dharma of being wise in skill in methods, and repeatedly said, ‘I have realized this profound Dharma’ and ‘It is difficult to know the intended meaning of the teaching’? I have never before heard this Dharma teaching from the Bhagavān. Also the fourfold retinue is uncertain and in doubt. What is the Tathāgata’s intended meaning? I request that the Bhagavān explain perfectly the profound Dharma of the tathāgatas, of which you have repeatedly spoken.”</p>
<p>Then at that time Brother Śāriputra recited these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘I have obtained countless strengths,</p>
<p>Liberations, and dhyānas’—</p>
<p>Sun of humans, for a long time today</p>
<p>You have spoken words of this kind. {22}</p>
<p>“You are speaking about the Bodhimaṇḍa</p>
<p>Without anyone asking you to.</p>
<p>You are speaking about intended meaning</p>
<p>Without anyone asking you about it. {23}</p>
<p>“Without anyone asking you to speak of it</p>
<p>You are praising your own conduct.</p>
<p>You speak of your attainment of wisdom</p>
<p>And you declare it to be profound. {24}</p>
<p>“Those with power, whose defilements have ceased,</p>
<p>And those established in nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Are today in uncertainty,</p>
<p>Wondering what the Jina is saying. {25}</p>
<p>“Those who are intent on pratyeka­buddhahood,</p>
<p>And the bhikṣus and likewise bhikṣuṇīs,</p>
<p>The devas, nāgas, and yakṣas,</p>
<p>And the gandharvas and mahoragas, {26}</p>
<p>“They are uncertain, analyzing,</p>
<p>Talking among themselves,</p>
<p>And gazing at the supreme human.</p>
<p>Great sage, give us your elucidation. {27}</p>
<p>“Within the teaching of the highest sage</p>
<p>I am supreme among the entirety</p>
<p>Of all the Tathāgata’s śrāvakas</p>
<p>Who are present here. {28}</p>
<p>“And yet I am myself still uncertain,</p>
<p>Supreme human, of your point.</p>
<p>How conclusive is my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Or the practice I have been taught? {29}</p>
<p>“Emit the sound of the supreme drum</p>
<p>By relating the nature of this Dharma.</p>
<p>The heart children of the Jina are present here,</p>
<p>Gazing at the Jina with hands together in homage. {30}</p>
<p>“There are devas and nāgas together with yakṣas and rākṣasas</p>
<p>In many billions, as numerous as the Ganges sands.</p>
<p>There are eighty thousand present of those</p>
<p>Who are intent upon supreme enlightenment. {31}</p>
<p>“There are great monarchs, cakravartin kings</p>
<p>Who have come from billions of realms.</p>
<p>They have respectfully placed their hands together.</p>
<p>How can we make our practice perfect?” {32}</p>
<p>When Śāriputra had thus spoken, the Bhagavān asked him, “Śāriputra, why should I teach this? What would be the reason? Śāriputra, if I were to teach the meaning of this, it would alarm this world with its devas.”</p>
<p>Then Brother Śāriputra for a second time made his request to the Bhagavān, saying, “Bhagavān, I request that you teach this meaning. I request that the Sugata teach it. Why is that? Bhagavān, in this assembly there are many hundreds of beings, many thousands of beings, many hundred thousands of beings, many hundred thousand quintillions of beings, who have seen past buddhas and are endowed with wisdom, and they will have faith in the teaching of the Bhagavān, will have conviction in it, and will uphold it.”</p>
<p>Then at that time Brother Śāriputra recited this verse:</p>
<p>“There are thousands of beings in this assembly</p>
<p>Who have faith in, delight in, and venerate the Sugata,</p>
<p>And they will understand the Dharma that you teach.</p>
<p>Therefore, king and lord of humans, I request that you clearly teach.” {33}</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said a second time to Brother Śāriputra. “Śāriputra, if I were to teach the meaning of this it would alarm this world with its devas, and it would cause bhikṣus who have great pride to fall into a great abyss.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“I have taught enough of this Dharma.</p>
<p>This wisdom is subtle and cannot be analyzed.</p>
<p>There are many present who are foolish and proud.</p>
<p>They will not understand and will reject my teaching.” {34}</p>
<p>Then Brother Śāriputra made a third request to the Bhagavān, saying, “I request that the Bhagavān teach. I request that the Sugata teach. Bhagavān, in this assembly there are many hundreds who are like me. Bhagavān, there are many hundreds of such beings, many thousands of such beings, many hundred thousands of such beings, many hundred thousand quintillions of such beings, and there are others who were ripened by the Bhagavān in their previous existences. They will have faith in, have conviction in, and will uphold the Bhagavān’s teaching, and for a long time it will bring them benefit, welfare, and happiness.”</p>
<p>Then at that time Brother Śāriputra recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Supreme human, teach the Dharma.</p>
<p>I, your senior son, make this request to you.</p>
<p>Here there are present billions of beings</p>
<p>Who will have faith in the Dharma you teach. {35}</p>
<p>“These beings, who in their previous lives</p>
<p>You constantly ripened over a very long time,</p>
<p>Are all standing here with hands in homage.</p>
<p>They will have faith in this Dharma. {36}</p>
<p>“There are twelve hundred here who are like me,</p>
<p>Who are established in the highest enlightenment.</p>
<p>Sugata, regard them and give your teaching</p>
<p>So that they will experience the highest happiness.” {37}</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān, knowing Brother Śāriputra had made this request for the third time, said these words to Brother Śāriputra: “Śāriputra, now that you have made this request to the Tathāgata three times, I have said what I had to say about your request. Therefore, Śāriputra, listen carefully and remember, for I will give you the teaching.”</p>
<p>As soon as the Bhagavān had consented, more than five thousand arrogant bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās within that assembly rose from their seats, bowed down their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, and departed from the assembly. As a result of their arrogance they believed that they had obtained roots of merit when they had not obtained them, and believed they had realization when they did not have realization. They had become aware of their own error and departed from that assembly, the Bhagavān giving his permission to do so by remaining silent.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, my assembly has become free of its dregs. Śāriputra, it has become free of those who were worthless, while those for whom faith is essential remain. It is good that those who are arrogant have departed. Therefore, Śāriputra, I shall teach that meaning.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Bhagavān!” Śāriputra replied, and he listened to the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra,” said the Bhagavān, “a tathāgata rarely teaches this kind of Dharma. Śāriputra, just as fig tree flowers rarely appear, a tathāgata rarely teaches this kind of Dharma. Śāriputra, believe me, I am speaking the truth. I am speaking correctly. I am not speaking otherwise.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas’ teaching that contains an inner meaning is difficult to understand. Why is that? Śāriputra, I teach the Dharma by using various definitions, expressions, and parables, using hundreds of thousands of different skillful methods.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, that Dharma cannot be analyzed. It is beyond the scope of sophists; it is what is known by a tathāgata. Why is that? Śāriputra, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into the world in order to perform one deed, one action: a great deed and a great action.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, what is a tathāgata’s one deed and one action, his great deed and great action, for which a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into the world? A tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world for the sake of causing beings to acquire the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. A tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order to reveal to beings the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. A tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order that beings will enter the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. A tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order that beings will realize the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. A tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world in order that beings will enter the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, a tathāgata appears in this world for that one deed and one action, for that one great deed and one great action, and with that one intention.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, in that way a tathāgata accomplishes that one deed and one action, that one great deed and great action of the tathāgatas. Why is that? Śāriputra, I cause the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. I reveal the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. Śāriputra, I cause entry into the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. Śāriputra, I cause the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom. Śāriputra, I cause entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, I also I teach the Dharma to beings through a single yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, ultimate omniscience. There are no second or third yānas.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, this is the true nature everywhere in all worlds in the ten directions. Why is that? Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who in the past have appeared in countless, innumerable worlds in the ten directions have known the thoughts that are the various aspirations, natures, and intentions of beings. For the sake of many beings, for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, and with compassion for the world, for the sake of a great number of beings, and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans, they taught the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment, and various teachings on causes, reasons, parables, supports, and skillful methods.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas taught the Dharma to beings through a single yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, ultimate omniscience. It is the teaching of the Dharma that causes the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, reveals the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes entry into the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, and causes entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all the beings who heard that Dharma from those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in the past attained the highest, supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who in the future will appear in countless, innumerable worlds in the ten directions will also know the thoughts that are the various aspirations, natures, and intentions of beings. For the sake of many beings, for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, and with compassion for the world, for the sake of a great number of beings, and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans, they will teach the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment, and various teachings on causes, reasons, parables, supports, and skillful methods.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas will teach the Dharma to beings through a single yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, ultimate omniscience. It is the teaching of the Dharma that causes the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, reveals the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes entry into the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, and causes entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all the beings who hear that Dharma from those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in the future will attain the highest, supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who in the present have appeared in countless, innumerable worlds in the ten directions also know the thoughts that are the various aspirations, natures, and intentions of beings. For the sake of many beings, for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, and with compassion for the world, for the sake of a great number of beings, and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans, they teach the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment, and various teachings on causes, reasons, parables, supports, and skillful methods.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas teach the Dharma to beings through a single yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, ultimate omniscience. It is the teaching of the Dharma that causes the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, reveals the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes entry into the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, and causes entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all the beings who hear that Dharma from those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas will attain the highest, supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, in that same way, I am a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha who knows the thoughts that are the various aspirations, natures, and intentions of beings. For the sake of many beings, for the benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, and with compassion for the world, for the sake of a great number of beings, and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans, I teach the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment, and various teachings on causes, reasons, parables, supports, and skillful methods.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, I also teach the Dharma to beings through a single yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, ultimate omniscience. It is the teaching of the Dharma that causes the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, reveals the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes entry into the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, causes the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, and causes entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, all the beings who now hear that Dharma from me will also attain the highest, supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, know that in this teaching there is no second yāna anywhere in any world in the ten directions, so how could there be a third?</p>
<p>“However, when tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas appear during the degeneration of an eon, or when there is the degeneration of beings, degeneration through the kleśas, degeneration of view, or degeneration of lifespan, then, Śāriputra, when there is that turmoil of the degeneration of the era, many defilements, and beings have craving and few roots of merit, then, Śāriputra, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas with skill in methods teach that single Buddhayāna as a teaching of three yānas.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, those śrāvakas, arhats, and pratyeka­buddhas who do not listen to, do not engage in, and do not comprehend the activity of the tathāgatas that causes the acquisition of the Buddhayāna, you should know that they, Śāriputra, are not śrāvakas of the Buddha, and you should know that they are not his arhats or pratyeka­buddhas.</p>
<p>“Also, Śāriputra, those bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs who vow to become arhats do not possess the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment. They say, ‘I have cut myself off from the Buddhayāna; this is my last existence, my nirvāṇa.’</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, know them to be arrogant. Why is that? Śāriputra, it is impossible that a bhikṣu arhat, whose defilements have ceased, who hears this Dharma in the presence of the Tathāgata, will be unable to have faith in it, unless it is after the Tathāgata’s nirvāṇa. Why is that? Śāriputra, at the time, after the Tathāgata’s nirvāṇa, these śrāvakas will not preserve or teach this kind of sūtra.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, they will have no doubt concerning this Dharma teaching from other tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas. Śāriputra, have faith in me, trust in me, and have confidence in me.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgatas do not lie. This one yāna, Śāriputra, is the Buddhayāna.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha taught this topic in detail by reciting these verses:</p>
<p>“The arrogant bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs,</p>
<p>Upāsakas, and upāsikās</p>
<p>Who are devoid of faith</p>
<p>Number no fewer than five hundred. {38}</p>
<p>“Having impaired training,</p>
<p>They saw this wrong of theirs,</p>
<p>And concealing their flaws,</p>
<p>The foolish ones departed. {39}</p>
<p>“They do not have the good karma</p>
<p>For listening to this Dharma.</p>
<p>Knowing them to be the very dregs of this assembly</p>
<p>I, the Lord of the World, gave them leave. {40}</p>
<p>“Those now present in my assembly</p>
<p>Are pure and free of the chaff.</p>
<p>All who are extraneous have departed</p>
<p>And these who remain are the essence. {41}</p>
<p>“Listen to me, Śārisuta! The supreme beings,</p>
<p>The guides, the buddhas have taught</p>
<p>The perfect Dharma of the buddhas</p>
<p>With many hundreds of skillful methods. {42}</p>
<p>“In that way I know the thoughts and the conduct</p>
<p>And the many aspirations of millions of beings,</p>
<p>And I know their various kinds of karma,</p>
<p>And the good actions they have previously accomplished, {43}</p>
<p>“And I shall make those beings understand</p>
<p>Through various definitions and reasons,</p>
<p>And through hundreds of causes and parables,</p>
<p>And in those ways I will please beings. {44}</p>
<p>“I teach through prose and likewise verse,</p>
<p>Histories, my previous lifetimes, accounts of miracles,</p>
<p>Prologues, hundreds of different analogies,</p>
<p>Prose put into verse, and similarly elucidations. {45}</p>
<p>“I give the teaching of nirvāṇa to those</p>
<p>Who lack wisdom, who are attracted to inferior paths,</p>
<p>Who do not practice the way of the many millions of buddhas,</p>
<p>Who are clinging to saṃsāra and suffer deeply. {46}</p>
<p>“A self-arisen one performs this method</p>
<p>So that the wisdom of buddhahood may be realized.</p>
<p>But I have never said to them,</p>
<p>‘You will become buddhas in this world.’ {47}</p>
<p>“Why is that? The Protector waits for an appropriate time,</p>
<p>And when he sees that time has come he teaches it.</p>
<p>That appropriate time has somehow arrived today</p>
<p>And that is why I shall teach the definitive truth. {48}</p>
<p>“My teaching has nine aspects,</p>
<p>Which are taught according to the strengths of beings.</p>
<p>I teach with this method so that they will approach</p>
<p>The supreme gift that is wisdom. {49}</p>
<p>“I give the teaching of the extensive sūtras</p>
<p>To those bodhisattvas who are always pure,</p>
<p>Who are wise, unsullied, and gentle,</p>
<p>Who have served many millions of buddhas. {50}</p>
<p>“As their aspirations are fulfilled</p>
<p>And they have purity of conduct,</p>
<p>I say that they will be in a future time</p>
<p>Beneficial and compassionate buddhas. {51}</p>
<p>“Hearing so, they all are filled with joy,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘We will become buddhas, supreme among beings.’</p>
<p>And also, knowing their attitude,</p>
<p>I give them the teaching of the extensive sūtras. {52}</p>
<p>“Those śrāvakas of the Guide who in this way</p>
<p>Have heard this teaching of mine,</p>
<p>They who have heard or retained even one verse,</p>
<p>Will all, without doubt, attain enlightenment. {53}</p>
<p>“Apart from the skillful methods of supreme beings</p>
<p>Who give the teaching of separate yānas,</p>
<p>There is only one yāna; there is no second,</p>
<p>And there is never in the world a third. {54}</p>
<p>“A lord of the world appears in the world</p>
<p>In order to teach the wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>That is his one activity, there is no second:</p>
<p>The buddhas do not guide beings with a lesser yāna. {55}</p>
<p>“A self-arisen one establishes beings</p>
<p>In that in which he is himself established:</p>
<p>In that very same buddhahood,</p>
<p>In the strengths, dhyānas, liberations, and powers. {56}</p>
<p>“If having attained preeminent, stainless enlightenment</p>
<p>I were then to establish even one being</p>
<p>In a lesser yāna, that would not be good:</p>
<p>I would have the fault of stinginess. {57}</p>
<p>“I do not have the slightest stinginess;</p>
<p>I have no envy and no desire.</p>
<p>I have eliminated every bad quality.</p>
<p>I am a buddha and I understand beings. {58}</p>
<p>“Just as the signs I am adorned by</p>
<p>Illuminate all these worlds,</p>
<p>I give the teaching of this seal of the Dharma’s nature</p>
<p>To the many hundreds of beings who are before me. {59}</p>
<p>“This is what I think of, Śāriputra:</p>
<p>‘How may all beings become</p>
<p>Possessed of a body with the thirty-two signs</p>
<p>And be self-luminous, self-arising knowers of the world?’ {60}</p>
<p>“Just as I saw and just as I thought,</p>
<p>And just as I resolved in the past,</p>
<p>My aspirations have been fulfilled</p>
<p>And I teach enlightenment and buddhahood. {61}</p>
<p>“If, Śārisuta, I were to say to beings,</p>
<p>‘Develop the desire for buddhahood,’</p>
<p>All who are ignorant would be bewildered</p>
<p>And they would not follow my good advice. {62}</p>
<p>“I have the knowledge of their nature;</p>
<p>They have not practiced the way in previous lifetimes.</p>
<p>They have attachment and cling to sensory pleasures.</p>
<p>They are stupefied by craving and bewildered by ignorance. {63}</p>
<p>“Desire causes them to fall into the lower existences.</p>
<p>They are tormented within the six existences.</p>
<p>They increase the charnel grounds over and over.</p>
<p>They have little merit and are tortured by suffering. {64}</p>
<p>“They constantly cling to the darkness of wrong views:</p>
<p>That things exist, do not exist, and similarly both exist and do not exist.</p>
<p>They rely upon the sixty-two fabricated views.</p>
<p>They remain fixated upon things that have no reality. {65}</p>
<p>“They are treacherous, conceited, and incorrigible.</p>
<p>They are crooked, deceitful, fools with little learning.</p>
<p>Throughout billions of their lifetimes</p>
<p>They never hear these words from a buddha. {66}</p>
<p>“Śārisuta, I teach to them the method</p>
<p>That will bring an end to their suffering.</p>
<p>On seeing beings tortured by suffering</p>
<p>I then give to them the teaching of nirvāṇa. {67}</p>
<p>“Thus I give all these Dharma teachings</p>
<p>Of eternal nirvāṇa and primordial peace,</p>
<p>While a bodhisattva who has perfected his practice</p>
<p>Will in a future time become a jina. {68}</p>
<p>“Similarly, the three yānas that I teach</p>
<p>Are a skillful method of mine.</p>
<p>There is but one yāna, but one way—</p>
<p>There is but this one teaching of the guides. {69}</p>
<p>“Those of you here who have doubt about this</p>
<p>Should dispel your doubt and your uncertainty.</p>
<p>The guides of the world do not teach anything else.</p>
<p>There is but this one yāna; there is no second. {70}</p>
<p>“The tathāgatas who have appeared in the past,</p>
<p>The many thousands of buddhas who have entered nirvāṇa</p>
<p>In the countless eons of the past</p>
<p>Could never be enumerated. {71}</p>
<p>“All those supreme beings</p>
<p>Gave many pure Dharma teachings</p>
<p>Through parables, causes, and reasons,</p>
<p>And through hundreds of skillful methods. {72}</p>
<p>“All of them taught one yāna.</p>
<p>They brought countless billions</p>
<p>Of beings into that single yāna</p>
<p>And ripened them in that single yāna. {73}</p>
<p>“The tathāgatas, in a world with its devas,</p>
<p>Knowing the aspirations and thoughts of beings,</p>
<p>Are teaching this supreme Dharma</p>
<p>With other various methods of the jinas. {74}</p>
<p>“Those beings who in their presence</p>
<p>Are listening to the Dharma or have listened to it,</p>
<p>Who have practiced generosity, maintained good conduct,</p>
<p>Who have accomplished all practices with patience, {75}</p>
<p>“Who have served with diligence and meditation,</p>
<p>Who have contemplated with wisdom these Dharma teachings,</p>
<p>And have created various kinds of merit:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {76}</p>
<p>“Those beings who have followed the teaching</p>
<p>Of the jinas who have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And who are patient, peaceful, and self-controlled:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {77}</p>
<p>“Those who make offerings to the relics</p>
<p>Of the jinas who have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And have built countless thousands of stūpas</p>
<p>That are made of jewels, gold, and silver, {78}</p>
<p>“And of crystals, and of emeralds,</p>
<p>That are made from pearls and chrysoberyls,</p>
<p>Of the best beryls and likewise sapphires:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {79}</p>
<p>“Also those who make stūpas out of stone,</p>
<p>Those who make them from sandalwood and agarwood,</p>
<p>Those who make stūpas out of deodar cedar,</p>
<p>Those who make them from a combination of woods, {80}</p>
<p>“And those who with delight make stūpas of jinas</p>
<p>From bricks or build them from clay,</p>
<p>And those who for that purpose create them</p>
<p>In remote forests from piles of earth, {81}</p>
<p>“And those children playing here and there</p>
<p>Who pile up sand</p>
<p>So as to create stūpas of the jinas:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {82}</p>
<p>“Similarly those who have others work</p>
<p>In order to create the precious images</p>
<p>Of statues that possess the thirty-two signs:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {83}</p>
<p>“Those who make them from the seven precious materials,</p>
<p>Those who make them from copper and bronze,</p>
<p>Those who have made statues of the sugatas:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {84}</p>
<p>“Those who have representations of the sugatas made</p>
<p>From lead, from iron, or from clay,</p>
<p>Or beautifully painted on cloth:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {85}</p>
<p>“Those who paint their representations in murals,</p>
<p>Their entire bodies with a hundred signs of merit,</p>
<p>Whether they paint them themselves or have others do so:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {86}</p>
<p>“Also those, whether adults or children,</p>
<p>Who in learning, or for their own amusement</p>
<p>Or to entertain others, draw those images</p>
<p>On a wall with a fingernail or with a stick: {87}</p>
<p>“They will all of them attain enlightenment,</p>
<p>All of them will become compassionate,</p>
<p>All of them will liberate millions of beings,</p>
<p>And they will make many become bodhisattvas. {88}</p>
<p>“Those who make offerings of flowers and incense</p>
<p>To the relics of the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>To stūpas and images made of clay,</p>
<p>And to murals and stūpas made of earth; {89}</p>
<p>“Those who cause music to be played for them</p>
<p>With the pleasant sounds of ḍamarus, conches, and bherī drums;</p>
<p>Those who play well upon drums</p>
<p>As an offering to the perfectly enlightened ones; {90}</p>
<p>“Those who do so with melodious lutes, cymbals, and gongs,</p>
<p>Mṛdaṅga drums, single-stringed lutes, and flutes,</p>
<p>Which bring delight, and are pleasant to hear:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {91}</p>
<p>“Those who, in order to make offerings to the sugatas,</p>
<p>Make music with strings of little bells,</p>
<p>With bowls of water, by clapping their hands,</p>
<p>And with sweet, lovely well-sung songs— {92}</p>
<p>“Those who perform many kinds of offerings to the relics—</p>
<p>They will all become buddhas in the world.</p>
<p>Even those who make a little offering to the relics of a sugata,</p>
<p>Who play music on just one instrument, {93}</p>
<p>“Or make an offering with just one flower,</p>
<p>Or make an offering with a distracted mind</p>
<p>To the image of a sugata in a mural,</p>
<p>They will eventually see millions of buddhas. {94}</p>
<p>“Those who make the gesture of homage to a stūpa,</p>
<p>Either completely or even with just one hand;</p>
<p>Or bow their head for just an instant,</p>
<p>Or similarly bow their body just one time; {95}</p>
<p>“Or say ‘Homage to the Buddha’ just one time</p>
<p>To those containers of the relics—</p>
<p>Even those who do so once with a distracted mind—</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {96}</p>
<p>“Those beings who, at a time when the sugatas</p>
<p>Have passed into nirvāṇa or are present,</p>
<p>Have heard this Dharma teaching’s name:</p>
<p>They will all of them attain enlightenment. {97}</p>
<p>“The many millions of buddhas in the future,</p>
<p>Who are innumerable, beyond reckoning,</p>
<p>Those jinas, supreme lords of the world,</p>
<p>They will also teach these methods. {98}</p>
<p>“They who guide millions of beings</p>
<p>To the immaculate wisdom of buddhahood,</p>
<p>Those guides of the world</p>
<p>Will have infinite skill in methods. {99}</p>
<p>“There will never be even one being</p>
<p>Who has heard this Dharma teaching that will not become a buddha.</p>
<p>The prayer of the tathāgatas is:</p>
<p>‘Having followed the path, may I make others follow it for enlightenment.’ {100}</p>
<p>“They will teach in the future times</p>
<p>Many thousand millions of entrances to the Dharma.</p>
<p>In buddhahood, they will teach the Dharma</p>
<p>Through teaching this single yāna. {101}</p>
<p>“This way of the Dharma is always constant;</p>
<p>The nature of the Dharma is always illuminating.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the supreme humans, will know it</p>
<p>And will expound this single yāna of mine. {102}</p>
<p>“The constancy of the Dharma, the eternality of the Dharma</p>
<p>Is always constant, unfluctuating in this world.</p>
<p>The buddhas in the center of the earth</p>
<p>Will expound buddhahood and skillfulness in methods. {103}</p>
<p>“The buddhas, as numerous as the Ganges sands,</p>
<p>Present in the ten directions, to whom humans and devas make offerings,</p>
<p>Also teach this supreme yāna</p>
<p>For the sake of the happiness of all beings. {104}</p>
<p>“The buddhas expound skillfulness in methods,</p>
<p>And they teach different kinds of yānas.</p>
<p>They also elucidate the single yāna,</p>
<p>This supreme level of peace. {105}</p>
<p>“They teach through knowing the conduct of all beings</p>
<p>And similarly their thoughts and past practice,</p>
<p>Knowing their strengths and their diligence,</p>
<p>And through knowing their aspirations. {106}</p>
<p>“The guides, through the power of wisdom,</p>
<p>Teach many causes, parables, and supports.</p>
<p>Knowing the various aspirations of beings</p>
<p>They teach various kinds of practices. {107}</p>
<p>“At this time, I, the guide who is a Lord of Jinas,</p>
<p>Have also appeared so that beings may attain happiness.</p>
<p>I teach this enlightenment of buddhahood</p>
<p>Through billions of various kinds of practices. {108}</p>
<p>“Knowing the thoughts and aspirations of beings</p>
<p>I teach the Dharma in many different forms.</p>
<p>I gladden them through various methods:</p>
<p>That is the power of my own wisdom. {109}</p>
<p>“I also see that destitute beings</p>
<p>Are without wisdom and merit.</p>
<p>They are sunk in saṃsāra, enveloped in misery,</p>
<p>And immersed in a continuum of suffering. {110}</p>
<p>“Bound to craving, the fools are like yaks;</p>
<p>They are continually blinded by desire.</p>
<p>They do not seek buddhahood that has great power;</p>
<p>They do not search for the Dharma that ends suffering. {111}</p>
<p>“Their minds are impeded in the six existences,</p>
<p>They adhere unshakably to incorrect views,</p>
<p>They experience suffering after suffering.</p>
<p>I have powerful compassion for them. {112}</p>
<p>“Knowing this, I remained</p>
<p>At the Bodhimaṇḍa for three full weeks.</p>
<p>I contemplated this meaning in that way</p>
<p>While gazing there upon the tree. {113}</p>
<p>“I stared, without blinking, at the lord of trees</p>
<p>While walking to and fro beneath it.</p>
<p>‘This wisdom is preeminent and marvelous.</p>
<p>These beings are unwise and blinded by ignorance.’ {114}</p>
<p>“At that time I was entreated by Brahmā,</p>
<p>Śakra, the four world guardians,</p>
<p>And also Maheśvara and Īśvara,</p>
<p>And many billions of maruts. {115}</p>
<p>“They all stood respectfully with palms together.</p>
<p>I contemplated my goal and how to accomplish it:</p>
<p>‘If I speak the praises of enlightenment</p>
<p>To these beings who are oppressed by suffering, {116}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those with foolish minds will reject my Dharma,</p>
<p>And having rejected it, they will go to the lower realms.</p>
<p>It is best that I never say anything.</p>
<p>May I enter nirvāṇa, peace, on this very day.’ {117}</p>
<p>“I remembered the buddhas of the past</p>
<p>And the skill in methods that they had:</p>
<p>‘I too therefore shall teach this enlightenment</p>
<p>Of buddhahood divided into three categories.’ {118}</p>
<p>“I contemplated that meaning in this way,</p>
<p>And the other buddhas in the ten directions</p>
<p>Revealed their own bodies to me</p>
<p>And with their voices they declared, ‘Excellent! {119}</p>
<p>“ ‘Excellent, Muni, supreme Guide of the World,</p>
<p>Who, having attained the supreme wisdom,</p>
<p>Is contemplating skill in methods,</p>
<p>Following the way of the guides of worlds. {120}</p>
<p>“ ‘We also, having realized the highest state,</p>
<p>Are teaching through a division into three.</p>
<p>Humans with inferior aspiration and lacking knowledge</p>
<p>Will not believe us if we say, “You shall become buddhas.” {121}</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore we are employing skill in methods</p>
<p>Through a compilation of causes.</p>
<p>We are inspiring many bodhisattvas</p>
<p>By declaring what is the desired result.’ {122}</p>
<p>“I was filled with joy on having heard</p>
<p>The pleasant voices of the leaders of beings,</p>
<p>And filled with joy I said to those protectors,</p>
<p>‘Supreme great rishis, you speak meaningfully. {123}</p>
<p>“ ‘I too will act in the way that the wise ones,</p>
<p>The guides of the world, have described.’</p>
<p>I have also been born during this dreadful chaos,</p>
<p>In the midst of the degeneracy of beings. {124}</p>
<p>“And so, Śārisuta, knowing this,</p>
<p>At that time I walked to Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>There, applying a method, I taught the five bhikṣus</p>
<p>The Dharma that is the state of pacification. {125}</p>
<p>“Then my wheel of the Dharma was turned,</p>
<p>And the word nirvāṇa appeared in the world.</p>
<p>The word arhat and likewise the word Dharma</p>
<p>And the word saṅgha also appeared at that time. {126}</p>
<p>“I taught for numerous years,</p>
<p>Explaining the level of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>At all times I taught in this way:</p>
<p>‘This is the end of saṃsāra’s suffering.’ {127}</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, there came a time</p>
<p>When I saw infinite thousands of quintillions</p>
<p>Of offspring of the highest of humans</p>
<p>Who had set out for the supreme, highest enlightenment. {128}</p>
<p>“They who had arrived before me</p>
<p>Stood respectfully with palms together.</p>
<p>They had heard the Dharma from the jinas</p>
<p>And were skilled in many kinds of methods. {129}</p>
<p>“Then in that instant I had this thought:</p>
<p>‘The time has come for me to teach the highest Dharma.</p>
<p>It is for that purpose that I was born into this world</p>
<p>And I shall teach here the highest enlightenment. {130}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those with foolish understanding, who conceptualize characteristics,</p>
<p>Who have become arrogant and who are lacking in wisdom</p>
<p>Will on this day not have faith in it.</p>
<p>But these bodhisattvas will listen to me.’ {131}</p>
<p>“At that time, fearlessly and joyfully,</p>
<p>Having abandoned every hesitation,</p>
<p>I spoke in the middle of the offspring of the sugatas</p>
<p>And inspired them toward enlightenment. {132}</p>
<p>“Having seen children of the buddhas such as these,</p>
<p>You too should be one who has banished doubt.</p>
<p>These twelve hundred who have no defilements</p>
<p>Will all become buddhas in this world. {133}</p>
<p>“Just like the nature of the past protectors</p>
<p>And like that of the jinas in the future,</p>
<p>I too have eliminated conceptualization</p>
<p>And will teach you in that way today. {134}</p>
<p>“Sometimes, somewhere, somehow,</p>
<p>A leader of beings appears in a world.</p>
<p>When someone with infinite vision appears in a world</p>
<p>Then sometimes this kind of Dharma may be taught. {135}</p>
<p>“Even in a million trillion eons it will be</p>
<p>Very difficult to find a supreme Dharma such as this.</p>
<p>It will be very difficult to find beings such as these</p>
<p>Who listen to the supreme Dharma and believe in it. {136}</p>
<p>“They are as difficult to find as a fig tree flower</p>
<p>That is sometimes, somehow, somewhere seen.</p>
<p>It may be a beautiful sight for beings</p>
<p>And a marvel for the world and its devas. {137}</p>
<p>“Therefore, I will teach the greatest marvel,</p>
<p>And whoever hears this well-taught Dharma,</p>
<p>Rejoices, and recites just one word of it</p>
<p>Will have made an offering to all the buddhas. {138}</p>
<p>“Banish all doubt and uncertainty concerning this.</p>
<p>I, the King of the Dharma, shall proclaim it.</p>
<p>I shall guide toward the highest enlightenment;</p>
<p>Here, I have no śrāvakas whatsoever. {139}</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, you must keep this great secret.</p>
<p>And also all those who are my śrāvakas,</p>
<p>And these who are eminent bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>They must maintain this great secret of mine. {140}</p>
<p>“Why is that? In the time of five degenerations</p>
<p>There are beings who are cruel and evil.</p>
<p>They are blinded by desires and have foolish judgment</p>
<p>And they will never develop the aspiration to enlightenment. {141}</p>
<p>“In future times, beings will be confused,</p>
<p>And having heard this single yāna of mine</p>
<p>That has been taught by the Jina,</p>
<p>They will reject the discourse and go to hell. {142}</p>
<p>“To those beings who will be modest and pure</p>
<p>And are intent upon the supreme, highest enlightenment,</p>
<p>To them I will relate without any fear</p>
<p>Endless praises of the single yāna. {143}</p>
<p>“In this way, in the teaching of the guides,</p>
<p>This skill in methods, which is most excellent,</p>
<p>Has been taught many times in words with an implied meaning</p>
<p>That those who are untrained could not understand. {144}</p>
<p>“Therefore, understanding the implied meaning taught</p>
<p>By the buddhas, the teachers of the world, the protectors,</p>
<p>Rejecting doubts and abandoning uncertainty,</p>
<p>You will become buddhas, so be joyous!” {145}</p>
<p>This concludes “Skill in Methods,” the second chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Parable</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>Then at that time, Śāriputra felt contented, delighted, elated, and joyful. With happiness and gladness he bowed with palms together toward the Bhagavān. Facing the Bhagavān, gazing solely upon the Bhagavān, he said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I am astonished and amazed. I am overjoyed to have heard this kind of speech from the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Bhagavān, it is because I have never heard this kind of Dharma from the Bhagavān. When I saw other bodhisattvas and heard the names of the buddhas that those bodhisattvas will become in the future, and yet, still had not heard this kind of Dharma teaching from the Bhagavān, I imagined that I was deprived of that kind of vision of the tathāgatas’ wisdom, and was extremely grieved and extremely distressed.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, whenever I went to stay alone in mountains, caves, forests, groves, river banks, or the foot of trees, and many other places for my daytime rest, I thought, ‘Everyone enters the nature of the Dharma equally, but we are being liberated by the Bhagavān through the Hīnayāna.’</p>
<p>“At that time I thought, ‘The fault is ours, the fault is not the Bhagavān’s.’ Why is that? If we had stayed when the Bhagavān was teaching the excellent Dharma, commencing with the highest, complete enlightenment, then, Bhagavān, we also would have been liberated in that Dharma. Also, Bhagavān, when the bodhisattvas were not present, we did not understand the Bhagavān’s teaching that had an implied meaning. We immediately heard, retained, meditated on, contemplated, and focused upon the first Dharma teaching given by the Tathāgata. Bhagavān, I have reprimanded myself for that day and night.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, I have heard from the Bhagavān this marvelous Dharma that I have never heard before. Bhagavān, today I have attained nirvāṇa. Bhagavān, today I have become calmed. Bhagavān, today I have attained complete nirvāṇa. Bhagavān, today I have attained arhathood. Bhagavān, today I have become the Bhagavān’s principal son, born from his heart and mouth, born from the Dharma, emanated from the Dharma, descended from the Dharma, and created from the Dharma. Today I have become freed from sorrow.”</p>
<p>Then at that time Brother Śāriputra addressed these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“Great Guide, I am astonished.</p>
<p>I am content on hearing these words.</p>
<p>From now on, I will never have doubts.</p>
<p>I am ripened in this supreme yāna. {1}</p>
<p>“The teaching of the Sugata is marvelous.</p>
<p>It clears away the doubts and misery of beings.</p>
<p>My defilements have ceased and there is no misery.</p>
<p>Hearing your speech has dispelled everything. {2}</p>
<p>“Sitting and walking during the day</p>
<p>In forests, in groves, and under trees,</p>
<p>Dwelling in mountains and in caves</p>
<p>I contemplated with these thoughts: {3}</p>
<p>“ ‘Alas! I have been deceived by bad thoughts</p>
<p>Of the equal accessibility of the Dharma teachings, free of defilements.</p>
<p>I will not be teaching in future times</p>
<p>That which is the highest Dharma in the three realms. {4}</p>
<p>“ ‘Alas! I was deluded about the equal accessibility of the dharmas.</p>
<p>I am deprived of the thirty-two signs.</p>
<p>I am deprived of the shining color of gold.</p>
<p>I am devoid of all the strengths and the liberations. {5}</p>
<p>“ ‘Alas! I am deceived, and deprived also</p>
<p>Of the full eighty supreme,</p>
<p>Excellent features of a great muni,</p>
<p>And the unique eighteen qualities.’ {6}</p>
<p>“Having seen you who compassionately benefits the world,</p>
<p>I went to sit alone in the day’s time of rest.</p>
<p>I considered, ‘Alas! I have gone astray</p>
<p>From inconceivable, unobstructed wisdom!’ {7}</p>
<p>“Protector, in that way throughout day and night</p>
<p>I contemplated this over and over,</p>
<p>Thinking I shall ask the Bhagavān,</p>
<p>‘Have I strayed or have I not?’ {8}</p>
<p>“This is how I was thinking, Lord of Jinas,</p>
<p>All the time, throughout day and night.</p>
<p>I saw many other bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Being praised by the Guide of the World. {9}</p>
<p>“I heard this Dharma of the Buddha</p>
<p>That was taught with a hidden meaning.</p>
<p>The Jina taught at the Bodhimaṇḍa</p>
<p>An inconceivable, subtle, immaculate wisdom. {10}</p>
<p>“I was in the past attached to views.</p>
<p>I was an esteemed tīrthika mendicant.</p>
<p>Then the Lord, knowing my thoughts,</p>
<p>Taught me nirvāṇa to free me from those views. {11}</p>
<p>“After I was liberated from all those views</p>
<p>I realized the emptiness of phenomena.</p>
<p>Therefore I believed I had attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>But this was not what is called nirvāṇa. {12}</p>
<p>“When one becomes a buddha, the highest being,</p>
<p>Humans, maruts, yakṣas, and rākṣasas come before you,</p>
<p>And you possess a body with the thirty-two signs.</p>
<p>That is when there is the attainment of nirvāṇa without remainder. {13}</p>
<p>“I have dispelled all my pride,</p>
<p>Heard your words, and today I have attained nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>You prophesied my supreme enlightenment</p>
<p>In front of the world and its devas. {14}</p>
<p>“When I first heard the words of the Guide</p>
<p>I experienced a powerful terror</p>
<p>That this might be the wicked Māra</p>
<p>Manifesting on this earth in the appearance of a buddha. {15}</p>
<p>“When you taught through a quintillion</p>
<p>Causes, reasons, and parables, establishing</p>
<p>Buddhahood’s highest enlightenment,</p>
<p>Hearing that I had no doubt in the Dharma, {16}</p>
<p>“At that time you taught how ten billion jinas</p>
<p>Of the past who had passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Were established in skillful methods</p>
<p>And they also in that way taught the Dharma; {17}</p>
<p>“That many future buddhas who will be in the world,</p>
<p>And the present ones who have seen the ultimate truth,</p>
<p>Will be teaching and in that way are teaching</p>
<p>The Dharma through hundreds of skillful methods. {18}</p>
<p>“And you taught the nature of your own conduct,</p>
<p>Beginning with when you renounced your home,</p>
<p>And the way you realized the wheel of the Dharma,</p>
<p>And the way that you established the teaching of the Dharma. {19}</p>
<p>“And then I knew that you were not Māra,</p>
<p>But a lord of the world teaching correct conduct.</p>
<p>That is not found in the activity of the māras</p>
<p>And that had been the doubt in my mind. {20}</p>
<p>“When the gentle, profound, melodious</p>
<p>Speech of the Buddha filled me with joy,</p>
<p>All my uncertainties were dispelled</p>
<p>And in wisdom I remained free of doubt. {21}</p>
<p>“Without doubt I shall become a tathāgata</p>
<p>And the world and its devas will come before me.</p>
<p>Through words with an implied meaning, many bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Have been inspired toward the enlightenment of buddhahood.” {22}</p>
<p>In response to these words from Brother Śāriputra, the Bhagavān said to him, “Śāriputra, before the world and its devas, with its Māra and Brahmā, its mendicants and brahmins, I declare to you, and reveal to you, Śāriputra, in the presence of twenty hundred thousand quintillion buddhas, that I have ripened you for complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, you have been my follower for a long time. Śāriputra, it is through the bodhisattva instructions and the great secret of the bodhisattvas that you have appeared here within my teaching.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, you do not remember your past conduct, prayers, bodhisattva instructions, and great bodhisattva secret, formed through your firm bodhisattva resolve. You have thus thought, ‘I have attained nirvāṇa.’</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, I wish to make you remember and understand your past conduct, prayers, and wisdom. So I will teach to the śrāvakas this great, extensive sūtra, the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, which is an instruction for bodhisattvas, and is possessed by all the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, in this way in the future, during countless, innumerable, incalculable eons, you will be the holder of the Dharma of many hundred thousand quintillions of tathāgatas, make all kinds of offerings to them, and perfectly complete these practices of the bodhisattva, and then you will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Padmaprabha.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, at that time, the bhagavān tathāgata Padmaprabha will have a realm named Virajā, which will be level, delightful, good, beautiful, pure, prosperous, wealthy, peaceful, with an abundance of food, and filled with many humans and maruts. The ground will be beryl, divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords, and within each square there will be jewel trees, which will always be adorned by flowers and fruits made of the seven precious materials.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Padmaprabha will teach the Dharma beginning with the three yānas. Moreover, Śāriputra, although that tathāgata will not appear during an eon of degeneration, he will nevertheless teach the Dharma in accordance with his previous prayers.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the name of that eon will be Adorned by Great Jewels. Śāriputra, why do you think that eon will be called Adorned by Great Jewels? Śāriputra, in that realm the bodhisattvas will be called great jewels (mahāratna), and at that time, in that era, in the realm Virajā there will appear so many bodhisattvas that they will be countless, incalculable, innumerable; only a tathāgata will be able to count them. That is why that eon will be called Adorned by Great Jewels.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, at that time the bodhisattvas in that buddha realm will be stepping upon jewel lotuses when they walk. Those bodhisattvas will not be novices, but will have practiced the roots of merit for a long time, practiced celibacy with many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, been praised by the tathāgatas, been dedicated to the wisdom of buddhahood, given rise to the development of the great higher knowledges, become skilled in all the ways of the Dharma, and will be kind and mindful.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, that buddha realm will be filled by that kind of bodhisattva.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the lifespan of Tathāgata Padmaprabha will be twelve intermediate eons, not counting his youth. The lifespan of the beings there will be eight intermediate eons.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, when those twelve intermediate eons have passed, Tathāgata Padmaprabha will say, ‘Bhikṣus, this bodhisattva mahāsattva named Dhṛtiparipūrṇa will be next to attain the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood and will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Padma­vṛṣabha­vikrāmin.’ After he gives to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dhṛtiparipūrṇa the prophecy of his highest, complete enlightenment, he will then pass into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the buddha realm of Tathāgata Padma­vṛṣabha­vikrāmin will have the same appearance as that of Padmaprabha.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, after Tathāgata Padmaprabha passes into nirvāṇa the Dharma will remain for thirty-two intermediate eons, and then the outer form of the Dharma will remain for another thirty-two intermediate eons.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“In a future time you, Śārisuta,</p>
<p>Will become a jina, a tathāgata,</p>
<p>The all-seeing Padmaprabha,</p>
<p>Who will guide ten billion beings. {23}</p>
<p>“You will honor many millions of buddhas,</p>
<p>You will accomplish powerful conduct,</p>
<p>You will develop the ten strengths,</p>
<p>And you will reach the supreme, highest enlightenment. {24}</p>
<p>“After countless, incalculable eons</p>
<p>There will be the eon Many Jewels.</p>
<p>There will be a world named Virajā</p>
<p>That will be the pure realm of that supreme human. {25}</p>
<p>“The ground will be covered with beryl</p>
<p>And it will be adorned by cords of gold.</p>
<p>Present there will be hundreds of trees made of jewels</p>
<p>That are beautiful and adorned by flowers and fruits. {26}</p>
<p>“There will be many mindful bodhisattvas there</p>
<p>Who are skilled in the accomplishment of perfect conduct.</p>
<p>Those who will be born into that realm</p>
<p>Will have trained in conduct with hundreds of buddhas. {27}</p>
<p>“That jina in his final lifetime,</p>
<p>When he has passed beyond the time of his youth,</p>
<p>Will forsake desires, leave the worldly life,</p>
<p>And will attain the highest, complete enlightenment. {28}</p>
<p>“The lifespan of that jina</p>
<p>Will be the same as twelve intermediate eons.</p>
<p>The lifespan of humans in that world</p>
<p>Will be eight intermediate eons. {29}</p>
<p>“When that jina has passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>The Dharma will remain during the time</p>
<p>Of thirty-two intermediate eons in their entirety</p>
<p>In order to benefit the world and its devas. {30}</p>
<p>“The Dharma will cease but its outer form</p>
<p>Will remain for a futher thirty-two intermediate eons.</p>
<p>The relics of that protector’s body will multiply</p>
<p>And the humans and maruts will continually honor them. {31}</p>
<p>“That you will thus become a bhagavān,</p>
<p>Śārisuta, you should be delighted.</p>
<p>That is what you will become:</p>
<p>An unsurpassable supreme human.” {32}</p>
<p>Then the fourfold assembly of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās, as well as devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, having heard directly from the Bhagavān this prophecy of Brother Śāriputra’s highest, complete enlightenment, were contented, delighted, elated, and joyful. With happiness and gladness they presented the Bhagavān’s body with their own clothing. Śakra, the lord of devas, and Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, and another trillion devas also presented the Bhagavān’s body with divine clothing. They scattered divine coral tree and great coral tree flowers. They waved divine cloths in the sky above him. They played a hundred thousand divine musical instruments and beat drums in the sky. A great rain of flowers fell and they proclaimed, “The Bhagavān previously turned the wheel of Dharma in the Ṛṣipatana deer forest in the land of Vārāṇasī, and on this day the Bhagavān has turned the highest Dharma wheel.”</p>
<p>At that time those devas recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Unequaled individual, great hero,</p>
<p>In the land of Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>You turned the Dharma wheel</p>
<p>Of the arising and cessation of the skandhas. {33}</p>
<p>“There took place the first turning</p>
<p>And here, Guide, this is the second.</p>
<p>You have taught today, Leader,</p>
<p>That which is difficult to believe. {34}</p>
<p>“We have heard many dharmas</p>
<p>In the presence of the world’s lord,</p>
<p>But we have never before</p>
<p>Heard a dharma of this kind. {35}</p>
<p>“Great hero, we are overjoyed by</p>
<p>The great rishi’s words with implied meaning.</p>
<p>Just as in the prophecy</p>
<p>To the fearless Ārya Śāriputra, {36}</p>
<p>“May we also in that way become</p>
<p>Unsurpassable buddhas in the world,</p>
<p>And through words with implied meaning</p>
<p>Teach buddhahood’s highest enlightenment. {37}</p>
<p>“Whatever good we do</p>
<p>In this or in other worlds,</p>
<p>And through pleasing the Buddha,</p>
<p>May we aspire for enlightenment.” {38}</p>
<p>Then Brother Śāriputra said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I have directly heard from the Bhagavān the prophecy of my attaining the highest, complete enlightenment. Bhagavān, I have no doubt. I am free of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, these one thousand two hundred who have gained self-control were previously established as students by the Bhagavān, and were instructed thus, were taught thus: ‘Bhikṣus, the ultimate conclusion of the discipline of the Dharma is the transcendence of birth, aging, sickness, and death, the goal of nirvāṇa, being absorbed in nirvāṇa.’ Bhagavān, these bhikṣus, both those training and trained, have renounced the view of self, the view of production, the view of destruction, and all views. All of these two thousand śrāvakas of the Bhagavān think, ‘I reside on the level of nirvāṇa.’</p>
<p>“Having heard from the Bhagavān this kind of Dharma, which they have never heard before, they are puzzled. Bhagavān, so that the fourfold assembly will be without doubt, and without uncertainty, and so that these bhikṣus will have their worries dispelled, I beseech the Bhagavān to teach them well.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to Brother Śāriputra, “Śāriputra, knowing the different aspirations and different thoughts and natures of beings, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha teaches the Dharma through various accomplishments, causes, reasons, parables, supports, definitions, and skillful methods in this way. Commencing with the highest, complete enlightenment, through all the teaching of the Dharma he inspires them to enter into this very Bodhisattva­yāna. Have I not already taught you this earlier?</p>
<p>“However, Śāriputra, in order to teach that meaning extensively I shall teach you parables. Why is that? Some wise individuals will understand through parables the meaning of what has been said.</p>
<p>“As a parable, Śāriputra, in a village, a town, a market town, a district, a region, a country, or a capital, there was a householder who was old, an elder, advanced in years, aged, and was rich, wealthy, and had many possessions. His home was tall and extensive. It had been built a long time ago and had deteriorated. A hundred, two hundred, three, four, or five hundred people lived in it. It had only one entranceway. It was roofed with hay. Its terrace was crumbling. The bases of its pillars were rotten. The walls and doors were disintegrating. A great fire started suddenly throughout the house from all sides. The man had many sons—five, ten, or twenty—and the man came out from the house. Śāriputra, the man then saw the great fire burning everywhere throughout his house. He was frightened and dismayed. He thought, ‘I have not been touched, I have not been burned by this great fire. I was able to quickly escape from the burning house through the door. But my sons, who are young, who are children, are engaged in enjoying themselves playing games inside the burning house. They are not aware that the house is burning, they have not understood it, do not know it, have not realized it, and so they will be burned in this great fire, and will experience great suffering. But they are not dismayed at the thought of being touched by that great fire, they do not think of that suffering, and do not think of escaping from the house.’</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the man was very strong and had very strong arms. He thought, ‘I am strong and I have strong arms. I shall gather all the children together and carry them on my hips out from the house.’ Then he thought, ‘The house has only one door and that door is narrow. These young ones don’t stay still, are always running around, so I won’t be able to bring them out, and there will be the disaster of their agony in the great fire. So I should call out to them.’</p>
<p>“Then he called out to the children, ‘There is a massive fire burning the house! Everything inside is going to be burned in this great fire! You will suffer disastrously! Children, come here! Come out!’</p>
<p>“The man gave that command wishing to help them, but the children, not knowing what ‘burning’ meant were not dismayed, not frightened, and not terrified. They did not think about it and did not come out, but ran and scampered around here and there, repeatedly looking out at their father. Why was that? They were like that because they were children.</p>
<p>“Then the man thought, ‘A great fire is burning this house. My children and I are going to be afflicted disastrously by this great fire. But if I use a skillful method I will be able to bring the children out of the house.’</p>
<p>“The man knew what his children thought. He understood that they would wish for many different kinds of amusements, and many different kinds of things: a variety of delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, and charming and pleasant things, which would be difficult to find.</p>
<p>“Then the man, knowing their thoughts, called to the children, ‘Those toys that you delight in and marvel at, and that you are unhappy not to have obtained, which have many different colors and shapes, such as an ox-drawn cart, a goat-drawn cart, and a deer-drawn cart, which you think are delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, charming, and pleasant, those I have placed outside at the entrance door of the house outside so that you can play with them. So come, run outside, and I will give each of you whatever you want. So come quickly for that reason!’</p>
<p>“Those children, hearing that and the names of those things that they wished for, that they longed for, which they thought delightful, desirable, pleasing, beautiful, charming, and pleasant, in order to play with those things, quickly and zealously ran out from the burning house with great speed, calling out to each other, ‘Who will be first? Who will be first of all?’ And as one body they quickly came running out of the burning house.</p>
<p>“Then the man saw that they had come out safe and well, and were no longer in danger. Then they came to the village square, in the open air. He was delighted and joyful. He was free of sorrow, untroubled and unafraid.</p>
<p>“Then the children went to their father and said, ‘Father, give to us the various kinds of toys for playing with, such as an ox-drawn cart, a goat-drawn cart, and a deer-drawn cart.’</p>
<p>“Then, Śāriputra, the man gave all his sons carts drawn by powerful oxen that were as fast as the wind. The carts were made of the seven precious materials. They had seats. They had strings of small bells attached. They were high and stable. They were adorned with marvelous, amazing jewels. They were beautified by strings of jewels. They were decorated with flower garlands. They had cotton-filled cushions covered with calico and silk, and red backrests on both sides. Yoked to them were dazzling white oxen that were swift and that were held by many men. They had banners. He gave to each of his children an ox-drawn cart that was as fast as the wind.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, what was the reason for that? The man was rich, wealthy, and had many treasuries. He thought, ‘There is no reason why I should give inferior carts to my children. Why is that? All these children are my sons. All of them are dear and precious to me. If I have such great carts, I should treat them all equally, and not unequally. I have many treasuries, so not to speak of my own sons alone, I should give all beings this kind of great cart.’ Then at that time those children, astonished and amazed, climbed onto those great carts.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, what do you think? In that way, the man first promised three carts to those children, but afterward gave them all such great carts, magnificent carts. Does that mean that the man would be a liar?”</p>
<p>“No, Bhagavān, he would not be,” answered Śāriputra. “Sugata, it is not like that. The man through employing that skillful method brought those children out from the burning house in order to save their lives. That would not be a reason for his being a liar. Why is that? Bhagavān, it was only through saving their own bodies that they could obtain all those toys, and, Bhagavān, the man did not give just one cart to his children. Therefore, Bhagavān, the man was not a liar. Why is that? Bhagavān, first the man thought, ‘Using a skillful method I shall save the children from immense suffering.’ Because of that approach, the man would not be a liar. That man had many treasuries and he thought of his children with affection, and wished to delight them. Not to speak of just giving them a great cart, he gave each one a cart with the same colors. Therefore, Bhagavān, the man would not be a liar.”</p>
<p>When he had said that, the Bhagavān commended Śāriputra, “Excellent, excellent, Śāriputra! It is so, Śāriputra! It is exactly as you have said! In that same way a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha saves from all dangers, all violence, troubles, harm, suffering, unhappiness, the darkness of ignorance, the obscuration of the dark of blindness, and being in bondage.</p>
<p>“A tathāgata has wisdom, strengths, fearlessnesses, and the unique qualities of a buddha. He has great power through miraculous powers. He is a father to the world. He has reached the perfection of the supreme wisdom of skill in great methods. He has great compassion. He has an untiring mind. He wishes to benefit. He is compassionate. He appears in the three realms that are like a house with a ruined upper story and roof burning with a great mass of suffering, and he liberates from desire, anger, and ignorance those beings who undergo birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, the darkness of ignorance, the obscuration of the dark of blindness, and being in bondage, in order to bring them to the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“As soon as he appears he sees the beings who are being burned, roasted, pained, and tormented by birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing, suffering, and unhappiness. For the sake of pleasures, with their desire as the cause and basis, they experience many forms of suffering. In this lifetime their grasping is the basis for experiencing in their next life many kinds of sufferings in the hells, as animals, and in the realm of Yama.</p>
<p>“The devas and humans experience the suffering of being poor, encountering what is unpleasant, and being separated from what is pleasant. While circling within a great mass of suffering, they take pleasure in amusements, are not afraid, are not terrified, and cannot be made to be terrified; they do not understand, are not aware, are not troubled, and do not wish to leave.</p>
<p>“They amuse themselves in the three realms, which are like a burning house, running back and forth. Even though they are afflicted by that great mass of suffering, they do not see it or identify it as suffering.</p>
<p>“This, Śāriputra, is how a tathāgata sees: I am the father of these beings. I will liberate these beings from this mass of suffering. I shall give to these beings the inconceivable, incalculable bliss of the wisdom of buddhahood, which they will delight in, enjoy, take pleasure in, and amuse themselves with.</p>
<p>“This, Śāriputra, is how a tathāgata sees: it is said I have the strength of wisdom, the strength of miraculous powers, but if I had no method and instructed these beings to attain a tathāgata’s wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses, those beings would not become liberated through those dharmas. Why is that? Those beings are attached to the five sensory pleasures, and delight in the three realms. They would not become liberated from birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, and disturbance. They would not escape from the three realms, which are like a house with a dilapidated roof and rafters that are on fire, and in which they will be burned, roasted, pained, and tormented. So how could they enjoy the wisdom of buddhahood?</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the man with strong arms did not use the strength of his arms but used a skillful method to bring his children out from the burning house, and afterward gave them magnificent great carts. In the same way, Śāriputra, a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha has the wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses of a tathāgata, but instead of using the tathāgata’s wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses, through the wisdom of skill in methods he teaches three yānas in order to free beings from the three realms, which are like a dilapidated house with its roof and rafters on fire. He guides beings through the three yānas, which are the Śrāvakayāna, the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, and the Bodhisattva­yāna.</p>
<p>“He says to them, ‘Do not take pleasure in the forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and physical sensations of the three realms, which are like a house on fire. Through taking pleasure in these three realms and through craving for the five sensory pleasures, you will be burned, roasted, pained, and tormented. This is how one escapes from the three realms: obtain the three yānas—the Śrāvakayāna, Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, and Bodhisattva­yāna. This I promise you. I shall give you these three yānas. Dedicate yourself to them in order to escape from the three realms. Beings! These yānas are those of the āryas, they are praised by the āryas, and they bring great joy. Perfectly amuse yourself with them, enjoy them, and delight in them. Experience great joy through the powers, the strengths, the aspects of enlightenment, the dhyānas, the liberations, the samādhis, and the samāpattis. You will become possessed of perfect happiness of mind.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, those beings who are wise will believe in the Tathāgata, the father of the world. Having that belief they will be dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata. Some beings long to follow the way of listening to what is spoken. They are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to realize the four truths of the āryas as the cause of attaining nirvāṇa for themselves. They are called those who long for the Śrāvakayāna and they escape from the three realms. They are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for a deer-drawn cart.</p>
<p>“There are others who long for wisdom, self-control, and tranquility without having a teacher. They are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to realize causes and conditions as the cause of attaining nirvāṇa for themselves. They are called those who long for the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna and they escape from the three realms. They are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for a goat-drawn cart.</p>
<p>“Some beings long for omniscient buddhahood, for the wisdom of buddhahood, for self-arising wisdom, for wisdom without a teacher. They are dedicated to the teachings of the Tathāgata in order to benefit many beings, for the happiness of many beings, and—through great compassion for the world—for the sake of, the benefit of, and the happiness of devas, humans, and ordinary beings, as the cause for all beings attaining nirvāṇa, and in order to realize the wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses of a tathāgata. They are called those who long for the Mahāyāna and they escape from the three realms. That is why they are called bodhisattva mahāsattvas. They are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for an ox-drawn cart.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, in the parable the man sees that he has brought the children out from the burning house, and that they are happy, fortunate, and saved. He knows that he is very wealthy, and so he gives each of the children an identical magnificent cart.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, in that way the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha sees many millions of beings liberated from the three realms, which are filled with danger, fear, terror, and calamity. These beings come out through the doorway of the tathāgatas’ teachings, and are freed from danger, fear, terror, and calamity and attain the bliss of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, at the time when he becomes a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha, he knows that he possesses many treasuries of wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses, he sees all beings as his children, and therefore brings all of them to complete nirvāṇa through the Buddhayāna. He does not teach any being to attain nirvāṇa for themselves. He brings all those beings to nirvāṇa through the great nirvāṇa, the tathāgatas’ nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, the Tathāgata gives to those beings that are liberated from the three realms the enjoyable, delightful dhyānas, liberations, samādhis, samāpattis, and the supreme bliss of the āryas. All of these are of the same kind.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, it is like the man who promised three kinds of carts to his children and then gave each of them an identical great cart. He gave them all carts that were better than any other, that were made of the seven precious materials, adorned by all adornments, of the same color, and magnificent. Therefore he was not a liar.</p>
<p>“In the same way, Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, with this skill in methods, first teaches three yānas, and afterward brings beings to nirvāṇa through a single yāna. Therefore he is not a liar. Why is that? Śāriputra, the Tathāgata possesses many treasuries of wisdom, strengths, and fearlessnesses and he has the power to teach all beings the Dharma of omniscient wisdom.</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, it should be known that it is through this teaching, through the accomplishment of the wisdom of various skillful methods, that the Tathāgata teaches the single Mahāyāna.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān at that time recited these verses:</p>
<p>“A man possesses a house</p>
<p>That is large, decaying, and dilapidated,</p>
<p>Its terrace crumbling,</p>
<p>The bases of its pillars rotten, {39}</p>
<p>And the windows and pavilions bent out of shape.</p>
<p>The reeds and plaster of the walls are falling apart,</p>
<p>The old, decayed balconies have collapsed,</p>
<p>And the straw roof is disintegrating and falling. {40}</p>
<p>“No fewer than five hundred beings</p>
<p>Are living inside</p>
<p>In numerous narrow rooms,</p>
<p>Filled with excrement, and disgusting. {41}</p>
<p>“The rafters have all fallen apart,</p>
<p>The walls’ reeds and panels have fallen apart,</p>
<p>And ten million vultures live inside,</p>
<p>And similarly pigeons and owls. {42}</p>
<p>“There are vicious poisonous snakes</p>
<p>With virulent great poison everywhere.</p>
<p>Various kinds of scorpions and rats</p>
<p>And malevolent creatures live in there. {43}</p>
<p>“There are many nonhumans everywhere</p>
<p>And it is fouled by feces and urine.</p>
<p>There are venomous insects, fireflies, and ants,</p>
<p>And dogs and jackals are howling. {44}</p>
<p>“Dreadful hyenas are there</p>
<p>Devouring human corpses.</p>
<p>Many dogs and jackals are also there,</p>
<p>Coming out and staring at them. {45}</p>
<p>“They are always weak and hungry,</p>
<p>Devouring here and there.</p>
<p>They are fighting and yowling.</p>
<p>That is the kind of terrifying house it is. {46}</p>
<p>“Extremely ferocious yakṣas live there</p>
<p>Who are gnawing on human corpses.</p>
<p>Everywhere in every place there live</p>
<p>Centipedes, snakes, and vicious creatures. {47}</p>
<p>“They make their nests everywhere</p>
<p>As dwellings for their offspring.</p>
<p>The numerous yakṣas devour</p>
<p>Those that are placed here and there. {48}</p>
<p>“When the yakṣas are engorged,</p>
<p>Having ferociously eaten other beings,</p>
<p>Their bodies nourished by the flesh of other beings,</p>
<p>They begin to fight violently. {49}</p>
<p>“Dreadful, ferocious kumbhāṇḍas</p>
<p>Live there in that ruined abode,</p>
<p>Some a hand-span tall, some a cubit,</p>
<p>And some two cubits, wandering around. {50}</p>
<p>“They seize the legs of dogs</p>
<p>And hold them, backs to the ground,</p>
<p>And squeeze their throats, menacing them</p>
<p>And delighting in injuring them. {51}</p>
<p>“There are black, naked, thin,</p>
<p>Great pretas that have lived there long,</p>
<p>Extremely hungry, searching for food,</p>
<p>Here and there crying in pain and weeping. {52}</p>
<p>“Some have a needle-sized mouth and some an ox’s head.</p>
<p>Some are the size of humans and some the size of dogs.</p>
<p>Their hair is in disarray and they wail,</p>
<p>Tormented by their craving for food. {53}</p>
<p>“The yakṣas, piśācas, and pretas</p>
<p>Are brutes searching for food,</p>
<p>Looking in all four directions,</p>
<p>Always looking in through windows. {54}</p>
<p>“The house is terrifying in that way.</p>
<p>It is huge, tall, and very weakened,</p>
<p>Dilapidated and almost a ruin,</p>
<p>And it is owned by a single person. {55}</p>
<p>“That man has come out of his house</p>
<p>When the dwelling catches on fire,</p>
<p>Suddenly everywhere in all four directions,</p>
<p>With thousands of flames rising up. {56}</p>
<p>“The bamboo and wood are burned by fire</p>
<p>And they make a terrifying, powerful sound.</p>
<p>The pillars and the wall panels are also burning</p>
<p>And the yakṣas and pretas are emitting cries. {57}</p>
<p>“The many hundreds of vultures are burned,</p>
<p>The kumbhāṇḍas run around with burned faces,</p>
<p>And the many hundreds of snakes that are there</p>
<p>Scream and wail as they are being burned. {58}</p>
<p>“The numerous piśācas are running around</p>
<p>And those without merit are burned by the fire.</p>
<p>Their teeth bite into each other</p>
<p>And they scatter their blood as they are being burned. {59}</p>
<p>“The hyenas, their time to die having come,</p>
<p>Are eating beings and eating each other.</p>
<p>The awful smell of burning vomit</p>
<p>Spreads through the four directions of the world. {60}</p>
<p>“The kumbhāṇḍas are eating</p>
<p>The fleeing centipedes.</p>
<p>The pretas run around with burning hair,</p>
<p>Tormented by hunger and thirst. {61}</p>
<p>“That kind of terrifying residence</p>
<p>Is being burned by thousands of flames.</p>
<p>The man who is the owner of that house</p>
<p>Is gazing upon it, standing at the door. {62}</p>
<p>He hears his sons who are inside,</p>
<p>Their minds fixed upon their games.</p>
<p>The children continue to be unaware</p>
<p>As they play, intoxicated by their games. {63}</p>
<p>“Hearing them he quickly enters</p>
<p>In order to rescue his sons, thinking,</p>
<p>‘I shall not let my children, all these boys,</p>
<p>Be quickly burned and annihilated.’ {64}</p>
<p>“He tells them of the evils of the house:</p>
<p>‘Oh noble sons, this suffering is terrible.</p>
<p>Many kinds of beings are experiencing in this fire</p>
<p>Great sufferings, one after the other. {65}</p>
<p>“ ‘Many ferocious yakṣas, venomous snakes,</p>
<p>Kumbhāṇḍas, and pretas are living here.</p>
<p>Packs of hyenas, dogs, and jackals,</p>
<p>And also vultures are here seeking food. {66}</p>
<p>“ ‘There are many like that living in here.</p>
<p>Even without fire, it would be completely terrifying.</p>
<p>There is nothing here but this kind of suffering</p>
<p>And all around us a fire is burning.’ {67}</p>
<p>“He thus encourages those with child’s minds to leave.</p>
<p>But the children are intoxicated by their games.</p>
<p>They do not think about what their father has said</p>
<p>And neither do they pay it any attention. {68}</p>
<p>“Then at that time the man thinks,</p>
<p>‘I am suffering in thinking of my sons,</p>
<p>I shall not allow this fire to burn them</p>
<p>So that I am without sons and lineage.’ {69}</p>
<p>“Then at that time he thinks of a method:</p>
<p>‘These children have a great longing for toys,</p>
<p>But they do not have any toys in there to enjoy.</p>
<p>Such is the foolishness of these children. {70}</p>
<p>“He calls to them, ‘Listen, children!</p>
<p>I have three different kinds of carts,</p>
<p>To which are yoked excellent goats, oxen, or deer,</p>
<p>And which are large, tall, and perfectly adorned. {71}</p>
<p>“ ‘They are outside the house.</p>
<p>Run outside and use them!</p>
<p>I have had them made for you.</p>
<p>Go out and you will be delighted!’ {72}</p>
<p>“The children, hearing of these kinds of carts,</p>
<p>Become eager and make haste.</p>
<p>And at that very moment they all run out</p>
<p>And stand in the open air, freed from suffering. {73}</p>
<p>“When the man sees his children have come out</p>
<p>He goes to the square in the center of town.</p>
<p>There he sits on a lion throne and says to them,</p>
<p>‘Oh, today I have been made perfectly happy. {74}</p>
<p>“ ‘I have saved with difficulty these who were in distress.</p>
<p>My beloved sons, these twenty children of mine,</p>
<p>They were in a dreadful, awful house</p>
<p>That was filled with many terrifying beings. {75}</p>
<p>“ ‘It was burning, filled with a thousand flames,</p>
<p>And they were delighting in their games.</p>
<p>I have today saved them all</p>
<p>And therefore today I am perfectly happy.’ {76}</p>
<p>“Seeing their father sitting happily</p>
<p>The children come to him and say,</p>
<p>‘Give us that which you have described—</p>
<p>Those three delightful carts! {77}</p>
<p>“ ‘You said to us in the house,</p>
<p>“I will give you three kinds of carts.”</p>
<p>Even if you do not have all these</p>
<p>The time has now come for you to give them.’ {78}</p>
<p>“That man has the power of treasuries</p>
<p>Of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls,</p>
<p>And a great deal of money and slaves.</p>
<p>And he has identical carts made for them. {79}</p>
<p>“They are excellent ox-drawn carts made of jewels,</p>
<p>With railings and strings of little bells,</p>
<p>Adorned with parasols and banners,</p>
<p>And covered with a network of pearls and jewels. {80}</p>
<p>“They are hung all over, here and there,</p>
<p>With garlands made of golden flowers.</p>
<p>They are covered with excellent cloth</p>
<p>And spread over with the best white calico. {81}</p>
<p>“Those carts are spread with the best cotton</p>
<p>And likewise with the softest silks.</p>
<p>They are covered with excellent rugs</p>
<p>Decorated with geese, that are worth billions. {82}</p>
<p>“White, well-fed, strong oxen,</p>
<p>Of great size and beauty,</p>
<p>Are yoked to those precious carts</p>
<p>And are held by many people. {83}</p>
<p>“This kind of excellent, superior cart</p>
<p>Is what the man gives to all his children,</p>
<p>And they feel delight and joy,</p>
<p>And amuse themselves going in every direction. {84}</p>
<p>“In that way, Śārisuta, I am a great rishi.</p>
<p>I am the protector and the father of beings.</p>
<p>All of these beings are my sons,</p>
<p>Children attached to pleasures in the three realms. {85}</p>
<p>“The three realms are like that house</p>
<p>Dreadful and filled with suffering.</p>
<p>It is entirely burning everywhere</p>
<p>With hundreds of births, old age, and illness. {86}</p>
<p>“I am liberated from the three realms and at peace.</p>
<p>I reside in the forests and remain in solitude.</p>
<p>These three realms are my possession</p>
<p>And those who are burning within it are my sons. {87}</p>
<p>“Knowing that I am their protector,</p>
<p>I teach them of the distress that is in there.</p>
<p>All these children, they do not listen to me,</p>
<p>Because their minds are fixated upon pleasures. {88}</p>
<p>“I employ skillful methods</p>
<p>And teach them three yānas.</p>
<p>I teach them a method so that by knowing the many evils</p>
<p>In the three realms they may escape from them. {89}</p>
<p>“Those sons who have relied upon me have gained</p>
<p>Great power, the six higher knowledges, and the three insights,</p>
<p>And have become the pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>And irreversible bodhisattvas who are here. {90}</p>
<p>“To those who are like my sons, at this time</p>
<p>I teach this single Buddhayāna, O wise ones,</p>
<p>Through the best of parables.</p>
<p>Follow it, and you will all become jinas. {91}</p>
<p>“The wisdom of the buddhas, the supreme humans,</p>
<p>Is superior and beautiful,</p>
<p>Unique in all these worlds,</p>
<p>And a magnificent form that is worthy of homage. {92}</p>
<p>“The strengths, the dhyānas, and likewise the liberations,</p>
<p>And numerous millions of samādhis,</p>
<p>They are the most excellent cart,</p>
<p>Which the Buddha’s sons continually enjoy. {93}</p>
<p>“They spend nights enjoying it,</p>
<p>And days, half-months, and months,</p>
<p>And likewise years and intermediate eons.</p>
<p>They spend ten billion eons doing so. {94}</p>
<p>“It is this excellent cart made of jewels</p>
<p>That goes from here to the Bodhimaṇḍa,</p>
<p>Which the Sugata’s śrāvakas listen to</p>
<p>And which many bodhisattvas enjoy. {95}</p>
<p>“Tiṣya, you should know this today:</p>
<p>You may search in all ten directions,</p>
<p>But there is no second yāna whatsoever</p>
<p>Other than as a skillful method of the superior beings. {96}</p>
<p>“I am your father and you are my sons.</p>
<p>I have saved you from the suffering</p>
<p>Of being burned for many millions of eons</p>
<p>Within the terrifying three realms. {97}</p>
<p>“I have thus taught you nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>You are freed from the suffering of saṃsāra,</p>
<p>But you have still not attained nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>You need to seek the yāna of buddhahood. {98}</p>
<p>“You bodhisattvas who are gathered here,</p>
<p>Listen to my way to buddhahood.</p>
<p>Through this many bodhisattvas are trained.</p>
<p>This is the skillful method of the jinas. {99}</p>
<p>“When beings take delight</p>
<p>In the lower, inferior yāna,</p>
<p>At that time the Guide of the World teaches nothing</p>
<p>Other than the ārya’s truth of suffering. {100}</p>
<p>“There are those with foolish minds</p>
<p>Who, being ignorant, do not see the source of suffering.</p>
<p>To them I teach the path that craving</p>
<p>Is the origin of the arising of suffering. {101}</p>
<p>“The cessation of craving is perpetual nonattachment.</p>
<p>This truth of cessation is my third truth.</p>
<p>Humans are liberated by that and by nothing else;</p>
<p>It is through meditation on the path that they are liberated. {102}</p>
<p>“From what, Śārisuta, are they liberated?</p>
<p>They are liberated from fixation on the unreal,</p>
<p>But they are still not liberated from everything.</p>
<p>The guides state that they have not attained nirvāṇa. {103}</p>
<p>“Why do I say that this is not liberation?</p>
<p>Because this supreme, highest enlightenment is not attained.</p>
<p>I was born in this world in order to bring happiness.</p>
<p>That is the wish that I, the King of Dharma, have. {104}</p>
<p>“This, Śāriputra, is my Dharma seal</p>
<p>That I teach today, at this later time.</p>
<p>You should teach this in every direction</p>
<p>In order to benefit the world and its devas. {105}</p>
<p>“If, when you teach it, there are beings</p>
<p>Who say the words ‘This makes me rejoice’</p>
<p>And place this sūtra upon their head,</p>
<p>You should hold such people to be irreversible. {106}</p>
<p>“The ones who have faith in this sūtra</p>
<p>Have seen the tathāgatas of the past.</p>
<p>And they are those who have honored them</p>
<p>And heard from them this kind of Dharma. {107}</p>
<p>“The ones who have faith in this teaching of mine</p>
<p>Have seen me and have seen you,</p>
<p>Have seen this entire bhikṣu saṅgha of mine</p>
<p>And have seen all of these bodhisattvas. {108}</p>
<p>“I have taught with great higher knowledge</p>
<p>This sūtra, which would bewilder foolish beings.</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of the śrāvakas,</p>
<p>And is not in the course of the pratyeka­buddhas. {109}</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, if you have no aspiration for this,</p>
<p>What could be said for the other śrāvakas of mine?</p>
<p>These follow because they have faith in me,</p>
<p>Without having knowledge through their own wisdom. {110}</p>
<p>“You should not teach this to those who are proud,</p>
<p>Who are arrogant, and who are unsuitable.</p>
<p>The foolish are constantly intoxicated by desires.</p>
<p>Ignorant, they will reject the Dharma that is taught. {111}</p>
<p>“They will reject this skillful method of mine,</p>
<p>This way of the buddhas that is always in the world.</p>
<p>They will frown and then reject this yāna.</p>
<p>Listen to what is the dreadful ripening of their karma. {112}</p>
<p>“Whether I am present or have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>When they have rejected a sūtra such as this</p>
<p>Or speak harshly to the bhikṣus,</p>
<p>This is the result that ripens for them; listen to me! {113}</p>
<p>“When they die and depart from the human world</p>
<p>They will remain in Avīci for an entire eon.</p>
<p>And then for many intermediate eons</p>
<p>Those fools will die and fall into that place. {114}</p>
<p>“When they die and depart from the hells</p>
<p>Then they will be reborn as animals.</p>
<p>They will become weak dogs and jackals,</p>
<p>And become playthings for others. {115}</p>
<p>“Having contempt for my supreme enlightenment,</p>
<p>They will be black in color,</p>
<p>Have spots, sores, and itching,</p>
<p>Lose their body hair, and be very weak. {116}</p>
<p>“They will always be abhorred among beings;</p>
<p>They will howl as they are hit by clods and stones.</p>
<p>Here and there they will be terrified by sticks;</p>
<p>Hungry and thirsty, they will be emaciated. {117}</p>
<p>“Those with foolish minds who reject the way of the Buddha</p>
<p>Will become camels or donkeys</p>
<p>Who only think thoughts about food,</p>
<p>Carry loads, and are beaten by sticks and whips. {118}</p>
<p>“Those fools will then become jackals,</p>
<p>Loathsome, one-eyed, and maimed,</p>
<p>Tormented by the village children</p>
<p>Who throw stones and clods at them. {119}</p>
<p>“Then when those with foolish minds pass away</p>
<p>They will become creatures of great length,</p>
<p>Measuring five hundred yojanas,</p>
<p>And they will be stupid and dull, rolling back and forth. {120}</p>
<p>“Having rejected this kind of sūtra</p>
<p>They will be legless, moving on their stomachs.</p>
<p>They will be eaten by many millions of creatures</p>
<p>And will experience extremely dreadful sensations. {121}</p>
<p>“They who have no faith in my sūtra,</p>
<p>Whenever they obtain a human existence,</p>
<p>They will be maimed and crippled,</p>
<p>Humpbacked, one-eyed, stupid, and inferior. {122}</p>
<p>“Those who have no faith in this enlightenment of the buddhas</p>
<p>Will encounter antipathy in this world.</p>
<p>A rotten smell will come from their mouths</p>
<p>And they will be possessed by yakṣas that enter their bodies. {123}</p>
<p>“They will be poor, menial workers.</p>
<p>They will always be powerless servants of others.</p>
<p>They will have many illnesses and harms</p>
<p>And will live in the world without any protector. {124}</p>
<p>“The one that they serve</p>
<p>Will not wish to pay them.</p>
<p>Even if paid, it will soon be lost.</p>
<p>Such will be the result of their bad karma. {125}</p>
<p>“Any medicine that they obtain,</p>
<p>Even if given by an expert in its preparation,</p>
<p>Will only cause their illness to increase</p>
<p>And they will never be free of their sickness. {126}</p>
<p>“Others will steal from them.</p>
<p>There will be disorder, riots, and strife.</p>
<p>Others will take away their wealth,</p>
<p>And they fall into this through their bad karma. {127}</p>
<p>“The ones who reject my way to buddhahood</p>
<p>Will live in inopportune existences.</p>
<p>They will not see the appearance of a world protector,</p>
<p>A king who is the lord of men, teaching in this world. {128}</p>
<p>“Such fools will not hear the Dharma;</p>
<p>They will be deaf and without thought.</p>
<p>Rejecting this kind of enlightenment,</p>
<p>They will never find peace. {129}</p>
<p>“As the result of the bad karma of rejecting this sūtra</p>
<p>They will be paralyzed and crippled</p>
<p>For many thousand trillions of eons,</p>
<p>As numerous as the sand grains in the Ganges. {130}</p>
<p>“Their gardens will be the hells.</p>
<p>Their homes will be the lower realms.</p>
<p>And they will always be in the form of</p>
<p>A donkey, pig, jackal, or dog. {131}</p>
<p>“Even if they become a human,</p>
<p>At that time their adornments will be</p>
<p>Being blind, deaf, and stupid,</p>
<p>Always poor, and a servant to others. {132}</p>
<p>“Illness will be their clothing:</p>
<p>There will be quintillions of sores on their bodies,</p>
<p>And likewise abscesses, itching, and pustules,</p>
<p>And likewise leprosy, white leprosy, and a rotten smell. {133}</p>
<p>“They will have a strong belief in a self</p>
<p>And the strength of their anger will be great.</p>
<p>Their desires will be very powerful</p>
<p>And they will take pleasure in the vaginas of animals. {134}</p>
<p>“Śārisuta, if I were from today to describe</p>
<p>For an entire eon the harm that comes</p>
<p>To those who reject this sūtra,</p>
<p>I could not finish describing that harm. {135}</p>
<p>“Śārisuta, I have truly taught to you</p>
<p>This very meaning that I see.</p>
<p>You should not teach such a sūtra as this</p>
<p>In the presence of foolish beings. {136}</p>
<p>“You should teach this ultimate truth</p>
<p>To those who are learned, have heard much Dharma,</p>
<p>And who have mindfulness, are wise, have knowledge,</p>
<p>And are set upon supreme enlightenment. {137}</p>
<p>“You should proclaim this ultimate truth</p>
<p>To those who have seen many millions of buddhas,</p>
<p>Who have developed immeasurable merit,</p>
<p>And have a stable, higher motivation. {138}</p>
<p>“You should teach this sūtra directly</p>
<p>To those who are diligent and always kind,</p>
<p>Who for a long time have meditated on kindness,</p>
<p>And who have no concern for body or life. {139}</p>
<p>“Proclaim this excellent sūtra to those</p>
<p>Who are considerate and respectful to each other,</p>
<p>Who do not rely on fools,</p>
<p>And are happy in mountain caves. {140}</p>
<p>“Teach this sūtra</p>
<p>To those children of the buddhas</p>
<p>Whom you see serving kalyāṇamitras,</p>
<p>And who have given up sinful friends. {141}</p>
<p>“Recite this sūtra in the presence</p>
<p>Of those children of the buddhas whom you see</p>
<p>To have unimpaired conduct, who are like precious jewels,</p>
<p>And have a vast possession of sūtras. {142}</p>
<p>“Recite this sūtra in the presence</p>
<p>Of those who are without anger and always honest,</p>
<p>Who have compassion for all beings,</p>
<p>And are respectful in the presence of the Sugata. {143}</p>
<p>“Give the teaching of this sūtra</p>
<p>To those who teach the Dharma in the center of an assembly,</p>
<p>Without impediment, their minds focused,</p>
<p>And who use quintillions of parables, {144}</p>
<p>“And to those who with hands in homage upon their head</p>
<p>Are searching for the state of omniscience,</p>
<p>Who travel in all the ten directions</p>
<p>Seeking a bhikṣu who has the excellent teaching. {145}</p>
<p>“You should teach this supreme sūtra</p>
<p>To those who possess extensive sūtras,</p>
<p>Who do not long for anything else,</p>
<p>And do not retain even one verse from anywhere else. {146}</p>
<p>“Just as when someone possesses a relic of the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>People go in search of it,</p>
<p>In that way they go in search of this sūtra</p>
<p>And, finding it, place it on the crown of their head. {147}</p>
<p>“They never think about other sūtras,</p>
<p>Other worldly treatises that are</p>
<p>In that way the realm of fools.</p>
<p>You should reject them and teach this! {148}</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, I could teach for a whole eon</p>
<p>The many thousand million features of those</p>
<p>Who are set upon the supreme, highest enlightenment;</p>
<p>It is in their presence that you should teach this sūtra.” {149}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Parable,” the third chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Aspiration</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Then Brother Subhūti, Brother Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahā­maudgalyāyana, having heard from the Bhagavān this kind of Dharma that they had never heard before, and having heard directly from the Bhagavān the prophecy of Brother Śāriputra’s attainment of the highest, supreme enlightenment, were amazed, astonished, and overjoyed.</p>
<p>At that time they rose from their seats, approached the Bhagavān, uncovered one shoulder, knelt on their right knees, and with palms together in homage to the Bhagavān, looking directly at the Bhagavān, they inclined their bodies, they bowed their bodies, they bowed well, bowed perfectly.</p>
<p>They said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we are old, aged, and decrepit. We are esteemed to be the elders in the saṅgha of bhikṣus. We are old, infirm, and are said to have attained nirvāṇa. Bhagavān, we do not make the effort to attain unsurpassable complete enlightenment. We do not have the strength to make that effort.</p>
<p>“When the Bhagavān teaches the Dharma, when the Bhagavān is seated for a long time, we too are in the assembly for that Dharma teaching. Bhagavān, while we are reverentially seated there for a long time, we have pains in our limbs and other parts of our bodies, and pains in our main and secondary joints.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, although we express all the emptiness, absence of attributes, and absence of aspiration in the Dharma that the Bhagavān is teaching, we have not hoped for the display of the buddha realms, the play of bodhisattvas, or the play of tathāgatas that are in these dharmas of the Buddha. Why is that? Bhagavān, we have escaped from the three realms and we are said to have attained nirvāṇa. Also we are old and decrepit.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, even though we have taught and instructed other bodhisattvas in the highest, complete enlightenment, we ourselves, Bhagavān, have not given rise to a single wish for such a thing. Bhagavān, we were amazed and astonished to hear from the Bhagavān just now the highest, complete enlightenment being prophesied even for the śrāvakas.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, today we have unexpectedly heard words from the Tathāgata of a kind that we have never heard before, which is a great gain. Bhagavān, we have obtained a great jewel; Bhagavān, we have obtained a priceless great jewel. Bhagavān, we have obtained this kind of jewel without searching for it, without seeking it, without thinking of it, and without wishing for it.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, this is how it appears to us. Sugata, this is how it appears to us.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, it is like the following analogy. A person leaves his father, and having left him, goes to another land. Bhagavān, for many years, for twenty, thirty, forty, until fifty years, he is gone away and has turned into a grown man. He becomes a beggar and searches for sustenance. In order to have food and clothes he travels in every direction in many other lands. His father has come to one of these other lands. The father has much property, grain, treasure, and storehouses. He has much gold, silver, jewels, pearls, beryls, conches, crystals, corals, and gold and silver plate. He has many female slaves, male slaves, workers, and hirelings. He has many elephants, horses, carriages, cattle, and sheep. He has many servants. He is a wealthy man in that great land. He has considerable revenues, interest from loans, and farming and trading businesses.</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, the poor man, seeking food and clothes, wanders through a succession of villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, and capitals, and at last arrives at the town where lives his father, who has much property, grain, treasure, and storehouses. The father always thinks of his son who has been missing for fifty years. yet, although he thinks of him, he says nothing of this to anyone else, but sorrows privately. He thinks to himself, ‘I have become old and decrepit. I have much property, grain, treasure, and storehouses. But I do not have even one son. When my time comes to an end, will not all of this be without an owner and be dispersed?’ In this way he thinks again and again of his son. ‘Alas! If only my son could take possession of this accumulation of wealth, I would be free of sadness.’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, the poor man, wandering in search of food and clothes, comes to the residence of the man who has much money, gold, property, grain, treasure, and storehouses.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the poor man’s father is at the entrance to his home, accompanied by a great assembly of brahmins, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, and śūdras gazing upon him. He is seated in great wealth upon a lion throne with a footstool, adorned in gold and silver. He is being fanned with yak-tail whisks, there is a canopy spread above him, the ground is bestrewn with pearls and flowers, and strings of jewels are hung as decorations.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the poor man sees his father seated among such wealth at the entrance of his own residence encircled by a great crowd of householders as his attendants. As soon as he sees him he is shocked, frightened, afraid, and the hairs on his body stand on end. Terrified, he thinks, ‘I have suddenly come across this king or great minister. There is no reason for me to be here. I shall go to the street where the poor people live. There I can obtain food and clothing without any difficulty. I should not linger here. I do not want to be enslaved or seized, or encounter other kinds of harm.’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, the poor man, frightened and terrified by the thought of continuous suffering, does not stay there but runs far away.</p>
<p>“However, Bhagavān, the wealthy man, seated on the lion throne at the entrance to his residence, recognizes his son as soon as he sees him. The sight makes him happy, thrilled, overjoyed, and delighted. He thinks, ‘This is marvelous! I have seen the one who is to inherit my money, gold, property, grain, treasures, and storehouses. I have become old and aged. I have been thinking of this over and over, and he has arrived here!’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, that man who had been pained by longing for his son, in that very instant, that very moment, commands some people who can run quickly, ‘Friends, go and quickly bring that man to me.’</p>
<p>“So, Bhagavān, those men run quickly to catch the poor man.</p>
<p>“However, Bhagavān, the poor man then becomes frightened, terrified, and alarmed. The hairs on his body stand on end. In dismay, he yells and screams dreadful cries of distress. He cries out, ‘I have done you no wrong!’</p>
<p>“But those men forcibly bring back the poor man, wailing. The poor man, afraid, frightened, terrified, and alarmed, his hairs standing on end, in dismay, thinks, ‘I should not be killed!’ He faints and falls to the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>“His father comes near and says to the men, ‘Don’t bring this man in this way!’ He sprinkles cold water on him and says nothing more. Why? The householder knows that the poor man aspires for something inferior, while he has a high status. He also knows that this is his son.</p>
<p>“At the time, Bhagavān, the householder, using a skillful method, does not at all declare, ‘This is my son!’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, that householder instructs another man, ‘Hey, you there, go to that poor man and say to him, “Oh, you have been freed, go wherever you want to!” ’</p>
<p>“That man listens to this order, goes to the poor man, and says to him, ‘Hey, you have been freed, go wherever you want to!’</p>
<p>“When the poor man hears those words he is amazed and astonished. He gets up from the ground, leaves that place, and goes to the street of the poor people in order to seek clothing and food.</p>
<p>“The householder then uses a skillful method in order to bring the poor man to himself. He employs two people of low caste and shoddy appearance and says to them, ‘Go to the man who came here, taking my instruction that he be given a daily wage to induce him to work in my home. If he asks, “What work can I do?” say to him, “You can work with the two of us clearing away the rubbish heap.” ’</p>
<p>“So the two men go looking for the poor man, and they perform their task. Those two men and the poor man are then employed by the wealthy man and clear away the rubbish heap in his residence. They make their home in a straw hut beside the wealthy man’s house.</p>
<p>“The rich man, through a round window, sees his son clearing away the rubbish, and seeing him he is again astonished. The householder then takes off his garlands and jewelry, takes off his soft, clean, beautiful clothes, puts on dirty clothes, and comes down out from his residence, holding a basket in his left hand, and with his limbs dirtied with earth.</p>
<p>“He greets his son from afar, and approaches him. Having approached, he says, ‘Don’t stay here, take baskets and carry the rubbish away.’ Using this method he is able to converse with his son. Then he says, ‘Oh, you should work here. You should not go elsewhere. I shall give you a greater wage. Whatever it is you need you can unhesitatingly ask me for it, whether it is the price of a bowl, the price of a water pot, the price of a cooking pot, the price of wood, the price of salt, or the price of food or clothes. I have an old cloth, sir, and if you need it ask for it and I will give to you. Oh, whatever kind of utensil it is that you need, sir, I will give it to you. You be happy! Think of me as if I were your father. Why? It is because I am older and you are younger. You have done much work for me by clearing away the rubbish heap. My, you have done this work without deceit, deception, dishonesty, pride, hypocrisy, or ingratitude. My, I have not seen you to have even one fault, such as I have perceived in other men who work. From this day on you will be like my own son born from me.’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, that householder calls that that poor man ‘son,’ and the poor man thinks of the householder as being his father.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the householder who longed for his son in that way has him clearing away the rubbish heaps for twenty years. After twenty years have passed, the poor man has no anxiety about coming in and out of the householder’s residence, and lives there in the straw hut.</p>
<p>“By that time, Bhagavān, the householder has become weaker, and he perceives that he is approaching the time of his death. He says to the poor man, ‘Oh, you, come here! I have much money, gold, property, grain, treasure, and storehouses. I have become very weak. I wish to give them to someone who will take them, who will preserve them. All this you should know. Why is that? Just as I have been the owner of this wealth, so are you. You will not waste anything of mine.’</p>
<p>“So, Bhagavān, the poor man in this way comes to know of that householder’s great amount of money, gold, property, grain, treasure, and storehouses. He has no desire for them. He does not ask for any of it, not even something the value of a prastha of flour. He continues to live in the straw hut, thinking the thoughts of a poor person.</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, the householder sees that his son has developed, and is capable of preserving his wealth; he sees that his mind is refined, such that his outlook is heightened and he is distressed by his previous poor man’s way of thinking—he is disgusted by it, ashamed of it, and loathes it.</p>
<p>“As he is approaching the time of his death he summons the poor man and presents him to a great gathering of many kinsmen. Then he openly pronounces in the presence of the king, the ministers, the townspeople, and the citizens of the land, ‘Listen, all of you, this is my own rightful son, of such and such a town, whom I lost fifty years ago. His name is such and such. My name is such and such. In order to find him I came here from that town. This is my son. I am his father. Whatever it is that I own, all of it I bestow upon him. He has full knowledge of even the least of the possessions that I have.’</p>
<p>“Then, Bhagavān, the poor man, hearing at that time those words, is amazed and astonished. He thinks, ‘Suddenly I have obtained such money, gold, property, grain, treasure, and storehouses!’</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, in the same way we are like the Tathāgata’s sons and the Tathāgata, just like that householder, has said to us, ‘You are my sons.’</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we are pained by the three sufferings. What are those three? They are the suffering of suffering, the suffering of the composite, and the suffering of change. Within saṃsāra, we have had an inferior aspiration. Therefore, Bhagavān, we have contemplated many Dharma teachings that are similar to a rubbish heap, and we have been devoted to them, intent upon them, and dedicated to them.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we have sought and requested nirvāṇa alone, just like that daily wage. Therefore, Bhagavān, we have been satisfied by the attainment of nirvāṇa. We thought that we had obtained a great deal, and were devoted to, intent upon, and dedicated to these dharmas from the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata knew our inferior aspiration, and therefore the Bhagavān tolerated us and did not say to us, ‘This is the Tathāgata’s treasure of wisdom, which will be yours.’</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, through a skillful method you have bestowed upon us our inheritance of the Tathāgata’s treasure of wisdom.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we had no desire for it. We thought, ‘We have obtained a great deal,’ meaning nirvāṇa from the Tathāgata, which is like that daily wage.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, beginning with the Tathāgata’s wisdom, we have explained his whole immense Dharma teaching to the bodhisattva mahāsattvas; we have revealed, taught, and explained the Tathāgata’s wisdom, Bhagavān, but we ourselves have had no aspiration for it. Why is that? The Tathāgata, with a skillful method, knew our aspirations, and we did not know, did not understand when the Bhagavān said that we are true sons of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān has made us remember our inheritance of the Tathāgata’s wisdom. Why is that? It is because we are true sons of the Tathāgata, but we have also had inferior aspiration. If the Bhagavān sees strength in our aspiration, the Bhagavān declares us to be bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān has given us two tasks to perform: in the presence of the bodhisattvas we are said to be those with inferior aspiration; and this, in turn, inspires them to the enlightenment of buddhahood. When the Bhagavān sees strength in our motivation then he declares this.</p>
<p>“In this way, Bhagavān, we say, ‘We have unexpectedly, without desiring it, obtained the jewel of omniscience that we did not long for, did not search for, did not seek for, did not think of, and did not wish for, just like the sons of the Tathāgata.’ ”</p>
<p>Then at that time Mahākāśyapa recited these verses:</p>
<p>“We are amazed and astonished</p>
<p>And overjoyed to have heard your words.</p>
<p>We have on this day unexpectedly</p>
<p>Heard the pleasant speech of the Guide. {1}</p>
<p>“In just a moment we have obtained today</p>
<p>A multitude of great, excellent jewels.</p>
<p>We are all astonished to have heard</p>
<p>That which we had not thought of nor wished for at all. {2}</p>
<p>“It is like when a person who is foolish</p>
<p>And who is influenced by foolish people</p>
<p>Abandons his father’s residence</p>
<p>And wanders through other lands. {3}</p>
<p>“The father at that time is sorrowful,</p>
<p>Knowing that his son has fled,</p>
<p>And for no fewer than fifty years</p>
<p>In sorrow he searches the ten directions. {4}</p>
<p>“Then in seeking for his son</p>
<p>He arrives at another great city</p>
<p>Where he establishes a residence</p>
<p>And possesses the five sensory pleasures. {5}</p>
<p>“He has much money, gold, and silver;</p>
<p>Property, grain, conch, crystal, and coral;</p>
<p>And many elephants, horses, and foot soldiers,</p>
<p>Cows, cattle, and also sheep. {6}</p>
<p>“He has revenues, interest from loans, and similarly land,</p>
<p>Male slaves, female slaves, and a crowd of servants.</p>
<p>He is attended to by billions of beings</p>
<p>And is always a favorite of the king. {7}</p>
<p>“The citizens make the gesture of homage to him</p>
<p>As do the villagers who live in the villages.</p>
<p>Many merchants come to see him,</p>
<p>And through many activities pay him service. {8}</p>
<p>“That man who is wealthy in that way</p>
<p>Has become old, aged, and feeble.</p>
<p>Continually, day and night,</p>
<p>His thoughts are of sadness over his son. {9}</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, who was so foolish,</p>
<p>Ran away fifty years ago.</p>
<p>I possess such vast treasure as this,</p>
<p>And I am close to the time of my death.’ {10}</p>
<p>“At that time, his son, the fool,</p>
<p>Is always poor and wretched.</p>
<p>He wanders from village to village</p>
<p>Seeking food and also a garment. {11}</p>
<p>“While he is searching he sometimes</p>
<p>Obtains something and sometimes nothing.</p>
<p>He becomes emaciated and seeks refuge from others,</p>
<p>His body covered by skin infections and itches. {12}</p>
<p>“He arrives at the city</p>
<p>Where his father lives.</p>
<p>While he is seeking food and clothing</p>
<p>He eventually comes to his own father’s house. {13}</p>
<p>“The rich man who has great wealth</p>
<p>Is seated on a lion throne at the entrance.</p>
<p>He is encircled by many hundreds of people</p>
<p>And a canopy is spread in the air above him. {14}</p>
<p>“All around him are his trusted people.</p>
<p>Some are counting wealth and money,</p>
<p>Some are writing out documents,</p>
<p>And some are calculating interest. {15}</p>
<p>“When the poor man sees there</p>
<p>This beautified residence of the householder,</p>
<p>He thinks, ‘Where have I arrived today?</p>
<p>This must be the home of a king or a minister. {16}</p>
<p>“ ‘May I do nothing wrong here</p>
<p>Or be seized and pressed into forced labor!’</p>
<p>Thinking this, the man runs away,</p>
<p>Asking where is the street of the poor people. {17}</p>
<p>“The rich man, sitting on his lion throne,</p>
<p>Becomes overjoyed on seeing his son.</p>
<p>He dispatches some messengers after him,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Bring me this poor man!’ {18}</p>
<p>“They immediately seize that man,</p>
<p>Who faints as soon as he is seized,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘I am certainly about to be slain!</p>
<p>What use are food and clothes to me now?’ {19}</p>
<p>“The wise, rich man sees this and thinks,</p>
<p>‘This unwise fool has inferior aspiration,</p>
<p>And he will not believe, “This wealth is for me!”</p>
<p>He will not believe, “This is my father!” ’ {20}</p>
<p>“He arranges there for some people,</p>
<p>Inferior beings in ragged clothes,</p>
<p>Crooked, one-eyed, and maimed,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Seek that working man! {21}</p>
<p>“ ‘Say that I will give him a double wage</p>
<p>To do the work of clearing away</p>
<p>My rotting heap of rubbish</p>
<p>And unhealthy urine and feces.’ {22}</p>
<p>“The man hears those words and</p>
<p>Comes and cleans that place.</p>
<p>He makes his abode there</p>
<p>In a straw hut beside that residence. {23}</p>
<p>“The rich man is always looking</p>
<p>Through a round window at the man,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘My son, with inferior aspiration,</p>
<p>Works at clearing away rubbish heaps.’ {24}</p>
<p>“He comes down, holding a basket</p>
<p>And wearing dirty clothes.</p>
<p>He comes up to that man and scolds him,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘You are not working!’ {25}</p>
<p>“ ‘I give you double wages,</p>
<p>I give you double oil for the feet,</p>
<p>I give you food with salt,</p>
<p>I also give you vegetables and cloth!’ {26}</p>
<p>“In that way he rebukes him at that time,</p>
<p>And then the wise one increases their bond,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘You do your work well here!</p>
<p>You are truly my son, have no doubt about it.’ {27}</p>
<p>“Then, gradually, he brings him into the house,</p>
<p>And for an entire twenty years</p>
<p>He gives that man work to do,</p>
<p>And by degrees makes the man confident. {28}</p>
<p>“He stores the crystal, money, and pearls</p>
<p>There inside this residence.</p>
<p>He keeps a count of it all</p>
<p>And keeps all that wealth in mind. {29}</p>
<p>“The fool lives alone in the hut</p>
<p>Outside of that residence.</p>
<p>In his mind he has the thoughts of a poor person,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘I do not own any of this property.’ {30}</p>
<p>“When the rich man knows, ‘My son has</p>
<p>In this way heightened his outlook,’</p>
<p>He invites a crowd of friends and kinsmen</p>
<p>And says, ‘On this one I shall bestow all my wealth.’ {31}</p>
<p>“He holds a gathering of the royal family,</p>
<p>The citizens, and many merchants.</p>
<p>He states in the middle of that assembly,</p>
<p>‘This is my son, whom I lost a long time ago. {32}</p>
<p>“ ‘Fifty full years passed by after that,</p>
<p>And since I saw him another twenty.</p>
<p>I lost him in the city of such and such a name,</p>
<p>And it was in search of him that I came here. {33}</p>
<p>“ ‘This man is the owner of all that I possess.</p>
<p>I bestow it all without remainder upon him.</p>
<p>He may use his father’s wealth</p>
<p>And I give to him my entire family fortune.’ {34}</p>
<p>“That man is astonished;</p>
<p>He thinks of his previous poverty,</p>
<p>His inferior aspiration, and his father’s qualities:</p>
<p>‘Today I have obtained my family fortune and I am happy.’ {35}</p>
<p>“In that same way the Guide,</p>
<p>Knowing we had inferior aspiration,</p>
<p>Did not proclaim, ‘You will become buddhas!’</p>
<p>But said, ‘You, śrāvakas, are my sons!’ {36}</p>
<p>“The Lord of the World has said to us,</p>
<p>‘Kāśyapa, teach the unsurpassable path</p>
<p>To those set upon supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>Through meditation on that path they will become buddhas.’ {37}</p>
<p>“Thus instructed by the Sugata,</p>
<p>We teach the highest path</p>
<p>With quintillions of causes and parables</p>
<p>To many bodhisattvas with great strength. {38}</p>
<p>“The sons of the Jina, having listened to us,</p>
<p>Meditate on the supreme path to enlightenment</p>
<p>And immediately receive the prophecy,</p>
<p>‘You will become buddhas in this world.’ {39}</p>
<p>“In that way we work for the Guide</p>
<p>Just like that trustworthy man,</p>
<p>Taking care of this treasure of the Dharma</p>
<p>And teaching it to the sons of the Jina. {40}</p>
<p>“Thinking with a poor man’s outlook,</p>
<p>Though we gave to others the treasure of the Buddha</p>
<p>And taught them the wisdom of the Jina,</p>
<p>We did not wish for the wisdom of the Jina. {41}</p>
<p>“We believe we have personal nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And have no other wisdom than that.</p>
<p>We were never gladdened by hearing</p>
<p>Descriptions of the realms of the buddhas. {42}</p>
<p>“ ‘All these dharmas are immaculate, peaceful,</p>
<p>And devoid of cessation and birth.</p>
<p>And there is no dharma that exists in this.’</p>
<p>When we contemplated that we had no faith in it. {43}</p>
<p>“For a long time we have had no wish</p>
<p>For the highest wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>We never made any prayers of aspiration</p>
<p>For the ultimate conclusion taught by the Jina. {44}</p>
<p>“In this body that concludes in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>We have meditated a long time on emptiness.</p>
<p>We are freed from the pain of suffering in the three realms.</p>
<p>We have carried out the teaching of the Jina. {45}</p>
<p>“We have never developed a longing</p>
<p>For that which we teach to the progeny of the Jina,</p>
<p>That Dharma that we have taught to those</p>
<p>Who are set upon supreme enlightenment. {46}</p>
<p>“The self-arisen Master of the World</p>
<p>Tolerated us, awaiting the right time.</p>
<p>Examining our aspiration, he did not teach us</p>
<p>The true meaning of the teachings with implied meaning. {47}</p>
<p>“With timely skillful method</p>
<p>That very wealthy man</p>
<p>Constantly trained his son who had inferior aspiration,</p>
<p>And when he was trained bestowed his wealth upon him. {48}</p>
<p>“The Lord of the World has accomplished what is difficult,</p>
<p>Through teaching with skillful methods.</p>
<p>He has trained the sons who have inferior aspiration</p>
<p>And, having trained them, given them this wisdom of the buddhas. {49}</p>
<p>“Just like the poor man who obtained wealth,</p>
<p>We are astonished that suddenly today</p>
<p>We have obtained in the Buddha’s teaching</p>
<p>This principal, immaculate, chief result. {50}</p>
<p>“We have maintained for a long time the good conduct</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Knower of the World</p>
<p>And today, Lord, we have obtained the result</p>
<p>Of that good conduct we have previously practiced. {51}</p>
<p>“We have practiced in the teachings of the Guide</p>
<p>The completely pure, highest celibacy.</p>
<p>And today we have obtained its exceptional result,</p>
<p>Which is a vast and immaculate peace. {52}</p>
<p>“Today, Lord, we who are śrāvakas</p>
<p>Will proclaim the highest enlightenment.</p>
<p>We will teach the word enlightenment,</p>
<p>Therefore we will be formidable śrāvakas. {53}</p>
<p>“Today, Lord, we who are arhats</p>
<p>Have become worthy of receiving the offerings</p>
<p>Of the world and its devas, māras,</p>
<p>Brahmakāyikas, and by all beings. {54}</p>
<p>“Who is there who could repay you</p>
<p>Even by striving for many millions of eons?</p>
<p>You accomplish that which is difficult to do,</p>
<p>The difficult deeds that are in this mortal world. {55}</p>
<p>“It would be difficult to repay your kindness</p>
<p>Even with one’s hands, feet, and head;</p>
<p>Even if one were to carry you on one’s head and shoulders</p>
<p>For as many eons as sand grains in the Ganges; {56}</p>
<p>“Even if one were to give meals, food, drink, and clothes,</p>
<p>Bedding and seats, and stainless upper robes;</p>
<p>Even if one were to give temples constructed from sandalwood,</p>
<p>Which are spread with sewn-together calico cloths; {57}</p>
<p>“Even if one were to always make offerings to the Sugata</p>
<p>Of many different kinds of medicine when there is sickness</p>
<p>For as many eons as there are sand grains in the Ganges—</p>
<p>Even that would never be able to repay your kindness. {58}</p>
<p>“Those who have the qualities of greatness, who are unequaled,</p>
<p>Who have great miraculous powers and are established in the strength of patience,</p>
<p>The buddhas, those great immaculate kings, the jinas,</p>
<p>Have patience for such fools as these. {59}</p>
<p>“The Lord of Dharma, the Lord of the Entire World,</p>
<p>The Great Lord, the Lord who is the Guide of the World</p>
<p>Teaches the Dharma to those who are involved in the characteristics of appearances,</p>
<p>At all times adapting to them in that way. {60}</p>
<p>“Knowing the various states of beings,</p>
<p>He teaches many kinds of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Knowing their various aspirations,</p>
<p>He teaches the Dharma through thousands of causes. {61}</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata, knowing the conduct</p>
<p>Of all beings and individuals,</p>
<p>Teaches the Dharma in various ways</p>
<p>And reveals this highest enlightenment.” {62}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Aspiration,” the fourth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Herbs</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Mahākāśyapa and the other great sthaviras, “Excellent! Excellent, Kāśyapa! It is excellent, Kāśyapa, that you have praised the true qualities of the Tathāgata. Kāśyapa, those are qualities of the Tathāgata. There are immeasurably and innumerably more than those. It would not be easy to enumerate them entirely even in countless eons.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata is the Lord of the Dharma. He is the principal King of All the Dharmas. Kāśyapa, whatever Dharma the Tathāgata presents, and the way he presents it, that is how it is. Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata presents all dharmas correctly. He presents them through the wisdom of a tathāgata, so that those dharmas lead to the state of omniscience. The Tathāgata sees the stages of meaning in all the dharmas. He has attained the superior motivation concerning all the dharmas. He has attained the supreme, highest wisdom of skillful methods in bringing certainty in all the dharmas. Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha teaches the wisdom of omniscience, he brings the realization of omniscience, and he presents the wisdom of omniscience.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, it is like this: There are all the plants, bushes, herbs, and forest trees of many different colors and different kinds, and herbs with various names that grow on the plains, the mountains, and mountain valleys in this world realm of a billion worlds. A great cloud filled with water rises up, and having risen covers all the worlds in the all-containing realm of a billion worlds. Having covered them all, rain falls simultaneously and equally everywhere on all of them.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the young and tender stems, branches, leaves, and petals, and the half-grown stems, branches, leaves, and petals, and the fully grown stems, branches, leaves, and petals among the plants, bushes, herbs, and forest trees in this world realm of a billion worlds all drink the element of water released from the great cloud in accordance with their strength and location. That great water with a single taste that was released from one great cloud appropriately makes the seeds sprout, develop, and grow. Similarly it produces flowers and fruits. Each one of those acquires its own individual name. There are multitudes of herbs and multitudes of seeds all on the same earth that are soaked by the water that has a single taste.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha appears in the world in that way. Just as the great cloud rises, the Tathāgata appears and causes the entire world, with its devas, humans, and asuras, to hear his speech.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, just as that great cloud covers all the worlds in the all-containing world realm of a billion worlds, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha emits sound before the world with its devas, humans, and asuras, so that they hear his voice, declaring, ‘Devas and humans! I am the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha! I have crossed over and I bring across! I am liberated and I liberate! I am relieved and I bring relief! I have attained nirvāṇa and bring others to the attainment of nirvāṇa! With perfect wisdom I have correct knowledge of this world and the next world! I am omniscient and all-seeing! Devas and humans, you should come to me in order to hear the Dharma! I am one who makes known the path! I am one who teaches the path! I am one who knows the path! I am one who is skilled in the path!’</p>
<p>“In that way, Kāśyapa, many hundred thousand quintillions of beings come to the Tathāgata in order to hear the Dharma. The Tathāgata knows their higher and lower levels of capacity and diligence and provides them with Dharma teachings. I have taught many different kinds of Dharma discourses to various kinds of individuals so as to delight them, please them, bring them joy, and bring them benefit and happiness. Through those teachings those beings will have happiness in this life and at death will be reborn in happy existences. Wherever they are reborn, even though they enjoy many desires, they will listen to the Dharma, and having heard the Dharma they will become devoid of obscurations and finally they will enter the Dharma of omniscience, in accordance with their strength, location, and power.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, it is like when a great cloud covers all the worlds in the all-containing realm of a billion worlds and lets fall rain equally everywhere on the plants, bushes, herbs, and forest trees, and satisfies them with water. The plants, bushes, herbs, and forest trees drink the water in accordance with their strength, location, and power, and each of them grows in accordance with their individual species.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha teaches the Dharma in that way. The entire Dharma has one taste—the one taste of liberation, freedom from desire, cessation, and the ultimate wisdom of omniscience.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the beings who listen to, retain, and practice the Dharma that the Tathāgata teaches do not comprehend, know, or understand themselves. Why is that? Kāśyapa, it is the Tathāgata who knows those beings—who they are, how they are, and what kind they are; what they think, how they think, and why they think; what they meditate on, how they meditate, and why they meditate; and what they attain, how they attain it, and why they attain it.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, it is the Tathāgata who has direct knowledge of them, direct perception of them, and sees them as they are.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, I have realized the one taste of the Dharma: the one taste of liberation, ultimate nirvāṇa, the eternal nirvāṇa, the single level, and the domain of space. However, in order to preserve the faith of beings—the beings who are on this and that level, higher, middling, and lower, like the plants, bushes, herbs, and forest trees—I do not immediately teach them the wisdom of omniscience.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, you are astonished because you were not able to penetrate into the Tathāgata’s teaching that contained an implied meaning. Why was that? Kāśyapa, it is because the teachings with implied meaning given by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas are difficult to understand.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān taught this meaning in detail, at this time giving his teaching in verses:</p>
<p>“I am the Dharma King who has appeared in the world.</p>
<p>I am the crusher of existence.</p>
<p>Knowing their aspirations</p>
<p>I teach the Dharma to beings. {1}</p>
<p>“With unwavering understanding I have maintained</p>
<p>The teaching of the great heroes for a long time.</p>
<p>They also possess that which is secret,</p>
<p>Which they do not teach to beings. {2}</p>
<p>“That wisdom is difficult to understand</p>
<p>For the foolish who suddenly hear it.</p>
<p>They will have doubts, complete misunderstanding,</p>
<p>And they will fall away and wander. {3}</p>
<p>“I teach according to their range</p>
<p>And according to their strength.</p>
<p>By using different meanings,</p>
<p>I make their view correct. {4}</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, there is a cloud</p>
<p>That appears in the world</p>
<p>And spreads over the land</p>
<p>And covers over everything. {5}</p>
<p>“That great cloud, flashing with lightning,</p>
<p>Is completely filled with water.</p>
<p>It resounds with sound,</p>
<p>Bringing joy to all beings. {6}</p>
<p>“It obscures the sunlight</p>
<p>And it cools the land.</p>
<p>When it is within hand’s reach,</p>
<p>Its rain falls everywhere. {7}</p>
<p>“Although it falls equally,</p>
<p>The mass of water is vast.</p>
<p>It flows everywhere,</p>
<p>Satiating this earth. {8}</p>
<p>“Whatever herbs there are</p>
<p>That grow from this ground;</p>
<p>Plants, bushes, and forest trees,</p>
<p>Small trees and great trees; {9}</p>
<p>“The many kinds of crops</p>
<p>That will become green;</p>
<p>Whatever grows on mountains,</p>
<p>In ravines, forests, and dells, {10}</p>
<p>“The cloud satiates them all.</p>
<p>It satiates the parched earth</p>
<p>And the plants, bushes, and forest trees,</p>
<p>And it bathes the herbs. {11}</p>
<p>“Those waters have one taste.</p>
<p>They fall from the cloud and remain here.</p>
<p>The plants and bushes drink them</p>
<p>According to their strength and location. {12}</p>
<p>“The small trees and the great trees,</p>
<p>Whether young, middling, or full grown,</p>
<p>They drink the water according to their strength,</p>
<p>And having drunk it they grow as they wish. {13}</p>
<p>“Because the rain falls from the cloud, the great herbs</p>
<p>Grow their stems, hollow stalks, and skins,</p>
<p>Their spreading branches and their leaves,</p>
<p>And likewise their fruits and flowers. {14}</p>
<p>“According to their strength and location,</p>
<p>The fallen rain, which has a single taste,</p>
<p>Germinates each and every thing</p>
<p>That is dwelling within its seed. {15}</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, in that way the Buddha in this world</p>
<p>Appears like a rain-bearing cloud over the world.</p>
<p>The Lord of the World, having appeared, teaches,</p>
<p>Expounding the true practice to beings. {16}</p>
<p>“In that way the great Rishi,</p>
<p>Revered by the world and its devas, proclaims:</p>
<p>‘I am the Tathāgata, the supreme human, the Jina,</p>
<p>Appearing like a cloud in this world. {17}</p>
<p>“ ‘I bring satiation to all beings who have withered bodies</p>
<p>And are attached to the three existences.</p>
<p>I bring happiness to those who are withered by suffering</p>
<p>And give them their desires and nirvāṇa. {18}</p>
<p>“ ‘Multitudes of devas and humans, listen to me!</p>
<p>Approach so that you may look upon me!</p>
<p>I am the Tathāgata, the unsurpassable Bhagavān!</p>
<p>I have been born into this world to bring liberation. {19}</p>
<p>“ ‘I teach thousands of millions of beings.</p>
<p>I shall fully reveal to them the pure Dharma.</p>
<p>Its true nature is a single equality,</p>
<p>Which is liberation and nirvāṇa. {20}</p>
<p>“ ‘I teach the Dharma with one voice,</p>
<p>Doing so always for the sake of enlightenment.</p>
<p>It has equality and has no inequality.</p>
<p>There is no desire, and there is no aversion. {21}</p>
<p>“ ‘I never need to be appeased,</p>
<p>I have no affection or malice for anyone.</p>
<p>I teach the Dharma equally to all beings,</p>
<p>As if others were all one being. {22}</p>
<p>“ ‘I teach the Dharma and do nothing else.</p>
<p>Whether walking, standing, or sitting,</p>
<p>Whether seated on a cushion, or lying on a bed,</p>
<p>I never give rise to weariness. {23}</p>
<p>“ ‘I bring satiation to all the world,</p>
<p>Like a cloud that rains equally on all,</p>
<p>With an outlook of equality, on the superior and inferior,</p>
<p>On those with good conduct and those without good conduct, {24}</p>
<p>“ ‘And the same for people who have lost their practice,</p>
<p>And those who are endowed with proper practice and conduct,</p>
<p>Those who hold the view, and those who have lost the view,</p>
<p>And those who have the true view, and those who have a pure view. {25}</p>
<p>“ ‘I teach the Dharma to those with little capacity,</p>
<p>To those with inferior and those with higher understanding.</p>
<p>I have eliminated all weariness</p>
<p>And perfectly send down a rain of the Dharma. {26}</p>
<p>“ ‘Listening to me, according to their strengths,</p>
<p>They are established on various levels:</p>
<p>As beautiful devas and humans,</p>
<p>As Śakras, Brahmās, and as cakravartins. {27}</p>
<p>“ ‘Listen! I shall explain all</p>
<p>These tiny, minute herbs,</p>
<p>Those that are small in the world,</p>
<p>And the other medium and large herbs. {28}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those humans who know the immaculate Dharma</p>
<p>And remain in the attainment of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Those who have the six higher knowledges and the three insights</p>
<p>Are declared to be the tiny herbs. {29}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those humans who dwell in mountain defiles</p>
<p>And aspire to pratyeka­buddhahood,</p>
<p>Those who have a medium pure understanding,</p>
<p>Are declared to be the medium-sized herbs. {30}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who aspire to be the leaders of beings,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘I will be a buddha, lord of devas and humans,’</p>
<p>And are practicing diligence and dhyāna,</p>
<p>Are declared to be the highest herbs. {31}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those dedicated children of the Sugata,</p>
<p>Who practice kindness and whose conduct is peaceful,</p>
<p>And have no doubts about the Leader of Beings</p>
<p>Are in this way said to be the trees. {32}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who turn the wheel of irreversibility,</p>
<p>Are brave and established in strengths and miracles,</p>
<p>And liberate many millions of beings</p>
<p>Are declared to be the great trees. {33}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Jina teaches the Dharma equally,</p>
<p>Like the rain falling equally from a cloud.</p>
<p>Those who have various higher knowledges</p>
<p>Are like the herbs upon the surface of the ground. {34}</p>
<p>“ ‘Understand the method of the Tathāgata</p>
<p>Through the teaching of this analogy.</p>
<p>While he teaches one Dharma</p>
<p>The various words are like the drops of rain. {35}</p>
<p>“ ‘I send down a rain of the Dharma</p>
<p>That satiates all these beings in the world.</p>
<p>The Dharma that is taught has but one taste</p>
<p>But beings contemplate it according to their abilities. {36}</p>
<p>“ ‘When it rains, the plants and bushes,</p>
<p>The medium-sized herbs,</p>
<p>The trees and big trees</p>
<p>In all ten directions are beautified. {37}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Dharma thus benefits the world constantly,</p>
<p>Satiating the entire world with Dharma.</p>
<p>The entire world having been satiated,</p>
<p>Flowers arise from the herbs. {38}</p>
<p>“ ‘The medium-sized herbs that grow</p>
<p>Are the arhats whose defilements have ceased,</p>
<p>And the pratyeka­buddhas who in the forests</p>
<p>Practice the well-taught Dharma. {39}</p>
<p>“ ‘Many unwavering bodhisattvas, endowed with mindfulness,</p>
<p>Who have comprehended the entirety of the three realms,</p>
<p>Who are seeking this supreme enlightenment,</p>
<p>Are like the continually growing trees. {40}</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who have miraculous powers and reside in the four dhyānas,</p>
<p>Who are overjoyed to hear the teaching of emptiness,</p>
<p>And who radiate thousands of light rays</p>
<p>Are said to be the great trees.’ {41}</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the Dharma is taught in this way:</p>
<p>Like the rain falling equally from a cloud</p>
<p>And an endless multitude of human flowers,</p>
<p>A multitude of great herbs grow. {42}</p>
<p>“I teach the Dharma that I have myself realized,</p>
<p>And teach buddhahood’s enlightenment at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>My skill in methods is supreme,</p>
<p>And that of all the guides of the world. {43}</p>
<p>“In this way I teach the true ultimate truth:</p>
<p>All those śrāvakas have not attained nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>When they have practiced the way of enlightenment</p>
<p>Then all those śrāvakas will become buddhas. {44}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Kāśyapa, the Tathāgata guides beings equally, without any inequality.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, it is like this: The light of the sun and moon illuminates the entire world. The light shines equally, without any inequality, on the good and the bad, the high and the low, the aromatic and the foul-smelling.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, in that way the light of the omniscient wisdom of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas brings the Dharma equally to all beings who have been born in the five states of existence, whatever their aspirations, whether they are of the Mahāyāna, of the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, or of the Śrāvakayāna. In that way the wisdom of the Tathāgata is never lacking and never superfluous, so that there is thus the attainment of merit and wisdom.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, there are not three yānas. It is only because of the different practices of beings that there are said to be three yānas.”</p>
<p>Then Brother Mahākāśyapa asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, if there are not three yānas, why at this time are there said to be the designations of śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, and bodhisattvas?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to Brother Mahākāśyapa, “Kāśyapa, it is like this: A potter makes all bowls from clay equally. Some of them become bowls that hold molasses, some of them become bowls that hold ghee, and some of them become bowls that hold curds or milk, some of them become bowls that hold bad and impure substances. There is no difference in their clay. It is only because of the substances placed within them that they are said to be different kinds of bowls.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, in that way there is this one yāna, which is the Buddhayāna, and there is no second or third yāna.”</p>
<p>Then Brother Mahākāśyapa asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, when beings with different aspirations depart from the three realms, do they have the one nirvāṇa or is there a second or third nirvāṇa?”</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa,” replied the Bhagavān, “nirvāṇa is the realization of the equality of all phenomena, and therefore there is the one nirvāṇa, and there is no second or third nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, some wise beings will understand the meaning through the teaching of a parable, and therefore I shall teach you a parable.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, it is like this: A man who is blind from birth says, ‘There are no forms with good color or bad color. There is no one who sees forms with good color or bad color. There are no sun and moon. There are no stars. There are no planets. There is no one who sees planets.’</p>
<p>“Then some other people say in front of that born-blind man, ‘There are good colors and bad colors. There are those who see forms with good color or bad color. There are a sun and moon. There are stars. There are planets. There are those who see planets.’</p>
<p>“The born-blind man does not have faith in those people, and does not believe what they have said.</p>
<p>“A physician who knows every illness sees the blind man and thinks, ‘That man has an illness because of his past bad karma. Every illness is one of four kinds: caused by air, caused by bile, caused by phlegm, or caused by their combination.’</p>
<p>“Then the physician thinks again and again as to what method would cure the man of his illness. He thinks, ‘The medicines that are available here will not be able to cure him, but there are four kinds of herbs on the king of mountains, the Himalayas.’ What are these four? First there is the one named endowed with all colors and tastes, the second is called freedom from all illness, the third is called elimination of all poisons, and the fourth is called bestowing happiness anywhere. Those are the four herbs.</p>
<p>“Then the physician, feeling compassion for the born-blind man, contemplates by what method he would be able to go to the king of mountain ranges, the Himalayas. He goes there and, searching for them, he climbs up, climbs down, and traverses their slopes. Searching in that way he finds the four herbs. After finding them, some he gives after grinding them with his teeth, some he gives after crushing them, some he gives after mixing them with other substances and then cooking them, some he gives after mixing them with other substances uncooked, some he gives after piercing a point on the body with a needle, some he gives after burning them with fire, and some he gives after mixing them with each other, and also mixing them with food, drink, and so on. Through the application of these methods the born-blind man gains sight.</p>
<p>“When he has gained sight he sees outside and inside, far and near, the light of the moon, the sunlight, the stars, the planets, and all forms. He says, ‘Oh, I was so stupid before in not believing what was taught to me, not accepting what was said. Now I can see everything! I am freed from blindness!’</p>
<p>“At that time there are rishis who have the five higher knowledges: divine sight, divine hearing, the knowledge of others’ minds, memory of previous lives, and mastery of miraculous powers. They say to the man, ‘Oh, all you obtained is your sight. If you have no other knowledge, why are you proud? You have no wisdom. You have no sagacity.’</p>
<p>“They also say to him, ‘You know, when you are sitting inside a house, you do not see the forms that are outside. You do not know the kind thoughts or malicious thoughts of beings. You do not know, do not hear, the sounds of people speaking, or the sounds of drums, conches, and so on, which are five yojanas away. You are not able to travel one krośa without taking a step with your feet. You are not able to remember the activity of being conceived and growing in your mother’s womb. So how can you be sagacious? How can you say that you see everything? Oh, you think that light is darkness. You think that darkness is light!’</p>
<p>“Then that man says to the rishis, ‘Through what method and through what good actions can I attain such wisdom as that, and through your benevolence attain these qualities?’</p>
<p>“ ‘If you wish for those you must dwell in a solitary place,’ say the rishis to that man, ‘or, staying in a cave, you should contemplate the Dharma. You should forsake all the afflictions of the mind. If in this way you have the qualities of a mendicant, you will attain higher knowledge.’</p>
<p>“That man then adopts that goal and entering homelessness he resides in solitude. With a one-pointed mind he abandons craving for this world and attains the five higher knowledges. Having obtained the five higher knowledges, he thinks, ‘I did not attain any qualities whatsoever through the other actions I had performed in the past. Now I can go wherever I think of. In the past, I had little wisdom and little insight. I was blind.’</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, I have made this parable so that its meaning can be understood. Its meaning should be seen in this way:</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the blind man represents the beings who dwell in the saṃsāra of the five kinds of existences. Those who do not know the good Dharma generate the black darkness of the kleśas and have the blindness of ignorance. Those who are blind with ignorance accumulate formations. Through the factor of formation there is name-and-form, and so on until the arising of a great mass of sheer suffering. In that way they are blinded by ignorance. The Tathāgata has compassion for the beings in saṃsāra, and although he has transcended the three realms he has love for them like that of a father for his only son. With great compassion he goes to the three realms. The Bhagavān looks with eyes of wisdom upon the beings who are afflicted and wandering in the cycle of saṃsāra and do not know how to leave saṃsāra. Seeing them he knows, ‘These beings, because of their previous good actions, have little anger and great desire, while these have little desire and great anger; some have little wisdom, some are wise; and some are ripened and pure, and some hold wrong views.’ The Tathāgata, using a skillful method, teaches three yānas to those beings.</p>
<p>“The rishis with the five higher knowledges and pure vision are the bodhisattvas who have developed the aspiration for enlightenment, attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.</p>
<p>“The great physician should be seen to be the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“The born-blind man should be seen to be beings who are blinded by ignorance.</p>
<p>“Air, bile, and phlegm should be seen as desire, anger, ignorance, and the sixty-two fabricated views.</p>
<p>“The four kinds of herbs should be seen as (1) the doorway of emptiness, (2) the doorway of the absence of attributes, (3) the doorway of the absence of aspiration, and (4) nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“The herbs are given in such and such a way so as to cure such and such an illness, and in that way through meditation on the doorways to liberation—emptiness, the absence of attributes, and the absence of aspiration—they bring an end to ignorance. Because of the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of formation, and so on until there is the cessation of the great mass of sheer suffering. And thus their minds neither dwell on virtue nor on sin.</p>
<p>“The born-blind man who gains sight should be seen as those who follow the Śrāvakayāna and the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna. They cut through the bondage of saṃsāra’s kleśas. Freed from the bondage of the kleśas, they are liberated from the six existences of the three realms. Therefore, those following the Śrāvakayāna think and say, ‘There is no other Dharma for attaining complete buddhahood and I have attained nirvāṇa.’ Then the Tathāgata teaches them the Dharma, saying, ‘How can one who has not attained the entire Dharma have nirvāṇa?’ and he then leads them to the attainment of enlightenment. Having gained realization they see the world of the three realms in the ten directions as empty, like an emanation, like an illusion, like a dream, a mirage, and an echo. They see that all phenomena are unborn and unceasing, without bondage or liberation, without darkness and without light.</p>
<p>“The ones who thus see and hear these profound dharmas see, without seeing, the different thoughts and aspirations of beings that fill the entire three realms.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān, teaching this in greater detail, recited these verses:</p>
<p>“The light of the sun and moon</p>
<p>Shines equally upon humans,</p>
<p>Both those with qualities and the sinful,</p>
<p>Without increase or diminution. {45}</p>
<p>“The wisdom light of the Tathāgata</p>
<p>Shines equally like the sun and moon,</p>
<p>And it guides all beings</p>
<p>Without diminution or excess. {46}</p>
<p>“A potter makes clay pots</p>
<p>Equally from the same clay</p>
<p>But they become pots</p>
<p>For molasses, milk, ghee, or water. {47}</p>
<p>“Some are for impurities</p>
<p>And others for curds,</p>
<p>Though the potter makes the pots</p>
<p>By using the same clay. {48}</p>
<p>“A pot is characterized in accordance</p>
<p>With the substance that is contained within it.</p>
<p>In the same way there is no difference between beings</p>
<p>But there are those who become tathāgatas because of their aspirations. {49}</p>
<p>“They describe separate yānas</p>
<p>But the Buddhayāna is the definitive one.</p>
<p>If there is no knowledge of the circle of saṃsāra</p>
<p>There can be no knowledge of nirvāṇa. {50}</p>
<p>“The one who knows emptiness</p>
<p>And that phenomena are without self</p>
<p>Truly knows the enlightenment</p>
<p>Of the bhagavāns, of the buddhas. {51}</p>
<p>“Someone who is classified as having</p>
<p>Medium wisdom is said to be a pratyekajina.</p>
<p>Someone who is lacking the knowledge of emptiness</p>
<p>Is proclaimed to be a śrāvaka. {52}</p>
<p>“The one who comprehends all phenomena</p>
<p>Is said to be a perfectly enlightened buddha. {53}</p>
<p>“Someone who is born blind says,</p>
<p>Not having ever seen</p>
<p>The sun, moon, planets, or stars,</p>
<p>‘There are no forms whatsoever.’ {54}</p>
<p>“A great physician has great compassion</p>
<p>For the one who is born blind,</p>
<p>And goes to the Himalayas,</p>
<p>Ascending, descending, and traversing them. {55}</p>
<p>“From the mountains he finds herbs</p>
<p>Of four kinds such as the one called</p>
<p>Endowed with all colors and tastes,</p>
<p>And he blends them together. {56}</p>
<p>“Some he grinds with his teeth,</p>
<p>And others he crushes, or moreover</p>
<p>Inserts them into a limb with a needle’s point,</p>
<p>Thereby using them on the born-blind man. {57}</p>
<p>“The blind man gains his sight and sees the sun,</p>
<p>The moon, the planets, and the stars,</p>
<p>And then he thinks that in the past</p>
<p>He had spoken out of ignorance. {58}</p>
<p>“In that way, beings have great ignorance</p>
<p>Like the born-blind man, and continue in saṃsāra.</p>
<p>Because they do not know the cycle of dependent origination</p>
<p>Their path is the river of suffering. {59}</p>
<p>“The supreme all-knowing one,</p>
<p>The Tathāgata, the great physician,</p>
<p>Who has the nature of compassion,</p>
<p>Appears in the world that is stupefied by ignorance. {60}</p>
<p>“That Teacher, skillful in methods,</p>
<p>Teaches the good Dharma.</p>
<p>To those in the highest yāna he teaches</p>
<p>The supreme enlightenment of buddhahood. {61}</p>
<p>“The Guide expounds the medium</p>
<p>To those who have medium wisdom,</p>
<p>And also describes another enlightenment</p>
<p>To those who are frightened of saṃsāra. {62}</p>
<p>“Śrāvakas who have freed themselves</p>
<p>From the three realms understand in this way:</p>
<p>‘I have gained the attainment</p>
<p>Of peace, of stainless nirvāṇa. {63}</p>
<p>“ ‘I have understood the entire Dharma</p>
<p>And thereby attained immortal nirvāṇa.’ {64}</p>
<p>“Then the great rishis have</p>
<p>Great compassion for the once-blind man,</p>
<p>And they say, ‘You are a fool!</p>
<p>Do not think, “I am wise!” {65}</p>
<p>“ ‘When you are staying</p>
<p>In the interior of a house,</p>
<p>You, who are an ignoramus,</p>
<p>Do not know what is outside. {66}</p>
<p>“ ‘How can you, ignoramus, say you have knowledge</p>
<p>When still, while you are inside,</p>
<p>You do not know what is done</p>
<p>Or not done on the outside? {67}</p>
<p>“ ‘You are not even able to hear</p>
<p>The sounds that are made</p>
<p>Merely five yojanas distant,</p>
<p>Let alone any further. {68}</p>
<p>“ ‘You are not able to know</p>
<p>What malicious thoughts others have</p>
<p>Or what kind thoughts they have,</p>
<p>So how can you be proud? {69}</p>
<p>“ ‘You are not able to go even one krośa</p>
<p>Without having to take a step.</p>
<p>You have immediately forgotten</p>
<p>Whatever happened in your mother’s womb. {70}</p>
<p>“ ‘Someone who is called omniscient</p>
<p>Is someone who has the five higher knowledges.</p>
<p>You are stupid and know nothing,</p>
<p>And yet you say, “I am omniscient.” {71}</p>
<p>“ ‘If you wish to be omniscient,</p>
<p>You must attain higher knowledge.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish higher knowledge</p>
<p>You must contemplate in solitude</p>
<p>The pure Dharma, and then through that</p>
<p>You will accomplish higher knowledge.’ {72}</p>
<p>“Having that as his goal he enters solitude</p>
<p>And contemplates with perfect concentration.</p>
<p>He attains the five higher knowledges,</p>
<p>And soon possesses those qualities. {73}</p>
<p>“In that way, all the śrāvakas</p>
<p>Believe they have attained nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>The Jina teaches to them,</p>
<p>‘This is not nirvāṇa, it is a rest. {74}</p>
<p>“ ‘This way of teaching</p>
<p>Is the method of the buddhas.</p>
<p>There is no other nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Than omniscience—strive to attain it! {75}</p>
<p>“ ‘The infinite wisdom of the three times,</p>
<p>And the excellent six perfections;</p>
<p>Emptiness, the absence of attributes,</p>
<p>And the elimination of aspiration; {76}</p>
<p>“ ‘The aspiration to enlightenment,</p>
<p>And the other dharmas that lead to nirvāṇa; {77}</p>
<p>“ ‘The four brahmavihāras, the methods of attracting disciples,</p>
<p>And whatever else has been taught,</p>
<p>Has been taught by the supreme rishis</p>
<p>For the purpose of guiding beings. {78}</p>
<p>“ ‘The one who knows that phenomena</p>
<p>Have the nature of dreams and illusions,</p>
<p>Are without an essence like a plantain tree</p>
<p>And are the same as echoes, {79}</p>
<p>“ ‘That one knows the nature</p>
<p>Of the entire three realms,</p>
<p>Has no bondage, is liberated,</p>
<p>And knows nirvāṇa. {80}</p>
<p>“ ‘All phenomena are empty and equal,</p>
<p>And their nature is without diversity or differentiation.</p>
<p>If that is not perceived,</p>
<p>There is no insight into any phenomenon. {81}</p>
<p>“ ‘The one with great wisdom sees</p>
<p>The entire dharmakāya.</p>
<p>There are no three yānas at all;</p>
<p>There is only the single yāna. {82}</p>
<p>“ ‘All phenomena are the same;</p>
<p>All are the same, always the same.</p>
<p>Knowing that, one knows</p>
<p>Nirvāṇa, deathlessness, and peace.’ ” {83}</p>
<p>This concludes “Herbs,” the fifth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Prophecies to the Śrāvakas</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>When the Bhagavān had finished reciting those verses, he announced to the complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Oh bhikṣus! I declare to you, I make it known to you, that this śrāvaka bhikṣu of mine, Kāśyapa, will serve three hundred billion buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. He will hold the Dharma of those buddha bhagavāns. In his last life, in an eon named Mahāvyūha, in a world named Avabhāsaprāptā, he will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Raśmiprabhāsa. His lifespan will be twelve intermediate eons. His Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons, and the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further twenty intermediate eons. His buddha realm will be pure and clean, without stones, pebbles, or gravel, without chasms or cliffs, without drains or cesspools. It will be flat, pleasant, beautiful, delightful, made of beryl, adorned by jewel trees, divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords, and filled with flowers. There will be many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas there. There will be countless hundred thousand quintillions of śrāvakas there. The evil Māra and his followers will not appear there. Even if Māra and Māra’s followers were to appear there they would become dedicated to maintaining the Dharma taught by the bhagavān tathāgata Raśmiprabhāsa.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, I see with my buddha’s eyes</p>
<p>That this sthavira, Kāśyapa, will become a buddha</p>
<p>In a future time, after countless eons</p>
<p>Of making offerings to supreme humans. {1}</p>
<p>“This Kāśyapa will see</p>
<p>A full three hundred billion jinas.</p>
<p>Bhikṣus, for the wisdom of buddhahood</p>
<p>He will practice celibacy during that time. {2}</p>
<p>“He will make offerings to those supreme humans</p>
<p>And will accomplish the highest wisdom.</p>
<p>In his last lifetime he will become</p>
<p>A lord of the world, an unequaled great rishi. {3}</p>
<p>“His realm will be most perfect,</p>
<p>Excellent, pure, and beautiful,</p>
<p>Pleasing in appearance, constantly delightful,</p>
<p>And adorned by cords of gold. {4}</p>
<p>“It will be divided like a checkerboard and in each square</p>
<p>There will be a variety of trees made of jewels</p>
<p>And the aroma of a spreading, pleasing incense</p>
<p>Will be in this realm, O bhikṣus. {5}</p>
<p>“It will be adorned by many flowers;</p>
<p>It will be beautified by a variety of flowers.</p>
<p>There will be no chasms or cliffs.</p>
<p>It will be flat, excellent, and beautiful. {6}</p>
<p>“There will be many billions of bodhisattvas there</p>
<p>With very disciplined minds and great miraculous powers.</p>
<p>There will be many thousands who will hold</p>
<p>The extensive sūtras of the Protector. {7}</p>
<p>“There will be śrāvakas of the Dharma King</p>
<p>Who are in their last lives, without defilements.</p>
<p>One could never be able to know their number</p>
<p>Even if one were to count with divine knowledge for eons. {8}</p>
<p>“He will live for twelve intermediate eons.</p>
<p>His Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons,</p>
<p>And the outer form of his Dharma for twenty intermediate eons.</p>
<p>It is thus that Raśmiprabhāsa will appear.” {9}</p>
<p>Then Brother Sthavira Mahā­maudgalyāyana, Brother Subhūti, and Brother Mahākātyāyana, with trembling bodies and unblinking eyes, stared at the Bhagavān, and all three of them in their minds recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Great hero, Arhat!</p>
<p>Śākya Lion! Supreme human!</p>
<p>Through your love for us</p>
<p>Speak the Buddha’s words. {10}</p>
<p>“Supreme human, knowing</p>
<p>That there is for us this definite opportunity,</p>
<p>Jina, sprinkle amrita upon us</p>
<p>And give to us a prophecy. {11}</p>
<p>“Just as when, during a famine,</p>
<p>Someone who finds good food</p>
<p>Shows what they have, and says,</p>
<p>‘I have found food!’ {12}</p>
<p>“Likewise, while contemplating the lower yāna</p>
<p>We are longing in that same way—</p>
<p>Like beings during a famine—</p>
<p>For the attainment of the Buddha’s wisdom. {13}</p>
<p>“The great Muni, the perfect Buddha,</p>
<p>Has not yet given us his prophecy.</p>
<p>This is like not being able to enjoy the food</p>
<p>That has been placed in our hands. {14}</p>
<p>“Hero, though we thus long</p>
<p>To hear your unsurpassable words,</p>
<p>When we have received the prophecy</p>
<p>Then we will have attained nirvāṇa. {15}</p>
<p>“Great hero, compassionate one</p>
<p>Whose wish is to bring benefit, give us the prophecy!</p>
<p>Great Muni, may there be an end</p>
<p>To the poverty of our minds.” {16}</p>
<p>At this, the Bhagavān, knowing in his own mind the thoughts that were in the minds of those great śrāvakas, those sthaviras, said to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, this great śrāvaka of mine, the sthavira Subhūti, will serve three hundred thousand million buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. And he will practice celibacy throughout that time and attain enlightenment. Having completed these activities, in his last life he will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Śaśiketu. His buddha realm will be named Ratnasaṃbhava. The eon will be named Ratnāvabhāsa. The realm will be level, delightful, made of crystal, adorned by jewel trees, without chasms or cliffs, without drains or cesspools, and filled with beautiful flowers. People will live within enjoyable kūṭāgāras. There will be many śrāvakas there. It will not be possible to know an end of counting them. There will be many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas there. The lifespan of that bhagavān will be twelve intermediate eons. His Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons, and the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further twenty intermediate eons. That bhagavān will be constantly teaching the Dharma while being suspended in midair, guiding many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas and hundreds of thousands of śrāvakas.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Listen to me, bhikṣus! I declare to you today,</p>
<p>And I make it known to you today</p>
<p>That this sthavira, Subhūti, my śrāvaka,</p>
<p>Will in a future time become a buddha. {17}</p>
<p>“He will see a full three hundred billion buddhas,</p>
<p>Those with great power,</p>
<p>And for the sake of the wisdom of buddhahood</p>
<p>He will practice appropriate conduct during that time. {18}</p>
<p>“In his last lifetime, this hero</p>
<p>Will have a body with the thirty-two signs.</p>
<p>He will be a great rishi like a golden pillar,</p>
<p>With compassion and benefit for the world. {19}</p>
<p>“His excellent realm will be beautiful,</p>
<p>Pleasant, and attractive for a multitude of beings.</p>
<p>He will live there as a friend for the world</p>
<p>And will liberate quintillions of beings. {20}</p>
<p>“There will be many bodhisattvas with great power</p>
<p>Who will turn the irreversible wheel.</p>
<p>They will have sharp faculties in the Jina’s teachings</p>
<p>And will be beautifying that buddha realm. {21}</p>
<p>“He will have many, countless śrāvakas,</p>
<p>Whose number will be beyond measure,</p>
<p>With the six higher knowledges, the three insights, great miracles,</p>
<p>And established in the eight liberations. {22}</p>
<p>“He will have inconceivable miraculous powers</p>
<p>And he will teach this highest enlightenment.</p>
<p>Devas and humans as numerous as the Ganges sands</p>
<p>Will constantly place their hands together in homage to him. {23}</p>
<p>“He will remain for twelve intermediate eons.</p>
<p>His Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons.</p>
<p>The outer form of the supreme human’s Dharma</p>
<p>Will remain for another twenty intermediate eons.” {24}</p>
<p>Next, the Bhagavān said to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, I declare to you, I make it known to you, that this śrāvaka of mine, the sthavira Mahākātyāyana, will serve eighty thousand million buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. When those tathāgatas have passed into nirvāṇa, he will make stūpas for those tathāgatas. They will be made of the seven precious materials, which are gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, emerald, and white coral. They will be a thousand yojanas in height and five hundred yojanas in circumference. He will make offerings to those stūpas of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, parasols, banners, flags, and banners of victory. Moreover, beyond that and further beyond, he will serve in that way two hundred million buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. Then in his last life he will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Jāmbūnada­prabhāsa. His buddha realm will be completely pure, level, delightful, attractive, beautiful, made of crystal, adorned by jewel trees, divided by cords of gold, and filled with beautiful flowers. There will be no hells, animals, realm of Yama, or asura realm. It will be filled there with many devas and humans, beautified by many hundred thousands of śrāvakas, and adorned by many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas. The lifespan of that bhagavān will be twelve intermediate eons. His Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons, and the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further twenty intermediate eons.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, all of you listen to me today,</p>
<p>To these infallible words that I speak.</p>
<p>This śrāvaka of mine, sthavira Kātyāyana,</p>
<p>Will make offerings to the guides. {25}</p>
<p>“When the guides of the world pass into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>He will create many stūpas for them.</p>
<p>He will honor them in many ways</p>
<p>And make offerings to them of incense and flowers. {26}</p>
<p>“When he has attained his last lifetime</p>
<p>He will become a jina in a completely pure realm.</p>
<p>He will completely perfect this wisdom</p>
<p>And will teach ten thousand million beings. {27}</p>
<p>“He will be honored by the world and its devas.</p>
<p>He will be a powerful, illuminating buddha.</p>
<p>His name will be Jāmbūnadābhāsa,</p>
<p>And he will liberate millions of devas and humans. {28}</p>
<p>“In that realm there will be innumerable,</p>
<p>Countless multitudes of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.</p>
<p>They will all eliminate becoming and ceasing,</p>
<p>And beautify the teaching of the Buddha.” {29}</p>
<p>Lastly, the Bhagavān said to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, I declare to you, I make it known to you, that this śrāvaka of mine, the sthavira Mahā­maudgalyāyana, will serve twenty-eight thousand buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. When those tathāgatas have passed into nirvāṇa, he will make stūpas for those tathāgatas. They will be made of the seven precious materials, which are gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, emerald, and white coral. They will be a thousand yojanas in height and five hundred yojanas in circumference. He will make offerings to those stūpas of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, parasols, banners, flags, and banners of victory. Moreover, beyond that and further beyond, he will serve in that way two million quintillion buddhas, will venerate them, honor them, make offerings to them, praise them, and respect them. Then in his last life, he will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Tamāla­patra­candana­gandha. His buddha realm will be named Manobhirāma. The name of the eon will be Ratiprapūrṇa. His buddha realm will be completely pure, level, delightful, attractive, beautiful, made of crystal, adorned by jewel trees, strewn with flower petals, and filled with many devas and humans. Hundreds of thousands of rishis will dwell there, who are śrāvakas and bodhisattvas. His lifespan will be twenty-four intermediate eons. His Dharma will remain for forty intermediate eons, and the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further forty intermediate eons.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“This my śrāvaka, Maudgalyagotra,</p>
<p>Having departed from this human body,</p>
<p>Will see twenty thousand jinas, protectors,</p>
<p>And moreover another eight thousand. {30}</p>
<p>“He will during that time practice celibacy,</p>
<p>Seeking this wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>He will in that time serve in many ways</p>
<p>Those guides, those supreme humans. {31}</p>
<p>“For a thousand million eons he will hold</p>
<p>The stainless Dharma they have taught.</p>
<p>When those sugatas have passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>He will make offerings to their stūpas. {32}</p>
<p>“He will make beautiful stūpas of precious materials</p>
<p>Together with victory banners for those supreme jinas.</p>
<p>He will offer flowers, incense, and music</p>
<p>To those compassionate benefiters of the world. {33}</p>
<p>“Then when he is in his last lifetime,</p>
<p>In a realm that is beautiful and delightful,</p>
<p>He will become a compassionate benefiter of the world</p>
<p>Who has the name Tamāla­patra­candana­gandha. {34}</p>
<p>“The lifespan of that sugata will be</p>
<p>A full twenty thousand intermediate eons.</p>
<p>He will constantly be giving the teaching</p>
<p>Of this way to buddhahood to humans and devas. {35}</p>
<p>“Then there will be many śrāvakas of that jina,</p>
<p>As numerous as the sands of ten billion Ganges,</p>
<p>Who in the teaching of that sugata will attain</p>
<p>The six higher knowledges, the three insights, and great miracles. {36}</p>
<p>“There will be many irreversible bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Many thousands of them there</p>
<p>Who will mindfully engage in diligence</p>
<p>And be dedicated to the teaching of that sugata. {37}</p>
<p>“Even when that jina has passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>His Dharma will remain during the time</p>
<p>Of a full forty intermediate eons</p>
<p>And its outer form will remain for the same length of time. {38}</p>
<p>“These five śrāvakas of mine with great miraculous powers,</p>
<p>Whose highest enlightenment I have prophesied,</p>
<p>Will in a future time be self-arisen jinas,</p>
<p>So their conduct you should hear from me.” {39}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Prophecies to the Śrāvakas,” the sixth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Past</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the past, in a time gone by, beyond and even further beyond the most countless, innumerable, incalculable, unquantifiable, inconceivable asaṃkhyeya eons ago, at that time, in that era, in an eon named Mahārūpa, in a world named Saṃbhavā, there appeared in that world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, how long has it been since that tathāgata appeared? Bhikṣus, it is like this: A man crushes all the earth of the worlds in this realm of a billion worlds into powder. Then that man takes a single smallest particle of dust from those worlds and goes beyond a thousand worlds in the eastern direction and puts it down. Then that man takes a second smallest particle of dust, and passing beyond an even further thousand worlds puts down that second smallest particle of dust. In that way the man removes the entire element of earth into the eastern direction.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, what do you think? Is it possible to calculate the end, the furthest extent of those worlds?”</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, it’s impossible.” they answered. “Sugata, it’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus,” continued the Bhagavān, “a mathematician, a great mathematician could calculate the number of the worlds in which particles were placed and the number of those in which a particle was not placed. However, they could not through their enumeration know the number of the hundred thousands of quintillion of eons that have passed since the bhagavān tathāgata Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, there has been such an inconceivable, such an immeasurable length of time since that tathāgata passed into nirvāṇa, but through possessing the power of the vision of a tathāgata’s wisdom, I remember that nirvāṇa as if it were yesterday or today.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“I remember that many eons ago in the past,</p>
<p>At that time there was a supreme human,</p>
<p>A great muni named Abhi­jñā­jñānābhi­bhū,</p>
<p>A supreme jina who appeared in the world. {1}</p>
<p>“If someone were to make into the smallest particles of dust</p>
<p>All the worlds in a realm of a billion worlds,</p>
<p>And were to take from there a single smallest particle,</p>
<p>And having traversed a thousand worlds put it down, {2}</p>
<p>“And then were they similarly to deposit a second and a third,</p>
<p>And were they to move all the dust in that way</p>
<p>So that this world realm would become vacant</p>
<p>And all that dust would have been taken away, {3}</p>
<p>“Those smallest particles of dust</p>
<p>In those worlds would be uncountable.</p>
<p>If all those dust particles that had been created</p>
<p>Were each to represent a hundred eons, {4}</p>
<p>“Even the many countless millions of eons</p>
<p>That all those dust particles represent</p>
<p>Could not convey how many eons have come to an end</p>
<p>Since that sugata passed into nirvāṇa. {5}</p>
<p>“That is how long since that guide’s nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And since his śrāvakas and bodhisattvas thrived.</p>
<p>I remember, through the wisdom of the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>Exactly what occurred as if it were today or yesterday. {6}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, such is my wisdom,</p>
<p>The limitless wisdom of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>With my subtle and immaculate memory</p>
<p>I know many hundreds of eons. {7}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the lifespan of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū was fifty-four hundred thousand quintillion eons. Before that bhagavān attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, he went to the sublime, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa. He conquered and defeated the entire army of Māra. Having defeated and conquered it, he thought, ‘I shall attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’</p>
<p>“While those qualities had not yet manifested, he sat on the Bodhimaṇḍa at the foot of the Bodhi tree for an entire intermediate eon. He sat there for a second intermediate eon but still did not attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. During a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, an eighth, a ninth, and a tenth intermediate eon he sat on the Bodhimaṇḍa at the foot of the Bodhi tree, with legs always crossed, never standing up, with his mind unwavering and his body motionless, but even so, during that time those qualities did not manifest for him.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the devas of Trāyastriṃśa erected for that bhagavān, who had come to the sublime, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, a great lion throne, which was five hundred yojanas high, for the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. As soon as that bhagavān sat on the Bodhimaṇḍa, the Brahmakāyika devas sent down a rain of flowers up to ten yojanas around the Bodhimaṇḍa, and from the sky a breeze would come that removed all the withering flowers. In that way a rain of flowers fell and fell continuously on the Bhagavān sitting on the Bodhimaṇḍa. They fell on that bhagavān throughout the entire ten intermediate eons. That rainfall of flowers continued to fall until the nirvāṇa of that bhagavān, being tossed down upon that bhagavān.</p>
<p>“The devas of the paradises of the four mahārājas, in order to honor the Bhagavān seated at the sublime, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, played the divine drums of paradise and played them throughout the entire ten intermediate eons. The delightful divine music continued until the time of the great nirvāṇa of the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, after ten intermediate eons had passed, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. When the Bhagavān was young he had had sixteen sons of his own, and they immediately knew that he had attained buddhahood. The eldest of those sons was named Jñānākara.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, each of these sixteen young princes enjoyed delightful, captivating, and beautiful amusements of many kinds.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when the sixteen young princes knew that the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū had attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, they abandoned their many different kinds of delightful amusements and, encircled and accompanied by their weeping mothers and wet nurses, and encircled and accompanied by their grandfather, who was the cakravartin king Mahākośa, the king’s ministers, and many hundred thousands of quintillions of beings, they went to the Bodhimaṇḍa where the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū was seated, in order to serve him, venerate him, honor him, make offerings to him, praise him, and respect him.</p>
<p>“When they arrived there, they bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān three times, and with hands together in homage, in front of the Bhagavān they fittingly praised him with these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘You have the six great higher knowledges, you are unsurpassable,</p>
<p>And you have perfected yourself for endless eons,</p>
<p>In order to bring liberation to all beings.</p>
<p>You have fulfilled here your excellent intention. {8}</p>
<p>“ ‘You have endured hardship for ten intermediate eons,</p>
<p>Practicing being seated upon one seat.</p>
<p>You have never moved your body,</p>
<p>Hands, or feet, or gone anywhere. {9}</p>
<p>“ ‘Your mind is at peace and perfectly stilled,</p>
<p>You are never agitated or disturbed,</p>
<p>You never have any distraction,</p>
<p>You remain in perfect, immaculate peace. {10}</p>
<p>“ ‘You have attained this supreme enlightenment</p>
<p>Through goodness, bliss, happiness, and harmlessness.</p>
<p>In that way, this is our good fortune;</p>
<p>Lord of Men, Lion, we increase our virtue. {11}</p>
<p>“ ‘All these suffering beings have no protector;</p>
<p>Their eyes gouged out, they are deprived of happiness.</p>
<p>They do not know the path that will end suffering,</p>
<p>And do not have the diligence to attain liberation. {12}</p>
<p>“ ‘For a long time they have been increasing lower existences,</p>
<p>And factors depriving them of divine rebirths.</p>
<p>They never hear the words of the Jina</p>
<p>And the entire world is in the darkness of ignorance. {13}</p>
<p>“ ‘Knower of the World, you have attained today</p>
<p>The state of sublime, immaculate peace.</p>
<p>We and the world are in your care.</p>
<p>Protector, we go to you for refuge.’ {14}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those sixteen children, young princes, with these verses fittingly praised the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū. They then said, ‘Bhagavān, we request you to teach the Dharma for the benefit and welfare of devas and humans and of the great multitudes of beings. Sugata, we request you to teach the Dharma!’ They thus requested the bhagavān to turn the wheel of the Dharma, and they made a further request through these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘You with the signs of a hundred merits,</p>
<p>Unequaled guide, great rishi, teach the Dharma!</p>
<p>You have attained the superior, highest wisdom.</p>
<p>Teach it to this world and its devas— {15}</p>
<p>“ ‘Liberate us and these beings!</p>
<p>Teach the wisdom of the tathāgatas</p>
<p>So that we and these beings</p>
<p>Will attain this highest enlightenment. {16}</p>
<p>“ ‘You fully comprehend conduct and wisdom;</p>
<p>You know previous motivations and merit</p>
<p>And the aspirations of all beings.</p>
<p>Turn the supreme, unsurpassable wheel!’ {17}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when the bhagavān , the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in each of the ten directions shook and were filled with a great light. There were in all those worlds the unfortunate existences in between worlds where there was complete darkness. The moon and sun with their great miraculous power, their great might, and their great brilliance could not with their light illuminate them. They could not with their color bring color there or with their brilliance bring brilliance. The great light appeared even in those places. The beings who had been reborn between the worlds saw each other and knew that each other were there and they said, ‘Oh my! There are other beings who have been born here! Oh my! There are other beings who have been born here!’</p>
<p>“In all those worlds the paradises and heavenly residences shook in six ways, even as far up as the paradise of Brahmā, and were filled with a great light, which transcended the divine power of the devas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in that way, at that time, those worlds shook and were filled by a great light.</p>
<p>“The airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the east became very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those Brahmās wondered, ‘These airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic. Who is this a sign of?’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds came to each other’s homes and spoke with each other.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmā named Sarva­sattva­trātā spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās:</p>
<p>“ ‘Today we are all very happy.</p>
<p>These excellent airborne palaces are shining,</p>
<p>Glorious, bright, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Why has this happened today? {18}</p>
<p>“ ‘It will be good to find its meaning.</p>
<p>What deva’s son has been born today?</p>
<p>Through whose power has there appeared</p>
<p>Today this kind of unprecedented event? {19}</p>
<p>“ ‘Perhaps a buddha, a king who is lord of humans,</p>
<p>Has appeared in some world today</p>
<p>And, as a sign of that, these splendors</p>
<p>Have shone in the ten directions today.’ {20}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered together each entered his own divine Brahmā palace and, holding a basket of divine flowers that was the size of Sumeru, flew in their airborne palaces into the four directions.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when they went to the west those Mahābrahmās saw in the west the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, who had come to the sublime, highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Before him were assembled devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, who were gazing upon him, and the sixteen young princes, who were requesting him to turn the wheel of the Dharma. When they saw that, they approached the Bhagavān, and bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān many hundreds of thousands of times, and upon the Bhagavān they tossed and scattered flowers from their baskets the size of Sumeru. They strewed flowers up to a distance of ten yojanas from the Bodhi tree. They offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the Bhagavān, saying, ‘Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, accept these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Sugata, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those Mahābrahmās each offered to the Bhagavān their own airborne palace, and at that time, in the presence of the Bhagavān, they fittingly praised him with these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘You, the inconceivable, wonderful Jina,</p>
<p>Compassionate, helper of the world, have appeared.</p>
<p>You have been born as Lord, Teacher, and Guru,</p>
<p>And today have taken the ten directions into your care. {21}</p>
<p>“ ‘We have come from a total of</p>
<p>Fifty quintillion worlds.</p>
<p>We have come to pay homage to the Jina</p>
<p>And have given up our excellent airborne palaces. {22}</p>
<p>“ ‘Through the karma we created in the past</p>
<p>We have these brilliant, beautiful airborne palaces.</p>
<p>Accept them out of compassion for us.</p>
<p>Knower of the world, enjoy them in whatever way you wish.’ {23}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās in the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū fittingly praised him with those verses, and then said to the Bhagavān, ‘Bhagavān, turn the wheel of the Dharma in the world! Bhagavān, teach nirvāṇa! Bhagavān, liberate beings! Bhagavān, take this world into your care!</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhagavān, teach the Dharma to the world including its devas, māras, and brahmakas, to beings including mendicants and brahmins, and to the devas, asuras, and humans. Then there will be benefit for many beings, happiness for many beings, compassion for the world, and welfare, benefit, and happiness for a great multitude of beings, devas, and humans.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those fifty hundred thousand quintillion Mahābrahmās, speaking as one voice, recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhagavān, teach the Dharma!</p>
<p>Supreme human, teach!</p>
<p>With the power of kindness, teach!</p>
<p>Free beings from suffering! {24}</p>
<p>“ ‘The Lamp of the World is difficult to find,</p>
<p>Like the flower of a fig tree.</p>
<p>Great hero, you have appeared.</p>
<p>Tathāgata, we supplicate you.’ {25}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Bhagavān gave his assent by saying nothing to the Mahābrahmās.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time the airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the southeast became very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those Brahmās wondered, ‘These airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic. Who is this a sign of?’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds came to each other’s homes and spoke with each other.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmā named Adhi­mātra­kāruṇika spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās:</p>
<p>“ ‘Friends, whose omen is this</p>
<p>That has appeared on this day?</p>
<p>Today our airborne palaces are beautified. {26}</p>
<p>“ ‘Has there come here today</p>
<p>A deva who is endowed with merit?</p>
<p>Is it through his power</p>
<p>That all these airborne palaces have been beautified? {27}</p>
<p>“ ‘Or has a buddha, a supreme human</p>
<p>Appeared in this world</p>
<p>And through his power</p>
<p>Our palaces have become like this? {28}</p>
<p>“ ‘We should all search together.</p>
<p>This is not something of little importance.</p>
<p>I have never before</p>
<p>Seen an omen such as this. {29}</p>
<p>“ ‘We should go into the four directions</p>
<p>And travel through millions of realms.</p>
<p>Clearly in this world today</p>
<p>There will be the appearance of a buddha.’ {30}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered together each entered his own divine Brahmā palace and, holding a basket of divine flowers that was the size of Sumeru, flew in their airborne palaces into the four directions.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when they went into the west those Mahābrahmās saw in the west the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, who had come to the sublime, highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Before him were assembled devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, who were gazing upon him, and the sixteen young princes, who were requesting him to turn the wheel of the Dharma. When they saw that, they came to the Bhagavān, and bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān many hundreds of thousands of times, and upon the Bhagavān they threw and scattered flowers from the baskets the size of Sumeru. They strewed flowers up to a distance of ten yojanas from the Bodhi tree.</p>
<p>“They offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the bhagavān, saying, ‘Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, accept these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Sugata, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those Mahābrahmās each offered to the Bhagavān their own airborne palace, and at that time, in the presence of the Bhagavān they fittingly praised him with these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Homage to you, the unequaled great rishi.</p>
<p>Deity above deities, with the voice of an avadavat,</p>
<p>Guide of the World and its devas,</p>
<p>We praise you who benefits and is kind to the world. {31}</p>
<p>“ ‘Lord, it is wondrous that after a long time,</p>
<p>You have somehow appeared in the world today.</p>
<p>A full eight thousand eons in this world of beings</p>
<p>Has been devoid of buddhas. {32}</p>
<p>“ ‘An entire eight thousand eons</p>
<p>Has been devoid of a supreme human.</p>
<p>During that time the lower existences have multiplied</p>
<p>And rebirths as devas have diminished. {33}</p>
<p>“ ‘Now, through our merit, there has appeared in the world</p>
<p>The compassionate helper, the King of Dharma.</p>
<p>He is our eyes, our recourse, and refuge,</p>
<p>Our protector, father, and likewise, friend.’ {34}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās in the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū fittingly praised him with those verses, and then said to the Bhagavān, ‘Bhagavān, turn the wheel of the Dharma in the world! Bhagavān, teach nirvāṇa! Bhagavān, liberate beings! Bhagavān, take this world into your care!</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhagavān, teach the Dharma to the world including its devas, māras, and brahmakas, to beings including mendicants and brahmins, and to the devas, asuras, and humans. Then there will be benefit for many beings, happiness for many beings, compassion for the world, and welfare, benefit, and happiness for a great multitude of beings, devas, and humans.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those fifty hundred thousand quintillion Mahābrahmās, speaking as one voice, recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“ ‘Great Muni, turn the wheel of the Dharma!</p>
<p>Teach the Dharma in the ten directions!</p>
<p>Liberate beings tormented by the phenomena of suffering!</p>
<p>Bring joy and happiness to beings! {35}</p>
<p>“ ‘Through hearing that, enlightenment will be attained.</p>
<p>They will go to the realm of the devas,</p>
<p>They will all avoid rebirth as an asura,</p>
<p>And be disciplined, peaceful, and completely happy.’ {36}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Bhagavān gave his assent by saying nothing to the Mahābrahmās.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time the airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the south became very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those Brahmās wondered, ‘These airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic. Who is this a sign of?’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds came to each other’s homes and spoke with each other.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmā named Sudharma spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās:</p>
<p>“ ‘Friends, for no reason, with no cause,</p>
<p>All our airborne palaces are shining.</p>
<p>This is some sign that has appeared in this world.</p>
<p>We must seek well for the meaning of this. {37}</p>
<p>“ ‘No fewer than hundreds of eons have passed</p>
<p>Without such a sign having ever appeared.</p>
<p>Either a deva has been born here</p>
<p>Or a buddha has appeared in this world.’ {38}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered together each entered his own divine Brahmā palace and, holding a basket of divine flowers that was the size of Sumeru, flew in their airborne palaces into the four directions.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when they went into the west those Mahābrahmās saw in the west the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū who had come to the sublime, highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Before him were assembled devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans who were gazing upon him, and the sixteen young princes, who were requesting him to turn the wheel of the Dharma. When they saw that they came to the Bhagavān, and bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān many hundreds of thousands of times, and upon the Bhagavān they tossed and scattered flowers from their baskets the size of Sumeru. They strewed flowers up to a distance of ten yojanas from the Bodhi tree. They offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the Bhagavān, saying, ‘Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, accept these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Sugata, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those Mahābrahmās each offered to the Bhagavān their own airborne palace, and at that time, in the presence of the Bhagavān, they fittingly praised him with these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘It is difficult to see the guides.</p>
<p>You have arrived well and have defeated existence’s desires.</p>
<p>After a very long time you are seen today.</p>
<p>After a full hundred eons you have appeared. {39}</p>
<p>“ ‘Lord of the World, quench the thirst of beings.</p>
<p>Never seen before, you have somehow appeared.</p>
<p>Just as the fig tree flower is rarely found,</p>
<p>In that way, Guide, you have been seen. {40}</p>
<p>“ ‘Guide, these airborne palaces of ours</p>
<p>Today were beautified through your power.</p>
<p>You who see all, please accept them,</p>
<p>And enjoy them out of compassion for us.’ {41}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās in the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū fittingly praised him with those verses, and then said to the Bhagavān, ‘Bhagavān, turn the wheel of the Dharma in the world! Bhagavān, teach nirvāṇa! Bhagavān, liberate beings! Bhagavān, take this world into your care!</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhagavān, teach the Dharma to the world, including its devas, māras, and brahmakas, to beings including mendicants and brahmins, and to the devas, asuras, and humans. Then there will be benefit for many beings, happiness for many beings, compassion for the world, and welfare, benefit, and happiness for a great multitude of beings, devas, and humans.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those fifty hundred thousand quintillion Mahābrahmās, speaking as one voice, recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“ ‘Guide, Bhagavān, teach the Dharma!</p>
<p>Turn the wheel of the Dharma!</p>
<p>Beat the drum of the Dharma!</p>
<p>Blow the conch of the Dharma! {42}</p>
<p>“ ‘Send down the rain of the Dharma onto the world!</p>
<p>Teach perfectly with your beautiful voice!</p>
<p>Teach the Dharma as we request,</p>
<p>And liberate quintillions of beings!’ {43}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Bhagavān gave his assent by saying nothing to the Mahābrahmās.</p>
<p>“The same occurred in the southwest, the same in the west, the same in the northwest, the same in the north, the same in the northeast, and in the downward direction.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time the airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the upward direction became very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those Brahmās wondered, ‘These airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful, bright, radiant, glorious, and majestic. Who is this a sign of?’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds came to each other’s homes and spoke with each other.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmā named Śikhin spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās:</p>
<p>“ ‘Friends, what is the reason why this has occurred?</p>
<p>Why have the airborne palaces become brilliant?</p>
<p>Their majesty, color, and brightness</p>
<p>Have exceptionally increased for what reason? {44}</p>
<p>“ ‘We have never seen such a thing as this before.</p>
<p>No one has ever heard of such a thing before.</p>
<p>Today this place has been filled by this light.</p>
<p>What is the cause for this extreme beauty? {45}</p>
<p>“ ‘Perhaps some deva has appeared here</p>
<p>Who is endowed with good karma,</p>
<p>And what has occurred is because of his power.</p>
<p>Or there is the rare appearance of a buddha in this world.’ {46}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered together each entered his own divine Brahmā palace and, holding a basket of divine flowers that was the size of Sumeru, flew in their airborne palaces into the four directions.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when they went into the west those Mahābrahmās saw in the west the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, who had come to the sublime, highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Before him were assembled devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, who were gazing upon him, and the sixteen young princes, who were requesting him to turn the wheel of the Dharma. When they saw that, they came to the Bhagavān, and bowed their heads to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān many hundreds of thousands of times, and upon the Bhagavān they threw and scattered flowers from the baskets the size of Sumeru. They strewed flowers up to a distance of ten yojanas from the Bodhi tree. They offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the Bhagavān, saying ‘Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, accept these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Bhagavān, for the sake of showing compassion to us, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās. Sugata, enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmās.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, then those Mahābrahmās each offered to the Bhagavān their own airborne palace, and at that time, in the presence of the Bhagavān they fittingly praised him with these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘It is excellent to see the buddhas,</p>
<p>The lords of the worlds, the protectors,</p>
<p>The buddhas who in these three realms</p>
<p>Liberate beings from their bondage. {47}</p>
<p>“ ‘The all-seeing lords of the worlds</p>
<p>See into the ten directions.</p>
<p>They open the door to deathlessness</p>
<p>And liberate many beings. {48}</p>
<p>“ ‘In the past there have been</p>
<p>Countless empty eons.</p>
<p>The lords of jinas were not seen</p>
<p>And the ten directions were blind. {49}</p>
<p>“ ‘There was an increase in the dreadful hells,</p>
<p>And among the asuras and the animals.</p>
<p>Thousands of millions of beings</p>
<p>Took rebirth among the pretas. {50}</p>
<p>“ ‘There was a diminution of rebirths as devas,</p>
<p>And at death beings went to the lower existences.</p>
<p>The Dharma of the buddhas was not heard</p>
<p>And these existences were sinful. {51}</p>
<p>“ ‘There was a diminution among all beings</p>
<p>Of the wisdom of the way of pure conduct.</p>
<p>Their happiness was destroyed</p>
<p>And the concept of happiness was lost. {52}</p>
<p>“ ‘They performed incorrect practices</p>
<p>And followed that which was not the Dharma.</p>
<p>They were not subdued by a lord of the world</p>
<p>And fell into the lower existences. {53}</p>
<p>“ ‘Lamp of the World, you are now seen.</p>
<p>After a long time, you have come.</p>
<p>You, compassionate one, have appeared here</p>
<p>For the sake of all beings. {54}</p>
<p>“ ‘You have joyfully and happily attained</p>
<p>The unsurpassable wisdom of the buddhas.</p>
<p>We rejoice in what you have attained,</p>
<p>As does the world and its devas. {55}</p>
<p>“ ‘Leader, it is through your power</p>
<p>That our airborne palaces have become magnificent.</p>
<p>Hero, we offer them to you.</p>
<p>Great Muni, accept them. {56}</p>
<p>“ ‘Guide, please enjoy them</p>
<p>Out of compassion for us.</p>
<p>And then we and all beings</p>
<p>Will reach the highest enlightenment.’ {57}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Mahābrahmās in the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū fittingly praised him with those verses, and then said to the Bhagavān, ‘Bhagavān, turn the wheel of the Dharma in the world! Bhagavān, teach nirvāṇa! Bhagavān, liberate beings! Bhagavān, take this world into your care!</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhagavān, teach the Dharma to the world including its devas, māras, and brahmakas, to beings including mendicants and brahmins, and to the devas, asuras, and humans. Then there will be a benefit for many beings, happiness for many beings, compassion for the world, and welfare, benefit, and happiness for a great multitude of beings, devas, and humans.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those fifty hundred thousand quintillion Mahābrahmās, speaking as one voice, now recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“ ‘Turn the highest, supreme wheel!</p>
<p>Beat the drum of deathlessness!</p>
<p>Liberate beings from the net of suffering!</p>
<p>Teach the path to nirvāṇa! {58}</p>
<p>“ ‘Teach the Dharma that we request!</p>
<p>Take us and this world into your care!</p>
<p>Speak with your beautiful voice</p>
<p>That has been accomplished through billions of eons!’ {59}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, thereupon the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, knowing what was requested by the many hundred thousand quintillions of Brahmās and the sixteen young princes, at that time, in accord with Dharma, turned the Dharma wheel that had never been turned by any mendicant, brahmin, deva, māra, or Brahmā in the world:</p>
<p>“ ‘This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the path that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ This was repeated three times so that there were twelve turnings of the Dharma wheel.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhikṣus, in this way, through the factor of ignorance there is formation. Through the factor of formation there is consciousness. Through the factor of consciousness there is name-and-form. Through the factor of name-and-form there are the six āyatanas. Through the factor of the six āyatanas there is contact. Through the factor of contact there is sensation. Through the factor of sensation there is craving. Through the factor of craving there is grasping. Through the factor of grasping there is becoming. Through the factor of becoming there is birth. Through the factor of birth there is old age, death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, and disturbance. In that way there arises a great mass of sheer suffering.</p>
<p>“ ‘Through the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of formation. Through the cessation of formation there is the cessation of consciousness. Through the cessation of consciousness there is the cessation of name-and-form. Through the cessation of name-and-form there is the cessation of the six āyatanas. Through the cessation of the six āyatanas there is the cessation of contact. Through the cessation of contact there is the cessation of sensation. Through the cessation of sensation there is the cessation of craving. Through the cessation of craving there is the cessation of grasping. Through the cessation of grasping there is the cessation of becoming. Through the cessation of becoming there is the cessation of birth. Through the cessation of birth there is the cessation of old age, death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, and disturbance. In that way there is the cessation of the great mass of unalloyed suffering.’ In that way he taught dependent origination extensively.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in that way the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū turned the Dharma wheel before the world with its devas, māras, and brahmakas, and before the assembly with its mendicants and brahmins.</p>
<p>“In that moment, in that instant, sixty hundred thousand quintillion beings became free of grasping and their minds were liberated from the defilements. They all became meditators possessed of the three insights, the six higher knowledges, and the eight liberations.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in conclusion, the Bhagavān taught the Dharma a second time, and then he taught the Dharma a third and a fourth time.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, each time the Bhagavān taught the Dharma, as many beings as there are grains of sand in a hundred thousand quintillion Ganges Rivers became free of grasping, and their minds were liberated from the defilements.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, after that, his śrāvaka saṅgha became innumerable.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time the sixteen young princes, having faith, together renounced home for homelessness. They all became mendicants who were wise, had clear minds, sharp minds, were learned, had practiced under hundreds of thousands of buddhas, and were dedicated to the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the sixteen mendicants said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, ‘Bhagavān, these many thousands of quintillions of the Tathāgata’s śrāvakas have through the Dharma teaching of the Bhagavān accomplished great miraculous abilities, great power, and great might. Bhagavān, that being so, out of compassion give us the teachings that commence with the highest, complete enlightenment, so that we also may be students of the Tathāgata. Bhagavān, our goal is to have the visions of the Tathāgata’s wisdom; Bhagavān, this is evident to you. Bhagavān you know the thoughts of all beings, and you know our thoughts.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon, bhikṣus, as soon as they saw that those princes, those young boys, had become renunciants and mendicants, half the retinue of the cakravartin, numbering eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion beings, themselves all became renunciants.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū knew the aspiration of those mendicants and, after twenty thousand eons had passed, he taught the fourfold assembly that instruction for bodhisattvas possessed by all the buddhas, the great extensive sūtra, the Dharma teaching entitled The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time the sixteen mendicants acquired, maintained, and understood that teaching of the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū then gave to the sixteen mendicants the prophecy of their complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, śrāvakas aspired to the teaching given by the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, and the sixteen mendicants and many hundred thousands of quintillions attained freedom from doubt.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū gave this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma uninterruptedly for a hundred thousand eons. He then entered the temple in order to be alone.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the tathāgata stayed alone in the temple in that way for eighty-four thousand eons.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the sixteen mendicants, knowing that the Bhagavān was staying in solitude, each set up a Dharma seat, a lion throne, sat upon it, and extensively taught for eighty-four thousand eons this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to the fourfold assembly.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, each mendicant bodhisattva taught as many hundred thousand quintillions of beings as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers. They inspired them, brought them joy, and made them retain it, and ripened them for the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñā­jñānābhi­bhū, after eighty-four thousand eons had passed, mindfully and knowingly arose from his samādhi. After the Bhagavān had arisen from his samādhi, he went to where his Dharma seat was. He came to the arranged seat and sat upon it.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, as soon as the Bhagavān sat on the Dharma seat, he looked upon the gathered assembly and addressed the saṇgha of bhikṣus: ‘Bhikṣus, these sixteen mendicants are amazing, wonderful, and wise; they have been honoring many hundred thousands of quintillions of buddhas, they have been perfectly practicing proper conduct, they have been encouraging beings to receive the wisdom of the buddhas, they have been introducing beings to the wisdom of the buddhas, and they have been teaching the wisdom of the buddhas. Bhikṣus, you must continue to honor these sixteen mendicants. Bhikṣus, those noble sons who follow the Śrāvakayāna, the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, or the Bodhisattva­yāna, who do not reject or malign the Dharma teaching, will all quickly attain the highest, complete enlightenment. They will all attain the wisdom of the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those sixteen noble sons taught again and again this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma within the teaching of that bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, each of those bodhisattvas, those sixteen mendicant bodhisattva mahāsattvas, guided to enlightenment as many hundred thousand quintillions of beings as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers. All those beings, in all their lifetimes, became renunciants with those sixteen, gazed upon them, and heard the Dharma from them. They served four hundred thousand million buddhas and some are still serving buddhas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, you should aspire to this and comprehend it. Those sixteen young princes who as youths were mendicants who taught the Dharma in the Bhagavān’s teaching all attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, and they are all now present, living, and remaining. In their separate buddha realms in the ten directions they are teaching the Dharma to many hundred thousand quintillions of śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, they are like this: In the eastern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Akṣobhya in the realm named Abhirati and there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Merukūṭa.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the southeastern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Siṃhaghoṣa and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Siṃhadhvaja.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the southern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Ākāśa­pratiṣṭhita and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Nitya­pari­nirvṛta.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the southwestern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Indradhvaja and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Brahmadhvaja.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the western direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Amitāyus and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Sarva­loka­dhātū­padra­vodvega­pratyuttīrṇa.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the northwestern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Tamāla­patra­candana­gandhābhijña and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Merukalpa.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the northern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Meghasvaradīpa and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Meghasvararāja.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the northeastern direction there is the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Sarva­loka­bhayacchambhita­tva­vidhvaṃsana­rakara and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Śākyamuni.</p>
<p>“Those sixteen attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in this central world realm named Sahā.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those beings who within the teaching of that bhagavān heard the Dharma from us when we were mendicants, from each of us bodhisattvas, those hundreds of thousands of beings as numerous as the sand grains in the Ganges River were guided by us toward the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, they still remain on the level of the śrāvakas but have been ripened for the highest, complete enlightenment. They will in the course of time attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. Why is that? Bhikṣus, it is because it is difficult to aspire to the wisdom of a tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, who are those countless hundred thousands of quintillions of beings, who are as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, whom I caused to hear the Dharma of omniscience when I was a bodhisattva in the teaching of that bhagavān? Bhikṣus, at that time, on that occasion, you were those beings.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the future times when I have passed into nirvāṇa, there will be śrāvakas who will hear of the practices of the bodhisattva, but they will not think, ‘We are bodhisattvas.’ They will all have the concept of nirvāṇa, and they will enter into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, however, I will be dwelling in other worlds under other names, and they will be reborn there, seeking the wisdom of the tathāgatas and they will hear, ‘There is only one nirvāṇa of the tathāgatas. There is no second nirvāṇa other than that.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, that practice of the teaching of the Dharma should be known to be the skillful method of the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, when a tathāgata sees that the time has come for his passing into nirvāṇa, he sees that his followers are pure, with deep dedication and realization of the Dharma of emptiness, and have acquired dhyāna and great dhyāna.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, a tathāgata, knowing the time has come, assembles all the bodhisattvas and all the śrāvakas, and then proclaims to them this meaning: ‘Bhikṣus, there is no second yāna or nirvāṇa in this world at all, let alone a third. Bhikṣus, that is the skillful method of the tathāgatas. Seeing that beings have been depraved for a long time, delight in the inferior, and are attached to desires, then, bhikṣus, the tathāgata teaches them nirvāṇa in accordance with their aspirations.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, it is like this: A group of beings, in order to go to an island of jewels, comes to a jungle that is five hundred yojanas wide. They have a single guide who is wise, bright, clever, intelligent, and has brought many travelers through that difficult jungle.</p>
<p>“That great group of beings becomes tired, exhausted, and frightened. They say, ‘O noble guide, we are tired, exhausted, frightened, and miserable. We are going to turn back. This jungle goes on too far.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the guide who has skill in methods, knowing that the people wish to turn back, thinks, ‘These distressed people must not fail to reach the great island of jewels!’ Then with compassion for them he employs a skillful method. He conjures up in the middle of the jungle a miraculous city that is more than a hundred yojanas, or two hundred yojanas in size. He says to those people, ‘Do not be afraid! Do not turn back! Rest in this great region! Here you may do whatever you wish! There you will rest and attain relief from misery. Then the one who has more to accomplish can go on to the great island of jewels.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those people who entered the jungle are astonished and think, ‘We are freed from the jungle. We will stay here where we have attained relief from misery.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, those people enter the miraculous city and believe they have arrived at their destination. They believe they have crossed through the jungle, and they believe they have gained tranquility and relief from misery. When the guide knows that they have rested, he causes the miraculous city to vanish.</p>
<p>“When it has vanished he says to them, ‘This great city was conjured up by me for you to rest in. We are close to the great island of jewels so you beings should go there.’</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha is the guide for you and all beings.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha sees that the great jungle of kleśas is to be left behind, departed from, and abandoned. But if these beings hear only of the wisdom of the buddhas they will be afraid and turn back, thinking, ‘The accomplishment of the wisdom of the buddhas involves many hardships!’ and they will not set out toward it.</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata knows the weakness of the aspirations of beings. Just as the guide conjured up a miraculous city for beings to rest in, and when they had rested told them that this was a miraculous city, in that way, bhikṣus, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha employs a great skillful method so that beings may rest. He describes and teaches two levels of intermediate nirvāṇas. Those are the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyeka­buddhas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, while the beings are dwelling on those levels, then, bhikṣus, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha says to them, ‘Bhikṣus, you have not done what needs to be done, you have not accomplished what needs to be accomplished! Bhikṣus, you are close to the wisdom of the Tathāgata. Look and see! Understand! That which is your nirvāṇa is not nirvāṇa. Bhikṣus, the three yānas that the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas teach are their skillful method.’ ”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān taught this in detail through verses:</p>
<p>“The guide of the world, Abhi­jñā­jñānābhi­bhū</p>
<p>Was seated upon the Bodhimaṇḍa.</p>
<p>For ten full intermediate eons,</p>
<p>He did not attain enlightenment—insight into ultimate truth. {60}</p>
<p>“Devas, nāgas, asuras, and guhyakas</p>
<p>Were dedicated to making offerings to that Jina.</p>
<p>A rain of flowers rained down there</p>
<p>For the enlightenment and buddhahood of this guide of humans. {61}</p>
<p>“They played drums up above in the sky</p>
<p>In order to honor and make offerings to that jina,</p>
<p>And they greatly sorrowed that the Jina</p>
<p>For a long time did not realize the highest state. {62}</p>
<p>“Then after ten intermediate eons had passed</p>
<p>Bhagavān Anābhibhū attained enlightenment.</p>
<p>At that time, the devas, humans, nāgas, and asuras</p>
<p>All rejoiced and were overjoyed. {63}</p>
<p>“The sixteen young heroes who were the sons</p>
<p>Of that guide of humans, the one wealthy in qualities,</p>
<p>Leading thousands of millions of beings,</p>
<p>Came before the highest Lord of All Humans. {64}</p>
<p>“They bowed to the feet of the Guide</p>
<p>And requested him, ‘Lion who is Lord of Humans,</p>
<p>Teach the Dharma! With your excellent speech</p>
<p>Satisfy us who are in this world. {65}</p>
<p>“ ‘Great Guide, after a long time your appearance</p>
<p>Is known in the worlds in the ten directions.</p>
<p>There are omens that have aroused beings.</p>
<p>The airborne palaces of the Brahmās have been shaken. {66}</p>
<p>“ ‘In the eastern direction five hundred</p>
<p>Thousand million worlds have been shaken.</p>
<p>The supreme airborne palaces of the Brahmās</p>
<p>Have become endowed with extreme brilliance. {67}</p>
<p>“ ‘Seeing omens such as these</p>
<p>They have come before the Lord, the Guide of the World,</p>
<p>And they have scattered flowers over the Guide</p>
<p>And offered to you all of their airborne palaces. {68}</p>
<p>“ ‘They request you turn the wheel</p>
<p>And praise you through verses.</p>
<p>But, King and Lord of Humans, you are remaining silent,</p>
<p>As if to say, “It is not yet time for me to teach the Dharma.” {69}</p>
<p>“ ‘It has been the same in the southern direction</p>
<p>And similarly in the west, below, and in the north,</p>
<p>And the same above and in the intermediate directions,</p>
<p>And billions of Brahmās have arrived here. {70}</p>
<p>“ ‘They have scattered flowers upon the Guide</p>
<p>And bowed to the feet of the Leader.</p>
<p>They have brought to you all their airborne palaces</p>
<p>And have praised you and again supplicated you. {71}</p>
<p>“ ‘You with infinite vision, turn the wheel!</p>
<p>In many millions of eons you are difficult to find.</p>
<p>Reveal the power of kindness that you have developed in the past</p>
<p>And open the door to deathlessness.’ {72}</p>
<p>“The one with infinite sight knew their request</p>
<p>And taught the Dharma in many ways.</p>
<p>He taught the four truths extensively,</p>
<p>And the dependent origination of all that occurs. {73}</p>
<p>“The one with infinite sight explained</p>
<p>Ignorance as the first cause, and the suffering of death:</p>
<p>‘Know that the death of humans and</p>
<p>All these faults originate from birth.’ {74}</p>
<p>“As soon as he taught the Dharma</p>
<p>In infinite various ways,</p>
<p>Eighty quintillion beings who heard it</p>
<p>Quickly reached the level of the śrāvakas. {75}</p>
<p>“Then the following second time</p>
<p>That the Jina taught many dharmas,</p>
<p>Beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges</p>
<p>Instantaneously became śrāvakas. {76}</p>
<p>“After that, at that time, the saṅgha</p>
<p>Of the world’s guide became innumerable.</p>
<p>Even if you were to count them for a quintillion eons</p>
<p>You would not reach the end of them. {77}</p>
<p>“Those sixteen princes,</p>
<p>Who were his own young sons,</p>
<p>Those mendicants requested the Jina,</p>
<p>‘Guide, teach us the highest Dharma! {78}</p>
<p>“ ‘May we become knowers of the world</p>
<p>Just like you, supreme among all beings!</p>
<p>May all of these beings who exist</p>
<p>Become just like you, the hero with pure sight!’ {79}</p>
<p>“The Jina, knowing the aspiration</p>
<p>Of the youths who were his own sons,</p>
<p>Taught the highest, supreme enlightenment</p>
<p>Through many quintillions of parables. {80}</p>
<p>“He taught through many thousands of causes,</p>
<p>Displaying higher knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>The Lord of the World taught the true conduct,</p>
<p>Just as is practiced by wise bodhisattvas. {81}</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān taught this extensive sūtra,</p>
<p>The White Lotus of the Good Dharma,</p>
<p>Through no fewer than thousands of verses</p>
<p>As numerous as the sand grains of the Ganges. {82}</p>
<p>“The Jina, having taught that sūtra,</p>
<p>Entered the temple where the Lord of the World</p>
<p>Contemplated in meditation on one seat</p>
<p>For an entire eighty-four eons. {83}</p>
<p>“The mendicants, knowing that the Guide</p>
<p>Was seated in the temple and was not coming out,</p>
<p>Proclaimed to many millions of beings</p>
<p>The immaculate wisdom and peace of this buddhahood. {84}</p>
<p>“They each arranged their own throne</p>
<p>And taught upon it this very sūtra,</p>
<p>And in that way fulfilled that role</p>
<p>Within the teaching of that sugata. {85}</p>
<p>“Each of those sons of the Sugata</p>
<p>At that time taught beings as numerous</p>
<p>As the sand grains of sixty thousand Ganges</p>
<p>And guided an endless number of beings. {86}</p>
<p>“When the Jina had passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Following their proper conduct, they saw millions of buddhas,</p>
<p>And together with those who had listened to them</p>
<p>They made offerings to those supreme humans. {87}</p>
<p>“They engaged in conduct that was vast and superior</p>
<p>And attained enlightenment, buddhahood in the ten directions.</p>
<p>Those sixteen sons of the Jina became</p>
<p>Two jinas in each of the directions. {88}</p>
<p>“At that time, those who had listened to them</p>
<p>All became the śrāvakas of those jinas,</p>
<p>And attained this enlightenment</p>
<p>In stages through various methods. {89}</p>
<p>“I also was one among them</p>
<p>And you all have listened to me.</p>
<p>Therefore you are still my śrāvakas</p>
<p>And using methods I lead you all to this enlightenment. {90}</p>
<p>“In that past time there was this cause, this condition,</p>
<p>Because of which I am teaching the Dharma,</p>
<p>And because of which I am leading you to enlightenment.</p>
<p>So, bhikṣus, have no fear in these circumstances. {91}</p>
<p>“If there were a dreadful, terrible jungle</p>
<p>That was uninhabited, with no shelter or refuge,</p>
<p>With many wild beasts and no water</p>
<p>And which was terrifying for the foolish, {92}</p>
<p>“And if many thousands of people</p>
<p>Were to enter into that jungle,</p>
<p>And that jungle was uninhabited and long,</p>
<p>A full five hundred yojanas, {93}</p>
<p>“And if there were a wealthy, mindful, learned,</p>
<p>Brave, educated, and fearless person</p>
<p>Who was there as their guide</p>
<p>In that terrifying, dreadful jungle, {94}</p>
<p>“Those many thousands of beings would become exhausted</p>
<p>And at that time they would say to the guide,</p>
<p>‘Noble sir, we are exhausted and we cannot go on.</p>
<p>It is our wish that we turn back today!’ {95}</p>
<p>“He who is wise and who is skilled</p>
<p>Would think of a method by which he might lead them:</p>
<p>‘Alas, all of these foolish persons</p>
<p>Will deprive themselves of the jewels if they turn back. {96}</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall today through my miraculous powers</p>
<p>Cause a great city to appear</p>
<p>That is adorned with a billion houses</p>
<p>And beautified by temples and gardens. {97}</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall manifest ponds and rivers</p>
<p>Adorned with groves and flowers.</p>
<p>I shall create a beautiful wall and gates,</p>
<p>And men and women without an equal. {98}</p>
<p>“ ‘And having manifested all that I shall say to them,</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, but be happy!</p>
<p>You have now reached this perfect city;</p>
<p>Enter it and quickly fulfill your needs.” ’ {99}</p>
<p>“In order that they might gain relief</p>
<p>And that they would not turn back, he says,</p>
<p>‘You have passed through the dreadful jungle</p>
<p>So now be at ease and be happy.’ {100}</p>
<p>“When he sees that they are all rested,</p>
<p>He gathers them together and says to them,</p>
<p>‘Come here, and listen to what I have to say!</p>
<p>This city is a manifestation of my miraculous powers. {101}</p>
<p>“ ‘I had seen that you were exhausted</p>
<p>And this was to prevent your turning back.</p>
<p>This was my skillful method.</p>
<p>Be diligent and proceed to the island!’ {102}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, I am like that guide—</p>
<p>The guide of ten thousand million beings.</p>
<p>See the exhausted beings as those</p>
<p>Who cannot break out through the eggshell of the kleśas. {103}</p>
<p>“I thought that for their benefit</p>
<p>I should create this nirvāṇa as a rest.</p>
<p>On the level of the arhat you have accomplished your goal,</p>
<p>Which is the cessation of all suffering. {104}</p>
<p>“When I see that you are all</p>
<p>Arhats who are upon this level,</p>
<p>Then I gather you all together</p>
<p>And tell you truly what the Dharma is. {105}</p>
<p>“When the rishis teach that there are three yānas,</p>
<p>That is the skillful method of the guides.</p>
<p>There is one yāna; there is no second.</p>
<p>Two are taught so that there may be a rest. {106}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, therefore on this day I declare</p>
<p>That just this is not nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>You must develop a powerful diligence</p>
<p>In order to attain omniscient wisdom. {107}</p>
<p>“When you attain omniscient wisdom,</p>
<p>The qualities of a jina, the ten strengths,</p>
<p>And a body that has the thirty-two signs,</p>
<p>Then you will be a buddha, and that is nirvāṇa. {108}</p>
<p>“This is the nature of the teaching of the guides:</p>
<p>They teach nirvāṇa so that beings may rest.</p>
<p>Knowing that they have rested in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>They lead all to omniscient wisdom.” {109}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Past,” the seventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Prophecy to the Five Hundred Bhikṣus</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>Brother Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra, having heard directly from the Bhagavān about this wisdom insight into skillful methods, about the teachings with implied meaning, and having heard the prophecies made to the great śrāvakas, and having heard of the connections with the past, and having heard of the preeminence of the Bhagavān, was astonished and amazed, without worldly concerns, and filled with delight and joy. Then with great delight and joy and great reverence for the Dharma, he rose from his seat, bowed down to the feet of the Bhagavān, and thought, “Bhagavān, it is wonderful! Sugata, it is wonderful! The tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas accomplish that which is extremely difficult—they teach the Dharma to beings according to the different concerns of the world, through many wisdom insights into skillful methods, and they liberate beings attached to this and that. Bhagavān, what are we able to do? The Tathāgata is the one who knows our aspirations and our past.”</p>
<p>He bowed down to the Bhagavān’s feet and then sat to one side and with his hands placed together in homage gazed unblinking upon the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān, seeing the thoughts in the mind of Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra, said to the complete saṅgha of bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, look upon my śrāvaka Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra. He is the best teacher among those who teach the Dharma within my saṅgha of bhikṣus, and he is praised for having many true qualities. He is dedicated to holding the Dharma in many ways within my teaching. He tirelessly teaches the Dharma, bringing joy to the four assemblies, encouraging them, and inspiring them. He is able to teach the Dharma. He is able to aid those who maintain celibacy.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, other than the Tathāgata, there is no one who can match Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra in meaning or in words.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, what do you think? If you think that he has been a holder solely of my Dharma, bhikṣus, you should not regard him in that way. Why is that? Bhikṣus, I remember that in the past, in a time gone by, he was a holder of the Dharma of nine hundred and ninety million buddhas. Just as he is now the supreme teacher of my Dharma, so he was for all of them. For all of them he was someone who had realized emptiness. For all of them he was someone who had attained discernment. For all of them he was someone who had realized the higher knowledge of a bodhisattva. He was someone who taught the Dharma with complete certainty. He was someone who taught the Dharma free of doubt. He was someone who taught the Dharma in its purity. In the teaching of those buddha bhagavāns he practiced the conduct of celibacy throughout his life, and everywhere he was known as a śrāvaka. By this method, he benefited innumerable, countless hundred thousand quintillions of beings. He ripened innumerable, countless beings for the highest, complete enlightenment. At all times he has served beings through the activity of a buddha. At all times he has been purifying his own buddha realm, and has been dedicated to ripening beings.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, he has been the primary teacher of the Dharma for the seven tathāgatas, the first of whom was Vipaśyin and of whom I am the seventh.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in the future in this fortunate eon, this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇī­putra will be the principal teacher of the Dharma within the teachings of the thousand buddhas less four, and he will be a holder of their teaching. In the same way, in the future he will hold the entire Dharma of innumerable, countless buddha bhagavāns. He will benefit innumerable, countless beings. He will ripen innumerable, countless beings for the highest, complete enlightenment. He will be someone who is continuously dedicated. He will be dedicated to purifying his own buddha realm and ripening beings. He will in this way perfect his bodhisattva conduct and after innumerable, countless eons he will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. He will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Dharmaprabhāsa. He will appear in this very buddha realm.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time this buddha realm will be like billion-world world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River combined into one buddha realm. The ground will be made of the seven precious materials. It will be as level as the palm of a hand. There will be no mountains. It will be filled with kūṭāgāras made of the seven precious materials. The airborne palaces of the devas will be close so that the devas can see the humans, and the humans can see the devas.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time, in this buddha realm, there will be no lower existences and there will be no women. All the beings there will be born miraculously. They will practice celibacy with their immaterial bodies. They will emit their own light. They will have miraculous powers. They will fly through the air. They will have diligence. They will have mindfulness. They will have wisdom. They will have golden bodies adorned by the thirty-two signs of a great being.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, at that time, in this buddha realm, those beings will have two kinds of food. What will they be? They will be the food of joy in the Dharma and the food of joy in meditation. He will have innumerable, countless hundred thousand quintillions of bodhisattvas. All of them will have attained the higher knowledges, have the realization of the discernments, and be skilled in instructing beings. His śrāvakas will be beyond number and they will all have great miraculous abilities, great power, the eight liberations, and dhyāna. That buddha realm will have limitless qualities of this kind. The eon will be named Ratnāvabhāsa. The world will be named Suviśuddhā. At that time, the lifespan will be innumerable, countess eons. When the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Dharmaprabhāsa has passed into nirvāṇa his Dharma will remain for a long time. That world will be filled with stūpas made of precious materials.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, in that way the buddha realm of that bhagavān will have inconceivable qualities.”</p>
<p>That is what the Bhagavān said. The Sugata having spoken these words, the Teacher then pronounced these verses:</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, listen to me, to this meaning:</p>
<p>The way in which my son has practiced conduct,</p>
<p>Has trained well in skillful methods,</p>
<p>And how he has practiced bodhisattva conduct. {1}</p>
<p>“Knowing that beings here aspire to the inferior</p>
<p>And are frightened of the powerful yāna,</p>
<p>The bodhisattvas became śrāvakas</p>
<p>And manifested the attaining of pratyeka­buddha enlightenment. {2}</p>
<p>“Through many hundreds of skillful methods</p>
<p>They ripen many bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘We who are śrāvakas</p>
<p>Are far from the supreme, highest enlightenment.’ {3}</p>
<p>“Through practicing that conduct</p>
<p>Millions of beings become ripened.</p>
<p>Even those with inferior aspiration and laziness</p>
<p>All eventually become buddhas. {4}</p>
<p>“They practice their conduct unobserved,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘We are śrāvakas with little to accomplish.’</p>
<p>Dismayed by all death and rebirth,</p>
<p>They purify their own realms. {5}</p>
<p>“They teach as if they themselves have desire</p>
<p>And also have anger and ignorance,</p>
<p>Knowing that beings have attachment to views,</p>
<p>And so they resort to having those views. {6}</p>
<p>“My śrāvakas have acted in many such ways,</p>
<p>Liberating beings through such methods.</p>
<p>If I were to teach all of their modes of conduct</p>
<p>It would render humans without wisdom insane. {7}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, this Pūrna, my śrāvaka,</p>
<p>Has practiced under billions of past buddhas;</p>
<p>Has been a holder of their Dharma,</p>
<p>Seeking for this wisdom of buddhahood. {8}</p>
<p>“At all times he has been their principal śrāvaka,</p>
<p>Greatly learned, and fearlessly giving various teachings.</p>
<p>He has been continuously joyful and never wearied,</p>
<p>Fulfilling always the activities of the buddhas. {9}</p>
<p>“He always has understanding through the great higher knowledges,</p>
<p>And has the attainment of the discernments.</p>
<p>He knows the scope of the faculties of beings</p>
<p>And always teaches the completely pure Dharma. {10}</p>
<p>“He teaches the Dharma that is supreme,</p>
<p>Ripens thousands of millions of beings</p>
<p>In this supreme, unsurpassable yāna,</p>
<p>And is purifying his own realm. {11}</p>
<p>“In a future time, similarly</p>
<p>He will make offerings to millions of buddhas,</p>
<p>Be a holder of their supreme Dharma,</p>
<p>And will be purifying his own realm. {12}</p>
<p>“He always teaches the Dharma fearlessly</p>
<p>And through billions of skillful methods,</p>
<p>And ripens many beings</p>
<p>For immaculate omniscience. {13}</p>
<p>“He will make offerings to the guides of humans</p>
<p>And he will always be a holder of the supreme Dharma,</p>
<p>And then will become a self-arisen buddha in the world,</p>
<p>And will be famous in all directions as Dharmaprabhāsa. {14}</p>
<p>“His realm will be completely pure,</p>
<p>Constantly excellent, made of the seven precious materials.</p>
<p>That eon will be named Ratnāvabhāsa,</p>
<p>And his realm will be named Suviśuddhā. {15}</p>
<p>“There will be many billions of bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who have great higher knowledge and are supremely skilled.</p>
<p>They will exist throughout that realm</p>
<p>And will have pure minds and great miracles. {16}</p>
<p>“In the same way there will be billions of śrāvakas</p>
<p>Who at that time will be the saṅgha of the Guide.</p>
<p>They will have the eight liberations, dhyāna, great miracles,</p>
<p>And have the realization of the discernments. {17}</p>
<p>“All the beings who will be in that realm</p>
<p>Will delight in the practice of celibacy.</p>
<p>They will all be golden and be born miraculously,</p>
<p>And have bodies that possess the thirty-two signs. {18}</p>
<p>“They will have no concept of food</p>
<p>Other than joy in the Dharma and joy in dhyāna.</p>
<p>There will be no women there,</p>
<p>And no lower existences, no lower realms. {19}</p>
<p>“Pūrna will have that kind of supreme realm</p>
<p>That possesses such a perfection of qualities</p>
<p>And is completely filled with virtuous beings;</p>
<p>I have described just a few of them.” {20}</p>
<p>Then the twelve hundred who had mastered themselves thought, “The Bhagavān has given prophecies to those great śrāvakas, and it would be marvelous and wonderful if the Tathāgata were to give a prophecy to each one of us also.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān knew the thoughts that were in the minds of those great śrāvakas and said to Brother Mahākāśyapa, “Kāśyapa, I shall next give prophecies to these twelve hundred who have mastered themselves and are in my presence.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, the great śrāvaka bhikṣu Kauṇḍinya, after sixty-two hundred thousand quintillion buddhas, and even further beyond that, will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Samanta­prabhāsa.</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, there will be five hundred tathāgatas who have that same name. Five hundred great śrāvakas will be next after Kauṇḍinya to attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood and all of them will have the name Samanta­prabhāsa. They are Gayākāśyapa, Nadīkāśyapa, Uru­vilvā­kāśyapa, Kāla, Kālodāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphiṇa, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and the rest of the five hundred who have gained mastery over themselves.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Kauṇḍinyagotra, this śrāvaka of mine,</p>
<p>Will become a tathāgata, a lord of the world.</p>
<p>In a future time, after endless eons,</p>
<p>He will guide billions of beings. {21}</p>
<p>“He will become a jina named Samantaprabha.</p>
<p>His realm will be completely pure,</p>
<p>After endless eons, in a future time,</p>
<p>After seeing many, endless buddhas. {22}</p>
<p>“He will shine and have the strengths of a buddha.</p>
<p>His words will be renowned in the ten directions.</p>
<p>Billions of beings will be in his presence</p>
<p>And he will teach them the supreme, highest enlightenment. {23}</p>
<p>“There the dedicated bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Will enter their airborne palaces</p>
<p>And they will dwell there in contemplation,</p>
<p>Always with pure conduct and excellent behavior. {24}</p>
<p>“They will listen to the Dharma of the supreme human</p>
<p>And also constantly travel to other realms</p>
<p>Where they will praise thousands of buddhas</p>
<p>And make vast offerings to them. {25}</p>
<p>“In an instant they will also return</p>
<p>To the realm of the Guide.</p>
<p>That supreme human, named Prabhāsa,</p>
<p>Will have that kind of powerful conduct. {26}</p>
<p>“The lifespan of that sugata</p>
<p>Will be a full sixty thousand eons.</p>
<p>And when that protector has passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>His Dharma will remain for twice as long. {27}</p>
<p>“The outer form of his Dharma, too,</p>
<p>Will remain for a duration three times as long.</p>
<p>When the Dharma of that protector has disappeared,</p>
<p>Devas and humans will be in suffering. {28}</p>
<p>“There will then be, in succession,</p>
<p>A full five hundred guides,</p>
<p>Supreme humans, jinas,</p>
<p>With the same name: Samantaprabha. {29}</p>
<p>“All of them will have the same manifestation</p>
<p>Of miraculous powers and a buddha realm.</p>
<p>Their assemblies and their Dharma will be the same,</p>
<p>And the duration of their Dharma will also be the same. {30}</p>
<p>“Their names and their worlds with their devas</p>
<p>Will all be exactly the same as</p>
<p>What I have previously described</p>
<p>For the supreme human Samanta­prabhāsa. {31}</p>
<p>“These compassionate benefiters</p>
<p>Will successively prophesy the others,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘After me, it will be</p>
<p>Just as I have taught to all the world.’ {32}</p>
<p>“Kāśyapa, from today you should hold in this way</p>
<p>These who have mastered themselves, who number</p>
<p>No less than five hundred, and also others of my śrāvakas,</p>
<p>And you should speak of this to other śrāvakas also.” {33}</p>
<p>Then those five hundred arhats, on hearing the prophecy of their attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, felt contented, delighted, elated, and joyful. With happiness and gladness they approached the Bhagavān, bowed their heads to his feet, and said to him, “Bhagavān, we confess this offence of ours: we have been always continuously thinking, ‘This is our nirvāṇa,’ or, ‘We have attained nirvāṇa.’ Bhagavān, we lacked understanding, lacked skill, and lacked knowledge. Why is that? We thought, ‘There is the attainment of buddhahood through the wisdom of the tathāgatas, but we are satisfied with a limited wisdom.’</p>
<p>“As an analogy, imagine if there were a man who went to a friend’s home, and became drunk or fell asleep. Then the friend sews a priceless jewel into the hem of his clothing, saying, ‘This is a precious jewel!’ The man then rises from his seat and leaves. He goes to another country and there he runs into misfortune. He undergoes great difficulties and hardship in his search for food and clothing. When he finds just a little food he is delighted and overjoyed.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, then that man’s old friend who had sewn the priceless jewel in the hem of that man’s clothing sees him, and says to him, ‘Oh, my friend! Why are you undergoing this hardship seeking for food and clothing? I sewed a precious jewel, a priceless jewel that could fulfill all your desires, into the hem of your clothes so that you could live happily. My friend, I have given you that precious jewel. My friend, I have sewn that precious jewel in the hem of your clothing. My friend, you have not looked for it at all, wondering, “When was it sewn in? Who sewed it in? Why did he sew it in?” Oh my friend, you are a fool that you have accepted to undergo such hardship in searching for food and clothing! My friend, take this precious jewel and go to the big city, and in the big city with that jewel obtain all the wealth that you want!’</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, it is likewise that the Tathāgata has previously taught the practice of bodhisattva conduct and the aspiration for omniscience, but we did not know it, we did not understand it.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, therefore our thoughts were of nirvāṇa, the level of the arhat. Bhagavān, we have lived in great hardship. Bhagavān, we have been content to seek limited wisdom. Because we have never ceased from our prayers for omniscient wisdom, Bhagavān, the Tathāgata has made us understand, saying, ‘You bhikṣus, do not think that this is nirvāṇa! Bhikṣus, there are the roots of merit in your beings that I have ripened in the past. It was through my skillful method that through my teaching and speaking of the Dharma you came to think, “This is nirvāṇa!” ’</p>
<p>“In that way the Bhagavān has made us understand, and today has given us the prophecy of our attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.”</p>
<p>At that time, Ājñāta­kauṇḍinya and the five hundred who had gained mastery over themselves recited these verses:</p>
<p>“We are delighted and overjoyed to have heard</p>
<p>Such a supreme reassurance as this,</p>
<p>The prophecy of our highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>We pay homage to you, the Guide with infinite vision. {34}</p>
<p>“We confess our fault in your presence:</p>
<p>We were foolish, unwise, and unknowing,</p>
<p>And within the teachings of the Sugata</p>
<p>We were content with mere nirvāṇa. {35}</p>
<p>“It is as if there were a man</p>
<p>Who went into the home of his friend.</p>
<p>His friend was someone who was very wealthy</p>
<p>And gave him much to eat and drink. {36}</p>
<p>“Having satisfied him with food</p>
<p>He gave him a jewel of great value,</p>
<p>Sewing it into the hem of his upper robe,</p>
<p>And he was happy to have given it to him. {37}</p>
<p>“Then that fool, he departed.</p>
<p>He left and went to another town.</p>
<p>He fell into hardship, was destitute and in need,</p>
<p>Searching for food in a state of distress. {38}</p>
<p>“He gained relief from misery through finding food,</p>
<p>But he did not think of obtaining a great amount to eat.</p>
<p>He had forgotten that he possessed the jewel.</p>
<p>He did not remember that it was in the hem of his clothing. {39}</p>
<p>“Then when his old friend saw him,</p>
<p>The friend duly admonished him that he possessed</p>
<p>The jewel that he had given him, back in his house,</p>
<p>And showed him the jewel in the hem of his clothing. {40}</p>
<p>“The jewel had such power</p>
<p>That when the man saw it he became supremely happy;</p>
<p>He became very wealthy, had the power of treasure,</p>
<p>And obtained the pleasures of the five senses. {41}</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we are just like that:</p>
<p>We are unaware of the past prayers</p>
<p>That the Tathāgata has given us</p>
<p>In many lifetimes in the past, a long time ago. {42}</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we have the understanding of fools.</p>
<p>Within the Sugata’s teaching we are without knowledge.</p>
<p>We were content with nirvāṇa alone,</p>
<p>And did not think of any higher goal. {43}</p>
<p>“The friend to the world has made us realize,</p>
<p>‘There is no nirvāṇa such as this.’</p>
<p>It is the supreme wisdom of the highest beings</p>
<p>That nirvāṇa is the supreme bliss. {44}</p>
<p>“We have heard this supreme prophecy</p>
<p>That is vast, extensive, and diverse.</p>
<p>Lord, these successive prophecies</p>
<p>Have made us happy, delighted, and overjoyed.” {45}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Prophecy to the Five Hundred Bhikṣus,” the eighth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Prophecies to Ānanda, Rāhula, and Two Thousand Bhikṣus</p>
<p>Chapter 9</p>
<p>At that time, Brother Ānanda thought, “May I obtain a prophecy like these!” Thinking that, contemplating it, and wishing for it, he rose from his seat and bowed down to the Bhagavān’s feet. Brother Rāhula also, thinking, contemplating, and wishing for the same thing, bowed down to the Bhagavān’s feet, and they said, “Bhagavān, may we have such an opportunity! Sugata, may we have such an opportunity! Bhagavān, you are our father, our progenitor, our refuge, our support, and our protector. Bhagavān, we are honored by the world with its devas, humans, and asuras as the sons of the Bhagavān, the attendants of the Bhagavān, and the keepers of the Dharma treasure of the Bhagavān. Therefore, Bhagavān, it would be fitting if the Bhagavān were quickly to give us the prophecy of our attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.”</p>
<p>Moreover, more than two thousand bhikṣus, those in training and those passed beyond training, rose from their seats, removed their upper robe from one shoulder, and with hands together in homage stood facing the Bhagavān, gazing upon him and contemplating the wisdom of the Buddha, and thought, “May we also obtain the prophecy of our attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment!”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Ānanda, “You, Ānanda, in a future time, will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña.</p>
<p>“You will honor, venerate, show respect for, and make offerings to six hundred and twenty million buddhas, receive the Dharma from them, and uphold their teaching. You will attain the highest, complete enlightenment and ripen for complete enlightenment hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sands in two hundred million Ganges Rivers.</p>
<p>“Your buddha realm will be fully endowed with a ground made of beryl. That realm will be named An­avanāmita­vaijayantī. That eon will be named Manojña­śabdābhi­garjita. The lifespan of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña will be innumerable eons. One could not conclude measuring the lifespan of that bhagavān. It will be countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, the Dharma of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña will remain after his nirvāṇa for twice as long as his lifespan.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña will be praised in the ten directions by many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in ten million Ganges Rivers.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“I declare to you, the saṅgha of bhikṣus,</p>
<p>Good Ānanda, the holder of my teaching,</p>
<p>Will in the future become a jina</p>
<p>After making offerings to six hundred million sugatas. {1}</p>
<p>“His name will be Sāgara­buddhi­dhārin</p>
<p>And he will be renowned as Abhijñaprāpta</p>
<p>In the beautiful, completely pure realm</p>
<p>An­avana­tā Dhvaja­vaijayantī. {2}</p>
<p>“There he will ripen bodhisattvas</p>
<p>More numerous than the Ganges sands.</p>
<p>He will be a jina with great miraculous powers</p>
<p>And will be renowned in the worlds in the ten directions. {3}</p>
<p>“At that time his lifespan will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>He will remain as beneficial and compassionate to the world.</p>
<p>After that protector has passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>His Dharma will remain for twice as long. {4}</p>
<p>“Then its outer form will remain for twice as long as that,</p>
<p>And within the teachings of that jina</p>
<p>There will be beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges</p>
<p>Who will create the cause for the enlightenment of buddhahood.” {5}</p>
<p>In that assembly at that time there were eight thousand bodhisattvas, who had newly entered the yāna, who thought, “We have never before heard such an extensive prophecy for bodhisattvas, let alone for the śrāvakas. What could be the cause, what could be the reason for this?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān, knowing the thoughts and contemplation in the minds of those bodhisattvas, said to those bodhisattvas, “Noble sons, Ānanda and I together, at the same moment, developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment in front of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Dharma­gaganābhyudgata­rāja. This noble son has been continuously dedicated to receiving many teachings, while I was dedicated to diligent practice. That is why I have quickly attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, and it is why this good Ānanda will be the keeper of the Dharma treasures of the buddha bhagavāns. Noble sons, it is the prayer of this noble son that this will be the cause for bodhisattvas reaching perfection.”</p>
<p>Brother Ānanda heard from the Bhagavān the prediction of his own attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment. He heard the description of the qualities of his own buddha realm, and he heard of his past prayer and conduct. Then he was contented, delighted, elated, and joyful, and he became glad and happy. At that time he remembered the Dharma of the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas, and the prayer that he had made in the past.</p>
<p>Then Ānanda recited these verses:</p>
<p>“The countless jinas are so wonderful.</p>
<p>They have caused me to remember the Dharma teachings.</p>
<p>I remember, as if it were today or yesterday,</p>
<p>The protectors, the jinas, who have passed into nirvāṇa. {6}</p>
<p>“I am free of doubt, I am fixed upon enlightenment.</p>
<p>This is the nature of my skill in methods.</p>
<p>I am the attendant of the Sugata</p>
<p>And I hold the Dharma for the sake of enlightenment.” {7}</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Brother Rāhula, “You, Rāhula, in a future time will honor, venerate, show respect for, and make offerings to tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas as numerous as the atoms in ten worlds. Then you will become the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Sapta­ratna­padma­vikrānta­gāmin.</p>
<p>“You will constantly be the eldest son of those buddha bhagavāns, as you are for me. Rāhula, the lifespan of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sapta­ratna­padma­vikrānta­gāmin will be the same as that of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña. The perfection of all his many qualities will be like his, and he will have the same display of the qualities of his buddha realm as Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña.</p>
<p>“Rāhula, you will be the eldest son of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgara­vara­dhara­buddhi­vikrīḍitābhijña, and after that you will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“This Rāhula, my eldest son,</p>
<p>Was my own son when he was a child.</p>
<p>Even after enlightenment, he is my son,</p>
<p>A great rishi who holds the inheritance of Dharma. {8}</p>
<p>“In the future, he will see many</p>
<p>Countless millions of buddhas;</p>
<p>Because he is seeking enlightenment</p>
<p>He will be the son of all those jinas. {9}</p>
<p>“This activity of Rāhula is not known,</p>
<p>But I know the prayers he has made.</p>
<p>He lauds the friends of the world,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘I am the son of the Tathāgata!’ {10}</p>
<p>“Rāhula, who is my own son,</p>
<p>Has countless quintillions of qualities</p>
<p>That can never be measured.</p>
<p>Thus he remains for the sake of enlightenment.” {11}</p>
<p>The Bhagavān looked upon two thousand śrāvakas, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training, who in the presence of the Bhagavān were gazing upon the Bhagavān with tranquil minds, placid minds, and gentle minds.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān asked Brother Ānanda, “Ānanda, do you see these two thousand śrāvakas, both those in training and those who have passed beyond training?”</p>
<p>“I see them, Bhagavān,” he answered. “I see them, Sugata.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Bhagavān, “all those two thousand bhikṣus will together practice the conduct of a bodhisattva. They will honor, venerate, show respect for, and make offerings to buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the atoms in fifty worlds, and be holders of their Dharma. Then in their last lives, in the same instant, the same moment, the same second, they will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, each in their own buddha realm among the worlds in the ten directions. They will be tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas named Ratnaketurāja. Their lifespans will be an entire eon. Their buddha realms will have the same display of qualities. Their gatherings of śrāvakas and gatherings of bodhisattvas will also be the same in number. They will all pass into nirvāṇa at the same time. Their Dharma also will remain for the same length of time.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Ānanda, those who are assembled before me,</p>
<p>All of these two thousand śrāvakas.</p>
<p>Will in the future become tathāgatas.</p>
<p>Today I make this prophecy about these wise ones. {12}</p>
<p>“As is taught in endless analogies,</p>
<p>They will make supreme offerings to the buddhas,</p>
<p>And then when they are within their last bodies</p>
<p>They will attain this supreme enlightenment. {13}</p>
<p>“In the ten directions, having the same name,</p>
<p>In the same instant, the same moment,</p>
<p>They will be seated at the foot of the supreme tree.</p>
<p>They will attain wisdom and become buddhas. {14}</p>
<p>“They will all have the same name:</p>
<p>They will be renowned in the world as Ratnaketu.</p>
<p>Their supreme realms will be the same,</p>
<p>Their śrāvaka and bodhisattva assemblies will be the same. {15}</p>
<p>“With miraculous powers in these worlds,</p>
<p>And equally throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>They will teach the Dharma and their nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And the duration of their Dharma will be the same.” {16}</p>
<p>Those śrāvakas, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training, upon hearing directly from the Bhagavān the prophecies for each of them, became contented, delighted, elated, and joyful, and became glad and happy.</p>
<p>Thereupon they recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“Lamp of the World, we have been made content</p>
<p>Through having heard this prophecy.</p>
<p>Tathāgata, we have become as happy</p>
<p>As if we were sprinkled with amrita. {17}</p>
<p>“We do not have any doubt or uncertainty,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘We will not become supreme humans.’</p>
<p>Today we have attained happiness</p>
<p>Through having heard this prophecy.” {18}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Prophecies to Ānanda, Rāhula, and Two Thousand Bhikṣus,” the ninth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Dharmabhāṇakas</p>
<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and eighty thousand other bodhisattvas, “Bhaiṣajyarāja, do you see this assembly’s numerous devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas and upāsikās, and followers of the Śrāvakayāna and the Bodhisattva­yāna who have heard this Dharma teaching directly from the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p>“I see them, Bhagavān,” he answered. “I see them, Sugata.”</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja,” said the Bhagavān, “these are all bodhisattvas, mahāsattvas. Whoever among them has heard even one verse, or heard one line of a verse, or with just one aspiration has rejoiced in this sūtra, for all those in the fourfold assembly, Bhaiṣajyarāja, I prophesy that they will attain the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, if anyone after my nirvāṇa hears this Dharma teaching, or hears just one verse of it, or with just one aspiration rejoices in it, I prophesy that those noble men or noble women will attain the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, those noble men or noble women will have served a full hundred thousand quintillion buddhas.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, those noble men or noble women will have prayed to many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, know that those noble men or noble women will have taken birth as humans in this Jambudvīpa out of compassion for beings.</p>
<p>“Whoever retains even just one verse from this Dharma teaching, or reads it, or teaches it, or recites it, or writes it, or having written it remembers it, or from time to time looks at it; and whoever has the same veneration for the text as one would have for the Tathāgata, and honors, venerates, and makes offerings to it, venerating it as if it were the Teacher; and whoever offers flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, divine flags, the sound of music, and so on, to the text, while bowing down and putting hands together in homage; and those noble men or noble women, Bhaiṣajyarāja, who rejoice in just one verse from this Dharma teaching, Bhaiṣajyarāja, I prophesy that all of them will attain the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, if any man or woman asks, ‘What kind of beings are these who will become tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in the future?’ Bhaiṣajyarāja, those men or women, those noble men or noble women should be taught in this way: ‘Behold! Whoever possesses or hears even one four-line verse from this Dharma teaching, or teaches it, or honors this Dharma teaching, it is that noble man or noble woman who in the future will come into the world as a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha.’</p>
<p>“Why is that? Bhaiṣajyarāja, any noble man or noble woman who retains just one verse from this Dharma teaching should be seen by the world and its devas as tathāgatas and be honored by them as if they were tathāgatas, let alone someone who obtains the entirety of this Dharma teaching and retains it, teaches it, recites it, writes it, or having written it remembers it, and honors it by making offerings of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, divine flags, the sound of music, and so on, to the text, and with hands together in homage bows down to it.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, that noble son or noble woman should be known to have attained the highest, complete enlightenment. They should be known to have seen the tathāgatas. They have, out of compassion, in order to benefit the world, been born as humans in this Jambudvīpa through the power of prayer in order to teach this Dharma teaching. Know that they will leave behind vast Dharma activity and rebirth in buddha realms, in order to perfectly teach this Dharma teaching, and after my nirvāṇa they will be born here out of compassion for beings and in order to benefit them.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, after the Tathāgata’s passing into nirvāṇa, the one who teaches this Dharma teaching, even someone who secretly and deviously teaches it to just one being, Bhaiṣajyarāja, that noble man or noble woman should be known to be the Tathāgata’s messenger. That noble man or noble woman should be known to have been sent to do the Tathāgata’s work.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, I state that if someone speaks badly to dharmabhāṇakas who hold this sūtra, be they laypeople or renunciants, and whether what is said be true or not, the bad karma will be much more dreadful than if a being with an angry mind, an evil mind, and a wrathful mind were to speak badly to the Tathāgata to his face for an entire eon. Why is that? Bhaiṣajyarāja, it is because that noble man or noble woman should be known to be an adornment that adorns the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, those who write out this Dharma teaching to create a text and carry it on their shoulder carry the Tathāgata on their shoulder. Wherever they go, there beings should honor, venerate, and make offerings to them, and with hands together in homage, they should honor those dharmabhāṇakas by making offerings to them of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, divine flags, the sound of music, food and drink—hard food and soft food—carriages, and supreme, divine heaps of jewels. They should offer heaps of divine jewels to those dharmabhāṇakas. Why is that? It is because through this Dharma teaching being taught just once, through hearing it, countless, innumerable beings will quickly attain the highest, complete enlightenment.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Those who wish for the state of buddhahood,</p>
<p>Those who long for self-arising wisdom,</p>
<p>Those who keep to this way:</p>
<p>Those beings should be honored. {1}</p>
<p>“Those who wish for omniscience,</p>
<p>Who wonder how to attain it quickly,</p>
<p>Those who have obtained this sūtra,</p>
<p>Those who possess it, should be honored. {2}</p>
<p>“The ones who will read this sūtra</p>
<p>Because of their compassion for beings</p>
<p>Will have been sent by the Lord of the World</p>
<p>In order that beings may be guided. {3}</p>
<p>“Those who will possess this sūtra</p>
<p>Because of their compassion for beings</p>
<p>Will have forsaken a good rebirth,</p>
<p>And those courageous ones will come here. {4}</p>
<p>“Teaching in the later times</p>
<p>This unsurpassable sūtra,</p>
<p>Those ones who will appear</p>
<p>Will have power over rebirth. {5}</p>
<p>“Scatter jewels on those dharmabhāṇakas;</p>
<p>Make offerings to them of divine flowers</p>
<p>And all the perfumes of human beings,</p>
<p>And cover them with divine clothing. {6}</p>
<p>“Always place your hands together in homage,</p>
<p>As you would for the Lord of Jinas, the Self-Arisen One,</p>
<p>To the ones who possess this sūtra after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>In these later, extremely dreadful times. {7}</p>
<p>“In order to make offerings to the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who recite this sūtra just one time,</p>
<p>Give them food and drink—hard food and soft food—</p>
<p>And millions of residences, beds and seats, and clothing. {8}</p>
<p>“The ones who in the later times write out</p>
<p>This sūtra, possess it, and listen to it,</p>
<p>I will have sent to that human existence</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the tasks of the Tathāgata. {9}</p>
<p>“If there were a man who stood before me</p>
<p>And with a frowning face and with malice</p>
<p>Spoke unpleasant things to me for an entire eon,</p>
<p>Then that man would create vast bad karma. {10}</p>
<p>“I declare that even greater bad karma will be created</p>
<p>By those who speak unpleasantly and abusively</p>
<p>To those who possess this sūtra</p>
<p>And who are teaching this sūtra. {11}</p>
<p>“If a man were to stand before me and praise me</p>
<p>With his hands together in homage for an entire eon,</p>
<p>With many quintillions of verses</p>
<p>While seeking for this supreme enlightenment, {12}</p>
<p>“He would obtain great merit</p>
<p>Through praising me while feeling great joy.</p>
<p>The one who praises those dharmabhāṇakas</p>
<p>Will obtain a supremely greater amount of merit. {13}</p>
<p>“If someone were to make offerings</p>
<p>Of forms, sounds, tastes, divine textures,</p>
<p>And divine perfumes to images of the Buddha</p>
<p>For a hundred and eighty billion eons, {14}</p>
<p>“And if the one who offered to those images</p>
<p>For a hundred and eighty billion eons</p>
<p>Were to hear this sūtra just one time,</p>
<p>That one would obtain a greater wonder. {15}</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, I declare to you, I proclaim to you that I, Bhaiṣajyarāja, have given, am giving, and will give many Dharma teachings, but from among all those many Dharma teachings, Bhaiṣajyarāja, it is this Dharma teaching that is unacceptable to the entire world, and which will not be believed by the entire world.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, this is the great secret from the higher knowledge of the Tathāgata that has been kept through the power of the Tathāgata and has not previously been revealed, has not previously been told. Bhaiṣajyarāja, many beings will reject this Dharma teaching while the Tathāgata lives, let alone after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, the noble men or noble women who, after I have passed into nirvāṇa, have faith in this Dharma teaching, read it, write it, honor it, and make others hear it, should be known to be wearing the Tathāgata’s Dharma robes. The tathāgatas who are present in other world realms will see them and bless them. They will have the power of their faith, the power of their roots of merit, and the power of their prayers.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, those noble men and noble women dwell in the same temple as the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata places his hand upon their heads.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, wherever this Dharma teaching is spoken, or taught, or written, or recited for oneself, or chanted for others, in that place, Bhaiṣajyarāja, one should build a great caitya of the Tathāgata that is made from precious materials. However, it is not necessary to place the relics of the Tathāgata within it. Why is that? It is because the relics of the Tathāgata have all been combined into one within it. The stūpa that is in that place where this Dharma teaching has been spoken, taught, recited for oneself, chanted for others, or written out and made into a text that is kept there, should be honored, venerated, shown respect, and offerings made to it. One should make offerings of all flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, parasols, banners, flags, banners of victory, songs, music, dance, and the sounds of musical instruments, and of percussion instruments.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, the beings who come to that caitya of the Tathāgata in order to pay homage to it, or to see it, should all be known, Bhaiṣajyarāja, to be close to the highest, complete enlightenment. Why is that? Bhaiṣajyarāja, many bodhisattvas, both householders and renunciants, even though they have practiced bodhisattva conduct, have never encountered listening to, writing, or making offerings to this kind of Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, as long as they have not heard this Dharma teaching they are not skilled in bodhisattva conduct. When they listen to and hear this Dharma teaching, and aspire to it, engage in it, understand it, and possess it, then at that time they have come near to the highest, complete enlightenment—they are close to it.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, it is like this: There is a man who wants water and is searching for it. In order to find water, he digs a well in an arid land. While he is digging, but sees that the soil being dug out is dry and pale, he will know, ‘The water is still farther down than this.’ But when, at another time, that man digs out wet earth and mud dripping with water, and sees that the bodies of men digging the well are covered in mud, that man, Bhaiṣajyarāja, will take those sights as a sign, and without any uncertainty or doubt he will think, ‘The water is near.’</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, in that way, while bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not hear, do not possess, do not comprehend, do not practice, and do not contemplate this Dharma teaching, those bodhisattva mahāsattvas are far from the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, when the bodhisattva mahāsattvas hear, possess, comprehend, practice, recite, contemplate, and meditate on this Dharma teaching, at that time they are near to the highest, complete enlightenment. Why is that? It is because this Dharma teaching is the supreme elucidation of the teachings that have an implied meaning of the secret aspect of the Dharma taught by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas so that the bodhisattva mahāsattvas may attain complete accomplishment.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, if a bodhisattva is frightened of this Dharma teaching, is afraid and terrified of it, then you should know that bodhisattva to be new to the Bodhisattva­yāna. Also, if a follower of the Śrāvakayāna is frightened of this Dharma teaching, is afraid and terrified of it, then, Bhaiṣajyarāja, you should know that this individual who is following the Śrāvakayāna is conceited.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, if in the later times, after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, a bodhisattva mahāsattva teaches this Dharma teaching to the fourfold assembly, then, Bhaiṣajyarāja, that bodhisattva has entered the residence of the Tathāgata, wears the Dharma robe of the Tathāgata, sits upon the seat of the Tathāgata, and then teaches this Dharma teaching to the fourfold assembly.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, what is the residence of the Tathāgata? Bhaiṣajyarāja, it is the vihāra of love for all beings.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, what is the Dharma robe of the Tathāgata? Bhaiṣajyarāja, the Tathāgata’s Dharma robe is great patience and gentleness.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, what is the Dharma seat of the Tathāgata? Bhaiṣajyarāja, it is entering the emptiness of all phenomena.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, that noble man will sit upon the Dharma seat of the Tathāgata. Having sat there he will teach this Dharma teaching to the fourfold assembly. The bodhisattva without any lack of confidence will teach before the fourfold assembly, which is a gathering of bodhisattvas who have entered the Bodhisattva­yāna.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, I will be residing in another world realm but I will emanate to be that noble man’s assembly. I shall send emanations as bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas and upāsikās to listen to the Dharma. They will not turn away or reject that dharmabhāṇaka’s teaching. If he is in the forest, I will emanate as many devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas to listen to the Dharma.</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja, although I reside in another world realm I will reveal my face to that noble man. Whatever sentences and syllables of this Dharma teaching that are taught I will myself repeat and recite them.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Cast aside all hesitation</p>
<p>And listen to a sūtra such as this.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to hear it.</p>
<p>It is difficult to aspire to it. {16}</p>
<p>“It is like someone who wants water</p>
<p>And digs a well in arid land,</p>
<p>Who upon seeing dry soil</p>
<p>Keeps on digging deeper: {17}</p>
<p>“On seeing that, he thinks</p>
<p>The water is still far down.</p>
<p>The earth he sees dug out</p>
<p>Is a sign that the water is still far. {18}</p>
<p>“When he sees repeatedly</p>
<p>Earth that is wet and muddy,</p>
<p>When it is in that condition,</p>
<p>It means the water is not far. {19}</p>
<p>“The wisdom of buddhahood</p>
<p>Is similarly far away</p>
<p>When this sūtra has not been heard</p>
<p>Or meditated on repeatedly. {20}</p>
<p>“When this profound,</p>
<p>Definitive king of the sūtras</p>
<p>Of the śrāvakas is heard</p>
<p>And contemplated repeatedly, {21}</p>
<p>“Then those wise ones are near</p>
<p>To the wisdom of buddhahood,</p>
<p>Just like earth that is wet</p>
<p>Means that water is near. {22}</p>
<p>“Enter the residence of the Jina</p>
<p>And wear my Dharma robe.</p>
<p>Be seated upon my seat</p>
<p>And teach this sūtra fearlessly. {23}</p>
<p>“The power of love is the residence.</p>
<p>Patience and gentleness is the robe.</p>
<p>Emptiness is my seat.</p>
<p>Sit upon it and teach. {24}</p>
<p>“If while teaching one is attacked</p>
<p>With clods of earth, sticks, knives,</p>
<p>Or with abuse and threats,</p>
<p>It will be endured by remembering me. {25}</p>
<p>“In an enduring body</p>
<p>In billions of realms</p>
<p>I teach the Dharma to beings</p>
<p>For countless millions of eons. {26}</p>
<p>“After I have passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>When there is a hero</p>
<p>Who will give the teaching of this sūtra</p>
<p>I will send there many emanations. {27}</p>
<p>“Those bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,</p>
<p>Upāsakas and upāsikās</p>
<p>Will make offerings to him</p>
<p>And the assembly will rejoice. {28}</p>
<p>“Those who come with clods and sticks,</p>
<p>And likewise abuse and threats,</p>
<p>Whatever it is that they try to do</p>
<p>They will be prevented by my emanations. {29}</p>
<p>“If one is staying alone,</p>
<p>Chanting this by himself</p>
<p>In an uninhabited place</p>
<p>In the forest or the mountains, {30}</p>
<p>“I will manifest there</p>
<p>My shining body</p>
<p>And I will correct</p>
<p>Any error in his recitation. {31}</p>
<p>“When one stays alone,</p>
<p>Living in the forest,</p>
<p>I shall send devas and yakṣas</p>
<p>In great numbers to be his companions. {32}</p>
<p>“He who teaches the fourfold assembly</p>
<p>Will have such qualities as these.</p>
<p>I will see him performing his recitation</p>
<p>As he stays alone in the forest and mountains. {33}</p>
<p>“He will have unimpeded eloquence</p>
<p>And will know many Dharma definitions.</p>
<p>He will satisfy billions of beings</p>
<p>Through the blessing of the Buddha. {34}</p>
<p>“Those beings who rely upon him</p>
<p>Will all quickly become bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>All who depend upon associating with him</p>
<p>Will see buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.” {35}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Dharmabhāṇakas,” the tenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Appearance of the Stūpa</p>
<p>Chapter 11</p>
<p>Then a stūpa made of the seven precious materials arose from the center of the assembly, directly in front of the Bhagavān. It was five hundred yojanas tall and of a corresponding circumference. Having risen up, it remained suspended in the air, bright and beautiful, adorned with five thousand encircling railings covered in flowers, and beautified by many thousands of toraṇas, hung with thousands of sacred flags and banners of victory, hung with thousands of strings of jewels, hung with thousands of streamers and bells, and emitting the aroma of bay leaves and sandalwood. That aroma spread throughout the entire all-containing world. Its crowning parasol reached as high as the palaces in the paradises of the Four Mahārājas. It was made of the seven precious materials, which are gold, silver, beryl, white coral, emerald, red pearl, and chrysoberyl. At the stūpa, devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise scattered coral tree and great coral tree flowers on the precious stūpa, bestrewing it with them, and covering it with them.</p>
<p>These words came from the precious stūpa: “The tathāgatas have no thinking, no thoughts, and manifest all modes of conducts. The tathāgatas do not originate from skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas. They do not come into being from karma, kleśas, parents, and the primary elements. They have no connection with flesh, blood, and veins.</p>
<p>They have no inhalation, no exhalation, and no connection with life. The tathāgatas are the same as space; they are not permanent and not impermanent. However, the tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, who passed into nirvāṇa many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago, who is free of thoughts and ideas, is seen for the sake of beings, through the power of his previous prayers, in order that the Dharma be heard and in order to ripen beings, but the body of the Tathāgata is without the slightest thought. The tathāgatas do not speak even a single syllable. The beings who are guided hear the teaching of the Dharma from the tathāgatas in accord with their individual natures and their individual aspirations. A tathāgata is the true nature, and that true nature is the limit of reality. That limit of reality is the essence of phenomena. That true nature, limit of reality, and essence of phenomena is the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. When the completely pure tathāgatas come, are seen, and speak, through the power of their previous prayers they teach the great skillful method of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to completely pure beings.”</p>
<p>Then the precious stūpa also said: “It is excellent, excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you have taught well the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. It is thus, Bhagavān. It is thus, Sugata!” Those are the words that were emitted.</p>
<p>The fourfold assembly became happy, delighted, joyful, and overjoyed on seeing that precious stūpa that remained suspended in the air. At that time they rose from their seats and stood with palms together in homage.</p>
<p>At that time, the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Mahāpratibhāna, seeing that the world with its devas, humans, and asuras was astonished, asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what is the cause of the appearance of such a great precious stūpa as this? What are the conditions for its appearance? Bhagavān, who uttered the words that came from this great precious stūpa?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, “Mahāpratibhāna, inside this great precious stūpa there is the complete body of a tathāgata. This is his stūpa. He uttered those words.</p>
<p>“Mahāpratibhāna, in the eastern direction, beyond countless thousands of worlds, there is a world named Ratnaviśuddhā. In that realm there appeared the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna. That bhagavān made a prayer. He said, ‘In the past when I was practicing bodhisattva conduct, the highest, complete enlightenment did not arise while I had not heard the instruction to bodhisattvas, the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. After I had heard this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, I attained the highest, complete enlightenment.’ Mahāpratibhāna, when the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna was about to pass into nirvāṇa, he said to the world and its devas who were before him, ‘Bhikṣus, when I have passed into nirvāṇa, a great precious stūpa that contains my body should be made.’ Mahāpratibhāna, then the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made this resolution: ‘This stūpa that is mine, the stūpa that contains my body, may it appear within the buddha realms in world realms in the ten directions wherever this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma will be taught. When those buddha bhagavāns are giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, may it be suspended in the air above the circle of the assembly. May the stūpa that contains my body congratulate the Buddha Bhagavān who is giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.’</p>
<p>“Therefore, Mahāpratibhāna, this is the stūpa that contains the body of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, which on my giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in this world realm, Sahā, has appeared from the middle of the circle of the assembly, remained suspended in the air, and congratulated me.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, through your power let us see the body of the tathāgata.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, “Mahāpratibhāna, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna made a momentous prayer. This was his prayer: ‘When buddha bhagavāns in other realms are giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, may the stūpa that contains my body come into the presence of those tathāgatas in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. When those buddha bhagavāns wish to expose my body and reveal it to the fourfold assembly, then may those tathāgatas assemble together all the emanations from their own bodies that are in the form of tathāgatas in the ten directions, each in their own buddha realm, each with their own name, and teaching the Dharma in those buddha realms. Then afterward, together with those emanations from their own bodies in the forms of tathāgatas, may they open the stūpa that contains my body and reveal it to the fourfold assembly.’</p>
<p>“Therefore, Mahāpratibhāna, I shall gather here all my many emanations in the form of tathāgatas teaching the Dharma to beings in other buddha realms in thousands of other world realms.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we shall pay homage to all those tathāgatas that are emanations from the Tathāgata’s own body.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān emitted a ray of light from his ūrṇā hair. The instant that ray of light shone forth, all those buddha bhagavāns that resided in the eastern direction in hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers were revealed. The buddha realms with their grounds made of crystal, beautified by trees made of precious materials, adorned by wreaths of calico and silk, filled with many hundred thousands of bodhisattvas, overspread with canopies, and covered with a network of gold and the seven precious materials were revealed. The bhagavāns teaching the Dharma with their mellifluous and gentle voices to beings in those realms were revealed. The hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas who filled those realms were revealed.</p>
<p>In the same way in the southeast, in the same way in the south, in the same way in the southwest, in the same way in the west, in the same way in the northwest, in the same way in the north, in the same way in the northeast, in the same way above, in the same way below—in each of the ten directions—all of those many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers, who were in many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers, were revealed.</p>
<p>Those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in the ten directions each instructed their own multitude of bodhisattvas, “Noble youths, I should go to the Sahā world realm, into the presence of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni, so that I may pay homage to the stūpa that contains the body of the tathāgata Prabhūtaratna!”</p>
<p>So those buddha bhagavāns, accompanied by either one or two of their own attendants, came to this Sahā world realm.</p>
<p>At that time this all-containing Sahā world realm became adorned by precious trees. Its ground became made of beryl and was covered with a network of the seven precious materials and of gold. It became perfumed by very precious incense and perfumes. It became strewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers. It became adorned with strings of little bells. It became divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords. There were no longer any villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, which are the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. There were no rivers or great rivers that were present there. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama. At that time, apart from those who were in that assembly, all beings that had been born into the six classes of existence in this Sahā world realm were transferred to other world realms.</p>
<p>The buddha bhagavāns with their one or two attendants then arrived in this Sahā world realm. Having arrived, the tathāgatas approached the bases of precious trees and stayed there. Each of those precious trees was five hundred yojanas high, with branches, leaves, and petals in succession at their extremities. They were perfectly adorned with flowers and fruit. A lion throne had been arranged at the foot of each precious tree. They were five hundred yojanas in height and adorned with huge jewels. Each of the tathāgatas sat cross-legged upon one. In that way, tathāgatas sat cross-legged at the foot of all the precious trees in all the worlds in this world realm of a billion worlds.</p>
<p>At that time all the worlds in this world realm of a billion worlds were filled with tathāgatas, but all the emanations of the body of the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni had not yet come even from just one direction.</p>
<p>The tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni now manifested places for the bodies of the tathāgatas who were coming and arriving. In all ten directions there were two hundred thousand million buddha realms made of beryl, covered with a network made of the seven precious materials and of gold, adorned with strings of little bells, strewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers, overspread with canopies, hung with divine flower garlands, and perfumed by divine incense and perfume.</p>
<p>In those two hundred thousand million buddha realms there were no villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. There were no rivers or great rivers. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama.</p>
<p>All those buddha realms were created as if they were one buddha realm, as if they were one land, which was flat, delightful, and adorned by trees made of the seven precious materials. Those trees were five hundred yojanas high, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit in succession at their extremities. Arranged at the foot of all those precious trees there were magnificent, beautiful lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height and were made from divine jewels. The tathāgatas who came and arrived sat cross-legged on the lion thrones in front of those trees. In this way, moreover, Śākyamuni purified two hundred thousand million buddha realms in each direction in order to create space for the tathāgatas who were coming and arriving.</p>
<p>In those two hundred thousand million world realms in each direction there were no villages, towns, market towns, districts, countries, or capitals. There were no Kāla mountain ranges. There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda Mountains. There were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain ranges. There were no Sumerus, the kings of mountains. There were no other great mountains or mountains. There were no great oceans. There were no rivers or great rivers. There were no devas, asuras, or humans. There were no hells, animals, or realm of Yama. Those beings had been transferred to other world realms.</p>
<p>Those buddha realms were made of beryl, covered with a network made of the seven precious materials and of gold, adorned with strings of little bells, completely bestrewn with coral tree and great coral tree flowers, overspread with divine canopies, hung with divine flower garlands, perfumed by divine incense and perfume, and adorned by trees made of the seven precious materials. Those trees were five hundred yojanas high, and lion thrones that were five hundred yojanas in height were also manifested. The tathāgatas sat cross-legged on those lion thrones in front of those precious trees.</p>
<p>It was then that the tathāgatas emanated by Bhagavān Śākyamuni who had been in the eastern direction, teaching the Dharma in hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms as numerous as the grains of sand in ten million Ganges Rivers, arrived. In the same way they came and arrived from the ten directions and were seated in the eight directions.</p>
<p>At that time those tathāgatas in each of the eight directions arrived in three hundred million world realms. Then those tathāgatas each sat on their own lion throne and sent their own attendants carrying a basket of precious flowers to Bhagavān Śākyamuni. They said to them, “Noble men, go to the Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha. Pay homage to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and with my words ask him and his host of bodhisattvas, and host of śrāvakas, ‘Are you untroubled? Are you well? Are you strong? Are you constantly happy?’ Then scatter upon him this heap of jewels and say, ‘The Bhagavān expresses his wish that the Tathāgata’s precious stūpa be opened.’ ”</p>
<p>All the tathāgatas sent their attendants in that way. Then the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni, knowing that the entirety of his emanations was assembled, knowing that they were seated on their lion thrones, knowing that the attendants of the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas had all arrived, and knowing that those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas had expressed their wish, rose up from his Dharma seat and remained floating up in the air. The entire fourfold assembly also rose from their seats and stood with hands together in homage, gazing upon the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān, with the fingers of his right hand, opened the center of the great precious stūpa that was floating in the air. He opened it and separated two parts of the wall panels, as when the two great doors of a great city’s gate separate after the bolt has been removed.</p>
<p>In that way, the Bhagavān, with the fingers of his right hand, opened the center of the great precious stūpa and revealed its interior. As soon as the great precious stūpa of the Tathāgata was opened the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna could be seen, his whole body withered, seated cross-legged and upright on a lion throne as if he was in meditation. He said, “It is excellent, excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you have taught well the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. It is excellent, Bhagavān Śākyamuni, that you are giving the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. Bhagavān, I have come here to listen to the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The fourfold assembly was amazed and astonished on seeing the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons before, speaking.</p>
<p>At that time, heaps of human and divine jewels were tossed toward the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni. Then the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna offered half the lion throne seat to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and from within the great precious stūpa said, “Sit here, Bhagavān Tathāgata Śākyamuni.”</p>
<p>So the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni sat on that half of the lion throne together with that tathāgata. Both tathāgatas could be seen seated in the center of the great precious stūpa that remained suspended in the air.</p>
<p>The fourfold assembly now thought, “We are far from these tathāgatas; may we also rise up into the air through the power of the tathāgatas!”</p>
<p>At this, the Bhagavān, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the fourfold assembly, at that time, through his miraculous power, suspended the fourfold assembly up in the air.</p>
<p>The bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni then asked the fourfold assembly, “Bhikṣus, who among you in this Sahā world realm has the enthusiasm to give the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma? This is the moment. This is the time. You are in the presence of the Buddha. Having bestowed the Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, the Tathāgata wishes to enter nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, this great rishi, who is in nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The Guide who entered this precious stūpa,</p>
<p>Has come in order to listen to this Dharma.</p>
<p>Who would not have diligence for the Dharma? {1}</p>
<p>“He entered nirvāṇa millions of eons ago</p>
<p>But still he listens to the Dharma.</p>
<p>He goes here and there for the Dharma;</p>
<p>This kind of Dharma is very difficult to find. {2}</p>
<p>“It was the prayer of this Guide,</p>
<p>While he practiced in his previous lives,</p>
<p>That even after nirvāṇa he would seek the Dharma</p>
<p>Throughout all ten directions in all these worlds. {3}</p>
<p>“All of these who are from my own body,</p>
<p>As numerous as the sands of ten billion Ganges,</p>
<p>Have come in order to accomplish service for the Dharma</p>
<p>And to see this Lord who has passed into nirvāṇa. {4}</p>
<p>“They all left behind their own realms,</p>
<p>And likewise all their śrāvakas, humans, and maruts,</p>
<p>In order that they may preserve this good Dharma,</p>
<p>For this way of Dharma to remain for a long time. {5}</p>
<p>“Through my miraculous power I purified</p>
<p>Many thousands of millions of world realms</p>
<p>And transferred the beings there elsewhere,</p>
<p>In order that these buddhas could be seated. {6}</p>
<p>“I acted with such dedication so that</p>
<p>This way of the Dharma may be taught.</p>
<p>These countless buddhas are now seated</p>
<p>At the foot of trees like a multitude of lotuses. {7}</p>
<p>“The guides are seated upon lion thrones</p>
<p>At the foot of no fewer than millions of trees.</p>
<p>Very beautiful, they sit there constantly,</p>
<p>Like a fire in a great darkness. {8}</p>
<p>“The beautiful aroma of the guides of the world</p>
<p>Spreads throughout the ten directions</p>
<p>So that as the breeze blows</p>
<p>It pervades these beings here. {9}</p>
<p>“Those who wish to hold this Dharma teaching</p>
<p>After I have passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Should quickly state their intention</p>
<p>In the presence of the lords of the world. {10}</p>
<p>“The buddha who has entered nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The muni Prabhūtaratna, also</p>
<p>Is someone who is dedicated</p>
<p>To listening to this lion’s roar. {11}</p>
<p>“Secondly I, and the many millions</p>
<p>Of these guides who have come here,</p>
<p>Will with dedication listen to a child of the jinas</p>
<p>Who with enthusiasm teaches this Dharma. {12}</p>
<p>“It is because of this that offerings are always being made</p>
<p>To me and Prabhūtaratna, the self-arisen Jina.</p>
<p>He is one who is constantly going in every direction</p>
<p>In order to listen to such a Dharma as this. {13}</p>
<p>“The lords of the world who have arrived here,</p>
<p>Who have made brilliant and beautiful the land,</p>
<p>Will receive vast and not little offerings</p>
<p>Through their teaching of the sūtra. {14}</p>
<p>“This bhagavān residing inside the stūpa,</p>
<p>And I who am upon this seat,</p>
<p>And these many other lords of the world,</p>
<p>Arrived from many hundreds of realms, are seen. {15}</p>
<p>“Noble ones, I ask you to contemplate,</p>
<p>Out of compassion for all beings,</p>
<p>This extremely difficult task</p>
<p>That the guides have enthusiasm for. {16}</p>
<p>“If someone had to give the teaching</p>
<p>Of many thousands of sūtras</p>
<p>As numerous as the sands of the Ganges,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task. {17}</p>
<p>“If someone had to grasp</p>
<p>Mount Sumeru in their hand</p>
<p>And throw it into millions of realms,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task. {18}</p>
<p>“If someone had to dislodge</p>
<p>This realm of a billion worlds with their big toe,</p>
<p>And kick it into millions of realms,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task. {19}</p>
<p>“If someone had to teach the Dharma</p>
<p>Through thousands of other sūtras</p>
<p>While residing at the summit of existence,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task. {20}</p>
<p>“If someone upholds this sūtra</p>
<p>In the dreadful future times</p>
<p>After the Lord of the World’s nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>That will be a very difficult task. {21}</p>
<p>“If someone had to grasp in their hand</p>
<p>The entire element of space,</p>
<p>And having grasped it, go away,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task. {22}</p>
<p>“If someone writes out a sūtra like this</p>
<p>In the dreadful future times</p>
<p>When I have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>That will be a very difficult task. {23}</p>
<p>“If someone had to insert into their fingernail</p>
<p>The entire element of earth,</p>
<p>And having done so, go away</p>
<p>And climb up to the world of Brahmā, {24}</p>
<p>“And does that difficult task</p>
<p>In front of the entire world,</p>
<p>That would not be a very difficult task,</p>
<p>And would not take such great dedication. {25}</p>
<p>“Far more difficult than that</p>
<p>Would be if someone were to recite</p>
<p>This sūtra in the future times</p>
<p>When I have passed into nirvāṇa. {26}</p>
<p>“It would not be difficult in this world</p>
<p>For someone in the inferno of the eon’s end</p>
<p>To go into its center, carrying a load</p>
<p>Of straw, without its burning. {27}</p>
<p>“Far more difficult will be</p>
<p>If someone after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Is a holder of this sūtra</p>
<p>And makes one being hear it. {28}</p>
<p>“If someone were a holder of the collection</p>
<p>Of eighty-four thousand dharmas</p>
<p>And were to teach them to millions of beings</p>
<p>Together with the transmission of instructions, {29}</p>
<p>And were at that time to guide</p>
<p>The bhikṣus who are my śrāvakas</p>
<p>And establish them in the higher knowledges,</p>
<p>Then that would not be difficult. {30}</p>
<p>“It will be far more difficult</p>
<p>For someone to uphold this sūtra,</p>
<p>To have faith in and aspiration for it,</p>
<p>And teach it again and again. {31}</p>
<p>“If someone were to establish in arhathood</p>
<p>Many thousands of millions</p>
<p>Of those with great good fortune, who have the six higher knowledges,</p>
<p>As numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, {32}</p>
<p>“The one who after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Upholds this excellent sūtra</p>
<p>Will be a supreme human</p>
<p>Who accomplishes a far greater activity. {33}</p>
<p>“I have taught many dharmas</p>
<p>Within thousands of world realms,</p>
<p>And I am teaching again now</p>
<p>For the sake of the wisdom of buddhahood. {34}</p>
<p>“From among all sūtras,</p>
<p>This is said to be the supreme sūtra.</p>
<p>The one who upholds this sūtra</p>
<p>Is holding the body of the Jina. {35}</p>
<p>“Noble ones, whoever among you</p>
<p>Aspires to uphold this sūtra</p>
<p>In the later times, say so</p>
<p>In the presence of the Tathāgata. {36}</p>
<p>“If someone upholds, even for a moment,</p>
<p>This sūtra which is so difficult to uphold,</p>
<p>They will have completely brought</p>
<p>Great pleasure to all the lords of the world. {37}</p>
<p>“They will be highly praised</p>
<p>By all the lords of the world.</p>
<p>Those heroes, those mighty ones, will soon</p>
<p>Attain higher knowledge and enlightenment. {38}</p>
<p>“Whoever upholds this sūtra,</p>
<p>Will be a true child of the lords of the worlds.</p>
<p>That one will be the carrier of their burden,</p>
<p>And will have attained the state of pacification. {39}</p>
<p>“The one who teaches this sūtra</p>
<p>After the nirvāṇa of the chief of humans</p>
<p>Will become the eyes for the world</p>
<p>With its humans and maruts. {40}</p>
<p>“The one who in the later times</p>
<p>Teaches this sūtra for just a moment,</p>
<p>That wise one will be worthy</p>
<p>Of homage by all beings.” {41}</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān instructed the entire host of bodhisattvas, and the world with its devas and asuras, saying, “Bhikṣus, in the past, in a time gone by, I sought The Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Good Dharma, without weariness, without fatigue, for countless, innumerable eons. In the past, for many hundreds of thousands of eons I was a king who prayed for the highest, complete enlightenment and my mind never wavered from that. I was dedicated to fulfilling the six perfections. I performed immeasurable acts of generosity, giving away gold, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, corals, refined gold, silver, emeralds, white coral, red pearls, village towns, market towns, districts, lands, capitals, wives, sons, daughters, male slaves, female slaves, elephants, horses, chariots, and so on, up to my own body—my hands, feet, head, limbs, smaller body parts—and my life. I never had any clinging arise in my mind.</p>
<p>“At that time, life in this world was long. One lived for many hundreds of thousands of years. During that time I was a king for the sake of the Dharma and not for the sake of dominion. I consecrated my oldest son to be king and dedicated myself to searching in the four directions for the highest Dharma.</p>
<p>“I rang a bell and announced, ‘I will become the slave of anyone who will give me the highest Dharma and teach me its meaning!’</p>
<p>“At that time there was a rishi who said to me, ‘Great King, I have the Dharma teaching of the supreme sūtra called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. If you promise to be my slave I will enable you to hear it.’</p>
<p>“When I heard the words of the rishi I was happy, content, delighted, and overjoyed, and I approached that rishi and said to him, ‘I will do whatever work a slave would do for you!’</p>
<p>“In that way I promised to be that rishi’s slave and then I did the work of collecting straw, wood, water, roots, tubers, fruit, and so on. I was even the guard at his door. I did that kind of work during the day and at night I grasped the feet of his bed. However, I never had any physical fatigue and I never had any mental fatigue.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, in order to make this clear, the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“I remember how in past eons</p>
<p>I was a Dharma king for the sake of the Dharma.</p>
<p>I became a king for the sake of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Not for pleasures but for the supreme Dharma. {42}</p>
<p>“I made this declaration in the four directions:</p>
<p>‘I shall be the slave of whoever teaches me the Dharma.’</p>
<p>At that time there was a wise rishi</p>
<p>Who taught the sūtra called The Good Dharma. {43}</p>
<p>“He said to me, ‘If you wish for the Dharma,</p>
<p>Promise to be my slave and I will teach you the Dharma.’</p>
<p>When I heard those words, I was overjoyed</p>
<p>And I worked for him as his slave. {44}</p>
<p>“When I worked as his slave for the Dharma</p>
<p>My body and mind were untouched by fatigue.</p>
<p>At that time my prayers were for beings</p>
<p>And not for myself nor for my desires. {45}</p>
<p>“That king had that degree of dedication,</p>
<p>That for a full thousand eons, without weariness,</p>
<p>He did no other work in the ten directions</p>
<p>Until he obtained that which was called the Dharma. {46}</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, what do you think? If you have the thought that at that time, on that occasion, the king was someone else, do not see it in that way. Why is that? At that time, on that occasion, I was that king. Bhikṣus, if you have the thought that at that time, on that occasion, the rishi was someone else, do not see it in that way. Why is that? Bhikṣus, at that time, on that occasion, this Devadatta was that rishi.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, Devadatta was my kalyāṇamitra, and relying on that kalyāṇamitra I fulfilled the six perfections. It was through relying upon Devadatta that I perfected great love, great compassion, great rejoicing, great equanimity, the thirty-two signs and eighty features of a great being, a fathom-wide aura, a golden color, the ten strengths, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of attracting disciples, the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha, the great miraculous powers, and the liberating of beings in the ten directions.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, I declare to you, I make it known to you, this Devadatta, bhikṣus, will in a future time, after countless innumerable eons, in a world realm named Devasopānāyā be the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Devarāja.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, the lifespan of Tathāgata Devarāja will be twenty intermediate eons long and he will teach the Dharma extensively. Beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges will eliminate the kleśas and manifest arhathood. Many beings will develop the aspiration to enlightenment. Beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges will develop the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment and attain irreversible patience.</p>
<p>“Bhikṣus, after Tathāgata Devarāja has passed into nirvāṇa, the Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons. The relic of his body will not be divided but remain as one whole that will be placed inside a stūpa made of the seven precious materials. That stūpa will be sixty yojanas high and forty yojanas wide. All devas and humans will make offerings to it of incense, perfume, flowers, garlands, ointments, powders, cloths, parasols, banners, flags, banners of victory, and so on, and they will praise it in song.</p>
<p>“Whoever will circumambulate that stūpa or bow down to it will manifest the supreme result of arhathood, some will attain pratyeka­buddhahood, and countless, innumerable devas and humans will develop an irreversible aspiration to the highest, supreme enlightenment.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān then said to the bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, in future times, noble men or noble women who listen to this chapter from The Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Good Dharma, and having heard it have no doubt, and with pure minds are dedicated to it, will close the doorway to the lower existences. They will not be reborn in the hells, as an animal, or in the realm of Yama. They will be reborn in the buddha realms in the ten directions and in lifetime after lifetime will hear this sūtra. If they are reborn in a deva or human world they will have a superior status. Whatever buddha realm they are born into, they will be born miraculously in front of the Tathāgata from within a lotus made of the seven precious materials.”</p>
<p>At that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa, who had come from the buddha realm of Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna that was in the downward direction, said to Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, “Bhagavān, let us return to our own buddha realm.”</p>
<p>But the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, “Noble one, stay a little while, gain some ascertainment of the Dharma with my bodhisattva mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, and then after that return to your buddha realm.”</p>
<p>At that time, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, who was seated upon a lotus that had a thousand petals and was the size of a cartwheel, and who was encircled by many bodhisattvas, rose from the palace of the nāga king Sāgara within the ocean high into the sky and floated through the sky to Vulture Peak Mountain, into the presence of the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta descended from the lotus and bowed his head to the feet of Bhagavān Śākyamuni and Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna. He then approached the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, spoke with the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa about many pleasant and joyful things, and then sat down to one side.</p>
<p>The bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa then asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, how many beings have you guided since you entered the ocean?”</p>
<p>“I have guided countless, innumerable beings of a number that it is not possible to describe in words or to conceive of in the mind,” answered Mañjuśrī. “Noble one, stay a little while until you see an omen.”</p>
<p>As soon as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said those words, many thousands of lotuses rose up into the sky from within the oceans. Many thousands of bodhisattvas were seated upon those lotuses. Then those bodhisattvas came through the sky to Vulture Peak and remained suspended in the sky above it. Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta had guided all of them toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those bodhisattvas who had previously entered the Mahāyāna praised the six perfections and the qualities of the Mahāyāna, while the bodhisattvas who had previously been śrāvakas praised the Śrāvakayāna. All of them knew the qualities of the Mahāyāna and the emptiness of all phenomena.</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said to the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa, “Noble one, since I entered the ocean I have guided all these beings that have appeared here.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta questions by chanting these verses:</p>
<p>“Great excellent one, who describes wisdom through parables,</p>
<p>You who are the god of humans, I ask you to tell me</p>
<p>Through whose power have you become</p>
<p>Someone who today has guided countless beings? {47}</p>
<p>“What sūtra teaches the path to enlightenment?</p>
<p>What is the Dharma that you have taught,</p>
<p>That by hearing it they developed the aspiration for enlightenment</p>
<p>And have definitely attained profundity within omniscience?” {48}</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī answered, “In the ocean I taught The Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Good Dharma and nothing else.”</p>
<p>“This sūtra is profound, subtle, and difficult to see,” said Prajñākūṭa. “There is no other sūtra that is its equal. Is there a being who is able to comprehend this sūtra jewel and attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood?”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” answered Mañjuśrī, “there is the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, who was born eight years ago. She has great wisdom, sharp faculties. The actions of her body, speech, and mind are preceded by wisdom. She has attained the retention by which she remembers the words and meaning of the teachings of all tathāgatas. She has attained in an instant a thousand samādhis of meditation on all phenomena and all beings. She has irreversible aspiration for enlightenment. She has made vast prayers. She cares for all beings as she would for herself. She can develop qualities and never lose them. She has a smiling face. She has a perfect, magnificent complexion. She has a loving mind. She speaks with compassion. She is able to attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.”</p>
<p>Prajñākūṭa said, “I have seen that when the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni had become a bodhisattva dedicated to attaining enlightenment, he generated much merit, and his diligence never weakened throughout thousands of eons. There is nowhere throughout the worlds of the realm of a billion worlds, not even a place the size of a mustard seed, where he has not given up his own body for the sake of beings. Only after all that did he attain the enlightenment of buddhahood. Who can believe that the daughter of Sāgara could attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in an instant?”</p>
<p>Then at that time the daughter of Sāgara, the king of the nāgas, appeared before them. She bowed her head to the feet of the Bhagavān, sat down on one side, and recited these verses:</p>
<p>“His merit, that merit is profound,</p>
<p>And pervades every direction.</p>
<p>His subtle body is adorned</p>
<p>By the thirty-two signs. {49}</p>
<p>“He has the excellent features.</p>
<p>All beings pay homage to him.</p>
<p>All beings come to him</p>
<p>Like they do to a market town. {50}</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata is my witness</p>
<p>That my wish is for enlightenment.</p>
<p>I will teach extensively</p>
<p>The Dharma that liberates from suffering.” {51}</p>
<p>At that time Śāriputra said to the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, “Noble lady, although you have an irreversible aspiration for enlightenment and immeasurable wisdom, it will be difficult for you to attain enlightenment. Noble lady, a woman may maintain diligence, create merit for many thousands of eons, and complete the six perfections, but still she will not attain buddhahood. Why is that? It is because a woman has still not attained five states. What are these five? The first is the state of being a Brahmā, the second is the state of being a Śakra, the third is the state of being one of the four mahārājas, the fourth is the state of being a cakravartin, and the fifth is the state of being an irreversible bodhisattva.”</p>
<p>At that time, the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, had a jewel of the value of an entire realm of a billion worlds. The daughter of the nāga king offered it to the Bhagavān, and the Bhagavān accepted it out of compassion.</p>
<p>The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, then asked Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira Śāriputra, “Did the Bhagavān quickly accept the jewel that I offered to the Bhagavān, or not?”</p>
<p>“You offered it quickly and the Bhagavān accepted it quickly,” the sthavira answered.</p>
<p>The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, said, “Venerable Śāriputra, if I have great miraculous power, I will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood even more quickly than that jewel was accepted.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, in front of the entire world, and in front of Sthavira Śāriputra, the daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, manifested the vanishing of her female genitalia, the appearance of male genitalia, and her transformation into a bodhisattva.</p>
<p>That bodhisattva now went to the south and, in a southern world realm named Vimalā, manifested the attainment of perfect buddhahood while seated at the foot of a tree made of the seven precious materials.</p>
<p>That buddha had a body that possessed all thirty-two signs and the excellent features, and shone with a light that pervaded the ten directions as he gave the teaching of the Dharma. All beings in this Sahā world realm saw all the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans paying homage to that tathāgata and saw him teaching them the Dharma. All those beings who listened to that tathāgata’s Dharma teaching attained irreversible progress toward the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.</p>
<p>That Vimalā world realm and this Sahā world realm both shook in six ways. Three thousand beings within the circle of Bhagavān Śākyamuni’s assembly attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena, and three thousand received the prophecies of their attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>At this, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira Śāriputra fell silent.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Appearance of the Stūpa,” the eleventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>Chapter 12</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna, together with a following of two hundred thousand bodhisattvas, facing the Bhagavān, said, “Bhagavān, have no concern over this matter. Bhagavān, we will teach, we will expound this Dharma teaching to beings after the nirvāṇa of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, in that time beings will be wicked, have few roots of merit, be arrogant, be devoted to gain and honor, engage in roots of demerit, be difficult to guide, have no interest, and be filled with disinterest, but, Bhagavān, we will demonstrate the power of patience and in that time we will teach this sūtra, we will uphold it, we will expound it, we will write it out, we will honor it, we will venerate it, and we will make offerings to it. Bhagavān, we will cast aside body and life and teach this sūtra. Therefore, Bhagavān, have no concern.”</p>
<p>That assembly’s bhikṣus, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training, and the five hundred bhikṣus, then said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we too are resolved to teach this Dharma teaching and will do so in other world realms.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān gave prophecies of the highest, complete enlightenment to all the Bhagavān’s śrāvakas, both those in training and those who had passed beyond training. All the eight thousand bhikṣus, with their hands together in homage, bowed toward the Bhagavān and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, do not be concerned. In the later times, in the later era, after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we also will expound this Dharma teaching in other world realms. Why is that? Bhagavān, the beings in this Sahā world realm will be arrogant, with few roots of merit, constantly malicious, deceitful, and dishonest.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān’s maternal aunt Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and six thousand bhikṣuṇīs, both bhikṣuṇīs in training and those who had passed beyond training, now arose from their seats at the same time, with their hands together in homage, bowed toward the Bhagavān, and stood there gazing at the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, “Gautamī, do not stand gazing at the Tathāgata, unhappily thinking, ‘The Tathāgata has not spoken to me, has not prophesied the highest, complete enlightenment for me.’ For when I gave a prophecy to the entire assembly, you too, Gautamī, received a prophecy accordingly.</p>
<p>“Gautamī, from now on you will be a bodhisattva mahāsattva dharmabhāṇaka under thirty-eight hundred thousand quintillion buddhas. These six thousand bhikṣuṇīs, both bhikṣuṇīs in training and those who have passed beyond training, will be bodhisattva dharmabhāṇakas with you under those tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Beyond that and even further beyond that, you will complete your bodhisattva practice and appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana.</p>
<p>“Gautamī, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana will give a prophecy to those six thousand bodhisattvas of their successive attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment.”</p>
<p>Then the bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, thought, “The Bhagavān has not said my name.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān, knowing the thoughts that were in the mind of Bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, said to Bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, “Yaśodharā, I declare to you, I make it known to you, that you will be a bodhisattva dharmabhāṇaka under a hundred thousand million buddhas. You will eventually complete your bodhisattva practice and in the world realm named Bhadrā you will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Raśmi­śata­sahasra­paripūrṇa­dhvaja. The lifespan of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Raśmi­śata­sahasra­paripūrṇa­dhvaja will be immeasurable.”</p>
<p>At this, Bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and her following of six thousand bhikṣuṇīs, and Bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā and her following of four thousand bhikṣuṇīs, were astonished and amazed by obtaining from the Bhagavān the prophecy of their highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>At that time they recited this verse:</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, you are the Instructor, the Guide,</p>
<p>The Teacher of the world and its devas.</p>
<p>You bring relief and devas and humans make offerings to you.</p>
<p>And today we also, Lord, have been made content.” {1}</p>
<p>Having recited that verse, the bhikṣuṇīs said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we too are resolved to teach this Dharma teaching in a future time, in a future era, in other world realms.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān now looked toward the eighty thousand bodhisattvas who had attained retention and had turned the irreversible Dharma wheel.</p>
<p>As soon as the Bhagavān looked at them, those bodhisattva mahāsattvas rose from their seats. With their hands placed together in homage they bowed toward the Bhagavān and thought, “The Bhagavān is going to exhort us to teach this Dharma teaching.” At that thought, they all trembled and said to each other, “Noble ones, if the Bhagavān exhorts us to teach this Dharma teaching in the future times, how shall we respond?”</p>
<p>Then those noble ones, because of their veneration for the Bhagavān and because of their past practice and prayers, roared the lion’s roar in the presence of the Bhagavān. “Bhagavān, in the future time when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we will go into the ten directions, and through the power of the Bhagavān we will have beings write out this Dharma teaching, recite it, contemplate it, and teach it. And the Bhagavān, who will be residing in other world realms, will guard us, protect us, and hide us.”</p>
<p>Thereupon those bodhisattva mahāsattvas together spoke these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“Do not be concerned, Bhagavān!</p>
<p>After you have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>In the very dreadful later era</p>
<p>We will teach this supreme sūtra. {2}</p>
<p>“Guide, we will endure it,</p>
<p>We will bear it</p>
<p>When fools brandishing sticks</p>
<p>Abuse us and threaten us. {3}</p>
<p>“In the dreadful future era,</p>
<p>The fools will be deceitful,</p>
<p>Will lack understanding, will be dishonest and arrogant,</p>
<p>And will believe they have attainment when they do not. {4}</p>
<p>“With evil minds they will say,</p>
<p>‘We dwell in solitude,</p>
<p>Wear clothing made of patches,</p>
<p>And we practice renunciation.’ {5}</p>
<p>“Eager for tastes, and having attachment,</p>
<p>They will teach the Dharma to laypeople,</p>
<p>And they will be venerated</p>
<p>As if they had the six higher knowledges. {6}</p>
<p>“They will have anger and they will have hate.</p>
<p>Their thoughts will be on homes and wealth.</p>
<p>They will remain in solitude in the forest</p>
<p>And they will be maligning us. {7}</p>
<p>“They who are focused on gain and honor</p>
<p>Will speak in this way concerning us:</p>
<p>‘These bhikṣus are tīrthikas</p>
<p>Who teach what they have made up.’ {8}</p>
<p>“They will strongly malign us, saying,</p>
<p>‘They have created their own sūtra</p>
<p>In order to obtain gain and honor,</p>
<p>And teach it in the middle of assemblies.’ {9}</p>
<p>“In front of kings and princes,</p>
<p>And likewise the king’s ministers,</p>
<p>And brahmins and householders,</p>
<p>And also in front of other bhikṣus {10}</p>
<p>“They will speak ill of us,</p>
<p>Saying that we are tīrthikas.</p>
<p>We will endure it all</p>
<p>Through our veneration for the great Rishi. {11}</p>
<p>“Those who have evil minds</p>
<p>Will at that time mock us,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘They will become buddhas.’</p>
<p>But we will endure it all. {12}</p>
<p>“In the disturbed era of destruction,</p>
<p>The dreadful time of great fear,</p>
<p>Many bhikṣus in the form of yakṣas</p>
<p>Will condemn us. {13}</p>
<p>“Because of our veneration for the Lord of the World</p>
<p>We will be resolved to do that which is so difficult.</p>
<p>We will put on the armor of patience</p>
<p>And we will teach this sūtra. {14}</p>
<p>“Guide, we will have no concern</p>
<p>For our bodies or even our lives.</p>
<p>We will be dedicated to enlightenment</p>
<p>And preserving what you have bestowed on us. {15}</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān knows the nature</p>
<p>Of those wicked bhikṣus</p>
<p>Who will appear in the future times</p>
<p>And who will not understand the teaching with implied meaning. {16}</p>
<p>“We will endure all the frowns,</p>
<p>Being repeatedly abused,</p>
<p>Being expelled from temples,</p>
<p>Being bound, and many beatings. {17}</p>
<p>“We will remember in the later times</p>
<p>The instructions given by the Lord of the World,</p>
<p>And we will fearlessly teach this sūtra</p>
<p>In the middle of the assembly. {18}</p>
<p>“Guide, we shall go to the towns</p>
<p>And go to the villages</p>
<p>Where there are those who seek this,</p>
<p>And bestow on them what you have taught. {19}</p>
<p>“Lord of the World, great Muni,</p>
<p>We will be your emissaries.</p>
<p>You who have attained peace, excellent nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>You have no need to be concerned. {20}</p>
<p>“All who are lamps for the world</p>
<p>Come from the ten directions;</p>
<p>We are speaking words of truth</p>
<p>And you know our aspiration.” {21}</p>
<p>This concludes “Resolutions,” the twelfth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Dwelling in Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 13</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what these bodhisattva mahāsattvas are resolved to do because of their reverence for the Bhagavān is a difficult task, extremely difficult. Bhagavān, how should these bodhisattva mahāsattvas expound this Dharma teaching in the later times, in a later era?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas should expound this Dharma teaching in the later times, in a later era, by maintaining four qualities. What are these four?</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas should expound this Dharma teaching in the later times, in a later era, by maintaining their practice and field of activity.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, in what way do bodhisattva mahāsattvas maintain their practice and field of activity?</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas are patient, self-controlled, have attained the level of self-control, and their minds are without anger or envy.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not practice within any phenomenon whatsoever. They see correctly the specific characteristics of those phenomena. They have no analysis or examination of those phenomena. That, Mañjuśrī, is what is called the practice of bodhisattva mahāsattvas.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, what is the bodhisattva mahāsattvas’ field of activity? Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas do not associate with a king, do not associate with, revere, serve, or visit princes, the king’s ministers, or the king’s courtiers. They do not associate with, revere, or serve those other practitioners, mendicants, beggars, and naked ones who are tīrthikas, nor those who teach poetry. They do not associate with, revere, serve, or become familiar with those who possess worldly mantras, nor with Lokāyatas. They do not frequent the company of caṇḍālas, swindlers, pig sellers, chicken sellers, deer hunters, fishermen, singers and dancers, musicians, or wrestlers. They do not frequent places of entertainment for others. They do not associate with them. Other than that, they teach the Dharma freely to them at those times when they approach them. They do not associate with, revere, serve, or become familiar with the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas and upāsikās who follow the Śrāvakayāna. They do not mingle with them either on their walkways or in their temples. Other than that, they teach the Dharma freely to them at those times when they approach them.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, that is the bodhisattva mahāsattvas’ field of activity.</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva mahāsattva does not constantly teach the Dharma to women while possessing one or another sign of attachment to them. He does not constantly desire to be looking at women. He does not approach families constantly thinking of teaching the Dharma to the women, the girls, and the wives, and does not delight in doing so. He does not teach the Dharma to paṇḍakas and does not become familiar with them, nor delight in them. He does not enter homes alone to procure alms, unless he is recollecting the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“If he does teach the Dharma to a woman, he does not even teach the Dharma with desire for the Dharma, let alone with desire for the woman. He teaches the Dharma without even revealing his teeth, let alone any obvious facial expression.</p>
<p>“He does not associate with śrāmaṇeras or śrāmaṇerīs, bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, young men or young women, and does not converse with them. He is someone who reveres isolation and always remains in isolation.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, that is the first field of activity of bodhisattva mahāsattvas.</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas see the emptiness of all phenomena—phenomena as they are, not as they are not—as they truly are, unwavering, unshakeable, immutable, unchanging, always as they truly are, having the nature of space, beyond definition and terminology, unborn, neither existing nor not existing, not composite, not continuous, spoken of through the word nonexistence, in an unimpeded state, and manifested from erroneous conceptualization.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas are always seeing phenomena in that way, and by remaining in that state, they maintain the bodhisattva mahāsattvas’ field of activity.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, that is the second field of activity of bodhisattva mahāsattvas.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān taught on this topic in detail, speaking these verses:</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas who wish</p>
<p>To give the teaching of this sūtra</p>
<p>With confidence and courage</p>
<p>In the later, terrifying times, {1}</p>
<p>“Should maintain their practice and field of activity:</p>
<p>They should be isolated and pure.</p>
<p>They should always abstain</p>
<p>From association with kings and princes. {2}</p>
<p>“They should have no association either</p>
<p>With those who are the king’s courtiers,</p>
<p>Nor at all with caṇḍālas, swindlers,</p>
<p>Or those who are tīrthikas. {3}</p>
<p>“They should not associate with arrogant bhikṣus,</p>
<p>Who follow vinaya and scripture</p>
<p>And conceive of themselves as arhats.</p>
<p>They should avoid those with poor conduct.</p>
<p>“They should always avoid bhikṣuṇīs</p>
<p>Whose behavior is talking and laughing.</p>
<p>They should also avoid the upāsikās</p>
<p>Who are evidently dissolute. {5}</p>
<p>“They should avoid association with</p>
<p>Those upāsikās who are seeking</p>
<p>For nirvāṇa within this lifetime.</p>
<p>This is what is called the practice. {6}</p>
<p>“The brave one should always teach</p>
<p>Confidently and freely</p>
<p>Those who come asking for the Dharma</p>
<p>For the sake of supreme enlightenment. {7}</p>
<p>“He should avoid association with</p>
<p>Beings who are women, or paṇḍakas.</p>
<p>He should also avoid families</p>
<p>That have brides and young women. {8}</p>
<p>“He should not delight those women,</p>
<p>Laughingly asking after their welfare.</p>
<p>He should avoid association</p>
<p>With pig farmers and shepherds. {9}</p>
<p>“He should avoid association</p>
<p>With those who will kill various creatures</p>
<p>For the sake of pleasure,</p>
<p>And those who sell flesh to eat. {10}</p>
<p>“He should avoid association</p>
<p>With those beings who are keepers of women,</p>
<p>Dancers, wrestlers, musicians,</p>
<p>And other people of that kind. {11}</p>
<p>“He should not frequent courtesans</p>
<p>Or others who provide pleasures;</p>
<p>He should completely avoid</p>
<p>The enjoyments that they provide. {12}</p>
<p>“When the wise one is teaching</p>
<p>The Dharma to a woman,</p>
<p>He should not be alone with her,</p>
<p>Nor should it be an occasion for laughter. {13}</p>
<p>“If he has to enter a village</p>
<p>Repeatedly to obtain alms,</p>
<p>He should find a companion bhikṣu</p>
<p>Or otherwise should recollect the Buddha. {14}</p>
<p>“I have here taught</p>
<p>The first practice and field of activity</p>
<p>That should be maintained by the wise ones</p>
<p>Who uphold this kind of sūtra. {15}</p>
<p>“When they are not engaged in any phenomenon,</p>
<p>Whether inferior, superior, or middling,</p>
<p>Whether composite or noncomposite,</p>
<p>Whether existent or nonexistent, {16}</p>
<p>“When the stable ones do not entertain the notion of ‘woman,’</p>
<p>And do not have the concept of ‘man,’</p>
<p>Then, because all phenomena are unborn,</p>
<p>Upon seeking them they do not see them. {17}</p>
<p>“This practice that I have described</p>
<p>Is completely that of the bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Listen to the explanation</p>
<p>Of that which is their field of activity. {18}</p>
<p>“These phenomena are declared nonexistent;</p>
<p>They are all unproduced and unborn.</p>
<p>They remain empty and motionless at all times:</p>
<p>That is what is called the field of activity of the wise. {19}</p>
<p>“Being and not being, existing and not existing:</p>
<p>These are fabrications of erroneous conceptualization.</p>
<p>Unborn phenomena that are also unoriginated</p>
<p>Are misconstrued to be born and existing. {20}</p>
<p>“With a one-pointed mind, always in meditation,</p>
<p>As completely stable as Mount Sumeru,</p>
<p>Stable in this way, they should view</p>
<p>All these phenomena as being like space. {21}</p>
<p>“They are always the same as space, without an essence,</p>
<p>Motionless and devoid of illusory thoughts.</p>
<p>This is the way phenomena are throughout time.</p>
<p>This is what is called the field of activity of the wise. {22}</p>
<p>“The bhikṣus who after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Maintain my way of mendicancy</p>
<p>Should teach this sūtra in the world</p>
<p>And be free of any apprehension. {23}</p>
<p>“The wise ones should at times contemplate,</p>
<p>Enter their room, close the door,</p>
<p>View the nature of phenomena,</p>
<p>Rise up, and teach without apprehension. {24}</p>
<p>“They will be given protection by the kings</p>
<p>And those princes who listen to the Dharma.</p>
<p>Moreover, householders and brahmins</p>
<p>Will all be present as their followers. {25}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, after I have passed into nirvāṇa, in the later times, in a later era, when the Dharma is being destroyed, bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to teach this Dharma teaching will be established in happiness. Thus established in happiness, they will teach the Dharma. When they teach it to others, whether it is from memory or based on a book, they will not be those who are seeking for faults in others, they will not speak ill of other bhikṣu dharmabhāṇakas, they will not say unpleasant things about them, they will not state unpleasant things about them. They will not say unpleasant things about them while mentioning by name bhikṣus of the Śrāvakayāna. They will not speak unpleasant things about them, nor will they have the concept of being their opponent. Why is that? It is because they will be remaining in a state of happiness. They will teach the Dharma to those who come to listen to them beneficially and without envy. They will not quarrel and will not answer questions with an answer from the Śrāvakayāna, but instead they will answer as one would who has attained the enlightenment of the wisdom of buddhahood.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān recited these verses:</p>
<p>“The wise ones will always remain happy.</p>
<p>Being so, they will teach the Dharma.</p>
<p>In a pure and pleasant place</p>
<p>They will spread out a wide seat. {26}</p>
<p>“They will wear a clean Dharma robe</p>
<p>That has been dyed an excellent color.</p>
<p>They will wrap themselves in a dark monastic cloak</p>
<p>And wear a large, excellent lower robe. {27}</p>
<p>“They will sit upon a seat, with a footstool,</p>
<p>That is covered with various pieces of calico.</p>
<p>They will wash their feet well and then go up onto it,</p>
<p>Having oiled their head and their face. {28}</p>
<p>“Seated upon that Dharma throne,</p>
<p>They will give a variety of teachings</p>
<p>To the single-minded beings who have assembled,</p>
<p>And to the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs. {29}</p>
<p>“Those wise ones who are without envy</p>
<p>Will speak pleasantly on various subjects</p>
<p>To the upāsakas and upāsikās,</p>
<p>And similarly to the kings and princes. {30}</p>
<p>“At that time when they ask them questions</p>
<p>They will again teach with the appropriate meaning.</p>
<p>Whoever hears the meaning that is taught</p>
<p>In this way will attain enlightenment. {31}</p>
<p>“They will free themselves from all laziness</p>
<p>And they will not give rise to thoughts of fatigue.</p>
<p>The wise ones will dispel all unhappiness</p>
<p>And contemplate their followers with love. {32}</p>
<p>“Day and night, they will meditate on the supreme Dharma</p>
<p>And those wise ones, using a quintillion parables,</p>
<p>Will delight the assembly and make them happy,</p>
<p>And they will never have even the slightest desire. {33}</p>
<p>“They will not think of food and drink,</p>
<p>Eating and drinking, clothes, bed and seat,</p>
<p>Dharma robes, or medicine when ill,</p>
<p>And they will not request anything from their followers. {34}</p>
<p>“Moreover, the wise ones will always think,</p>
<p>‘May I and these beings attain buddhahood!</p>
<p>This Dharma that I teach in order to benefit the world</p>
<p>Has all the requisites for bringing happiness.’ {35}</p>
<p>“The bhikṣus who after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Teach this without envy</p>
<p>Will have no suffering, no obstacles,</p>
<p>Will have no misery or be disturbed. {36}</p>
<p>“They will never be afraid,</p>
<p>Will not be beaten or abused;</p>
<p>They will never be chased away</p>
<p>And will be established in the power of patience. {37}</p>
<p>“The wise ones always remain in happiness.</p>
<p>They remain just as I have taught.</p>
<p>They will have many billions of qualities</p>
<p>That could not be described in a hundred eons. {38}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, in the final age when the Dharma will vanish, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possess this sūtra will be without envy, or deceit, or fraud. They will speak no ill of other individuals of the Bodhisattva­yāna. They will not malign them and will not criticize them. They will not inspire regret in the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who follow the Śrāvakayāna, the Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, or the Bodhisattva­yāna.</p>
<p>“They will not inspire regret in those who follow the Bodhisattva­yāna by saying, ‘Noble ones, you are far from the highest, complete enlightenment; it will not appear to you. You should remain utterly inattentive, and do not have the power to attain the Tathāgata’s wisdom in complete buddhahood.’</p>
<p>“They will not delight in disputes concerning the Dharma. They will not engage in Dharma disputes. They will not abandon the power of love for all beings. They will perceive all the tathāgatas as their father. They will perceive all bodhisattvas as teachers. Continuously, with a higher motivation, they will pay reverential homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are in the worlds in the ten directions. When they teach the Dharma, they will teach the Dharma without omission or addition. When teaching this Dharma teaching, they will teach the Dharma with an equal joy in all the Dharma. Even their slightest joy will be joy in the Dharma through which they bring great benefit.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have this third quality, who teach this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, in the final times when the Dharma is coming to an end, will teach this Dharma teaching while remaining in contact with happiness and being free of harm, and will have companions with whom to chant the Dharma.</p>
<p>“There will also appear those who listen to this Dharma teaching, and those who listen to this Dharma teaching will have faith in it, have conviction in it, possess it, comprehend it, write it out, cause it to be written out, and, having made it into a text, honor it, revere it, respect it, and make offerings to it.”</p>
<p>That is what the Bhagavān said, and when the Tathāgata had spoken these words, the Teacher added the following verses:</p>
<p>“The dharmabhāṇakas who wish to teach this sūtra</p>
<p>Should completely eliminate</p>
<p>All deception, arrogance, and similarly calumny,</p>
<p>And also the wise ones should harbor no envy. {39}</p>
<p>“They will never say anything unpleasant to anyone.</p>
<p>They will never engage in disputes over view.</p>
<p>They will never create a cause for doubt, saying,</p>
<p>‘You will not attain the highest wisdom.’ {40}</p>
<p>“They will always be mindful and gentle</p>
<p>And have the patience of a sugata’s child.</p>
<p>They will teach this Dharma again and again</p>
<p>And they will not have the slightest weariness in doing so. {41}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas who are in the ten directions</p>
<p>Are active in the world with compassion for beings.</p>
<p>The wise ones will think, ‘They are all my teachers,’</p>
<p>And they will have toward them the respect one has for a guru. {42}</p>
<p>“They will think of the buddhas, the supreme human beings,</p>
<p>And always conceive of the jinas as their father.</p>
<p>They will eliminate all ideas of pride</p>
<p>And at that time there will arise no obstacles. {43}</p>
<p>“Having heard such Dharma as this,</p>
<p>The wise ones will at that time protect it well.</p>
<p>Because they will remain in happiness and meditation</p>
<p>They will be protected by millions of beings. {44}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, at the time when the Dharma is abandoned, the bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣus who wish to possess this Dharma teaching should dwell farther than far away from householders and renunciants. They should dwell there through dwelling in love. They should have compassion for all those beings who are not yet dedicated to enlightenment. They should think, ‘Oh! Those beings who do not listen to the Tathāgata’s skillful method, to his teaching with an implied meaning, and do not know it, do not understand it, do not ask questions about it, have no faith in it, and have no aspiration for it—those beings have extremely corrupt knowledge . Moreover, those beings are not following and have not understood this Dharma teaching. I shall attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, and then, wherever they are, through my miraculous power I will cause them to be attracted to it, have conviction in it, follow it, and I will completely ripen them.’</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have this fourth quality and teach this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa will not be harmed. Bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, kings, princes, the king’s prime ministers, the king’s counselors, the people of the city, the people of the country, the brahmins, and the householders will honor them, respect them, revere them, and make offerings to them. The devas who live in the air and have faith will follow them in order to hear the Dharma. The devas will constantly follow them in order to protect them. Whether they are in a village or in a temple there will come to them day and night those who wish to ask them about the Dharma and they will delight and please them with their answers.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Mañjuśrī, it is because this Dharma teaching has been blessed by all the buddhas. Mañjuśrī, it is because this Dharma teaching is constantly blessed by the past, future, and present tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, it is difficult in many worlds to be able to hear the words, the sound, or the name of this Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, it is like this: A bala­cakra­vartin king obtains his kingdom through his might. The allied kings who are his adversaries go to battle with him. The bala­cakra­vartin king has numerous warriors. They go into battle with his enemies. When the king sees his warriors battling, he is delighted, pleased, and overjoyed because of those warriors. Being delighted, pleased, and overjoyed, he gives various gifts to those warriors. He gives them villages and the land of the villages, towns and the land of the towns, clothing, turbans, bracelets, anklets, short necklaces, cords of gold, earrings, medium-length necklaces, long necklaces, cowries, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, and corals. He gives them elephants, cavalry, chariots, infantry, male slaves, and female slaves. He gives them carriages and palanquins. However, he does not give his crest jewel to anyone. Why is that? It is because there is only the one jewel that is affixed on his topknot. Mañjuśrī, if the king were to give away his crest jewel, all four divisions of the king’s army would be astonished and amazed.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, it is likewise that the Tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha creates through the might of his arms and his merit the three realms of a Dharma king within the three realms, which is trampled on by evil Māra. Then the ārya warriors of the Tathāgata battle with Māra.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, the King of the Dharma, the Lord of the Dharma, teaches hundreds of thousands of sūtras to those battling ārya warriors. In order to make happy the fourfold assembly he gives them the gift of the town of nirvāṇa and the great city of the Dharma, teaching them through nirvāṇa, but not teaching them this kind of Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, the bala­cakra­vartin king is amazed by the great strength of the men when the warriors are fighting, and subsequently he does give them his crest jewel, the supreme of all his possessions, which the world does not believe in, and which is amazing.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, just as that king keeps the crest jewel fixed upon his topknot for a long time, in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, who is the great King of the Dharma, while he is the King of the Dharma sees the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas battling with the Māra of the skandhas or the Māra of the kleśas. When they battle with them, desire, anger, and ignorance cease, they escape from all three realms, and have the great strength of a great being who defeats all the māras. This pleases the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly awakened Buddha, who then teaches those ārya warriors this kind of Dharma teaching, which is contrary to the world, which is not believed in by the world, which has previously not been expounded, which has previously not been taught. The Tathāgata gives to the śrāvakas that which causes all to attain omniscience, which is like the great crest jewel.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, this is the supreme Dharma taught by the tathāgatas. This is the final Dharma teaching of the tathāgatas. Among all Dharma teachings this is the most profound Dharma teaching. It does not accord with the world.</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, just as the bala­cakra­vartin king unties the crest jewel he had kept for a long time and gives it to the supreme warriors, likewise today the Tathāgata teaches the secret Dharma teaching of the Tathāgata that has been kept for a long time, which is at the crest of all Dharma teachings, and which is known by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān taught this topic in detail in verse:</p>
<p>“Demonstrating the power of kindness,</p>
<p>Always having compassion for beings,</p>
<p>They should teach this kind of Dharma:</p>
<p>The supreme sūtra praised by the sugatas. {45}</p>
<p>“To those who are householders or renunciants,</p>
<p>And those who are not bodhisattvas in the later age,</p>
<p>He should manifest the power of kindness to them all,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘Having heard the Dharma they may denounce it. {46}</p>
<p>“ ‘I will gain the attainment of enlightenment</p>
<p>And when I am established in buddhahood,</p>
<p>Established in method, I will guide them</p>
<p>And make known this supreme enlightenment.’ {47}</p>
<p>“A bala­cakra­vartin king, when pleased,</p>
<p>Gives to his warriors many cowries,</p>
<p>And gives them towns and villages,</p>
<p>And elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry. {48}</p>
<p>“Delighted, to some he gives bracelets</p>
<p>And cords of silver and of gold.</p>
<p>He gives to them all kinds of gifts</p>
<p>Such as pearls, jewels, corals, and crystals. {49}</p>
<p>“At a time when there is someone present</p>
<p>Who is astonishing because of his supreme heroism,</p>
<p>Knowing that he has accomplished such wonders,</p>
<p>He removes his topknot jewel and gives it to him. {50}</p>
<p>“In the same way, I, the Buddha, the Dharma King</p>
<p>Have the strength of patience and many treasures of wisdom,</p>
<p>And I teach the Dharma to the entire world</p>
<p>Through caring to benefit and having compassion. {51}</p>
<p>“Seeing those who are in distress,</p>
<p>I teach thousands of millions of sūtras;</p>
<p>Knowing the heroism of those individuals,</p>
<p>Pure beings who have defeated the kleśas, {52}</p>
<p>“The King of Dharma, the great physician,</p>
<p>Gives thousands of millions of teachings.</p>
<p>Knowing beings to have the strength and wisdom,</p>
<p>He teaches this sūtra that is like a crest jewel. {53}</p>
<p>“This is the highest of all my sūtras.</p>
<p>It is the last sūtra that I teach in the world.</p>
<p>I have never taught it, but kept it secret.</p>
<p>Today I will expound it, so listen everyone! {54}</p>
<p>“When I have passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>Those who rely upon such four qualities as these,</p>
<p>Who aim for the highest, supreme enlightenment</p>
<p>And carry out for me the work that has to be done, {55}</p>
<p>“Will have no misery and no obstacles,</p>
<p>And will not have an ugly color or illness;</p>
<p>They will not be black in color,</p>
<p>And they will not live in an inferior town. {56}</p>
<p>“Those great rishis will always be pleasant to see</p>
<p>And offerings wil be made to them as if they were tathāgatas.</p>
<p>Even the young devas</p>
<p>Will always be serving as their attendants. {57}</p>
<p>“They will never be harmed by poison or weapons.</p>
<p>Their bodies will not be struck by clods, stones, or sticks.</p>
<p>Whoever speaks ill of them</p>
<p>Will become silent, their mouths closed. {58}</p>
<p>“Whoever possesses this sūtra after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Will become a friend for beings.</p>
<p>They will shine with light and travel the earth,</p>
<p>Dispelling darkness for many millions of beings. {59}</p>
<p>“They will see good things in their dreams:</p>
<p>They will see bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs</p>
<p>And likewise myself upon a lion throne</p>
<p>Teaching many kinds of Dharma. {60}</p>
<p>“They will also in their dreams teach many kinds</p>
<p>Of Dharma to devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and asuras</p>
<p>As numerous as the Ganges sands,</p>
<p>All with hands placed together in homage. {61}</p>
<p>“In their dreams they will see the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>The Lord with a beautiful voice and the color of gold,</p>
<p>Teaching the Dharma to many millions of beings,</p>
<p>Radiating thousands of light rays. {62}</p>
<p>“There they will place their hands together in homage</p>
<p>And they will praise the Muni, the supreme human.</p>
<p>And the Jina, the great physician, will teach</p>
<p>The supreme Dharma to the fourfold assembly. {63}</p>
<p>“Hearing that, they will be overjoyed,</p>
<p>And delighted, they will make offerings.</p>
<p>They will quickly reach irreversible wisdom</p>
<p>And attain the power of retention in their dreams. {64}</p>
<p>“The Lord of the World will know their thoughts</p>
<p>And give them the prophecy of becoming a supreme being,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Noble one, here, in a future time</p>
<p>You will reach the highest peace and wisdom. {65}</p>
<p>“ ‘Your realm will be extremely vast.</p>
<p>Your fourfold assembly will be like mine.</p>
<p>Its members will be reverential with hands together in homage,</p>
<p>And they will listen to the immaculate Dharma.’ {66}</p>
<p>“They will also see my body while</p>
<p>Meditating on the Dharma in the mountains.</p>
<p>By meditating on the Dharma they will reach the true nature.</p>
<p>They will attain samādhi and will see the Jina. {67}</p>
<p>“In their dreams they will see the body</p>
<p>With the color of gold, possessing the signs of hundreds of merits,</p>
<p>Will listen to the Dharma, and, having heard it, teach an assembly.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of dreams that they will dream. {68}</p>
<p>“In their dreams they will forsake a kingdom,</p>
<p>And their harem, and likewise crowds of kinsmen;</p>
<p>Forsaking all desires they will enter homelessness</p>
<p>And they will go to where the Bodhimaṇḍa is. {69}</p>
<p>“Wishing to attain enlightenment, they will sit</p>
<p>On a lion throne at the foot of a tree.</p>
<p>And when seven days have passed in that way</p>
<p>They will attain the wisdom of the tathāgatas. {70}</p>
<p>“Having attained enlightenment they will stand up</p>
<p>And they will turn the immaculate wheel</p>
<p>And teach the Dharma to the fourfold assembly</p>
<p>For countless billions of eons. {71}</p>
<p>“Through teaching there the immaculate Dharma,</p>
<p>Many millions of beings will attain nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The nirvāṇa that is the end of causes, like an extinguished lamp.</p>
<p>They will dream those kinds of dreams. {72}</p>
<p>“Whoever in the future times teaches</p>
<p>The supreme sūtra that I have taught well</p>
<p>Will have many, endless benefits.</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa, it will always be like that for them.” {73}</p>
<p>This concludes “Dwelling in Happiness,” the thirteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Bodhisattvas Emerging Out of the Ground</p>
<p>Chapter 14</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattvas who had arrived from other world realms, who were as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers, stood up in the circle of the assembly, bowed to the Bhagavān with hands together in homage, and said these words:</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, if the Bhagavān will permit us, after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we too will teach this Dharma teaching in the Sahā world realm. We will read it, write it, and make offerings to it. We shall be dedicated to this Dharma teaching. Bhagavān, teach well this Dharma teaching to us.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān then asked all those bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, why would you need to do this? In this Sahā world realm there are my thousands of bodhisattvas who are as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers. Each one of those bodhisattvas has, as followers, thousands of bodhisattvas who are themselves as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, and each of those bodhisattvas has that many followers, too. In the future times, after I have passed into nirvāṇa, they will possess this Dharma teaching and they will teach it.”</p>
<p>As soon as the Bhagavān had uttered those words, this entire Sahā world realm cracked apart completely, was rent with fissures, and there came out from within those fissures the bodhisattvas who lived in the Sahā world realm, the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas, with their golden bodies and their thirty-two signs of a great being, who dwelled in the element of space beneath the great earth. They had heard the Bhagavān’s words, and came out from under the ground. Each one of these bodhisattvas had a following of bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, in groups, great groups, along with the teachers of those groups.</p>
<p>Thus it was that there appeared from out of the ground of this Sahā world realm bodhisattva mahāsattvas in groups, great groups, along with the teachers of those groups—hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in forty Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in thirty Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in twenty Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in five Ganges Rivers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in one Ganges River, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in half a Ganges River, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with bodhisattva followers as numerous as the grains of sand in a quarter of a Ganges River, or in a sixth, or in an eighth, or in a twentieth, or in a fiftieth, or in a hundredth, or in a thousandth, or in a ten millionth, or in a billionth, or in a trillionth, or in a quintillionth, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with many quintillions of bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with ten million bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with a hundred thousand bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with a thousand bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with five hundred bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with four hundred or three hundred or two hundred bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with a hundred bodhisattva followers, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with fifty bodhisattva followers, and likewise, let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with forty bodhisattva followers, or thirty, or twenty, or ten, or five, or four, or three, or two, and let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with one bodhisattva follower.</p>
<p>Those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were beyond number, calculation, simile, or comparison emerged from the ground of the Sahā world realm. When they had emerged they went toward the precious stūpa suspended in the air within which the bhagavān tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa, and the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni were sitting together upon a lion throne. When they arrived there, they bowed their heads to the feet of both tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.</p>
<p>They bowed down and paid homage to the emanations of the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni, the bodies of the tathāgatas who had gathered from the other world realms in the ten directions, the bhagavāns who were seated on lion thrones at the foot of trees made of various precious materials.</p>
<p>They circumambulated those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas hundreds of thousands of times and they praised them with many kinds of bodhisattva praises, and then they stood to one side with their hands together in homage and they paid homage to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna.</p>
<p>At that time those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had emerged from the ground paid homage to the tathāgatas and praised them with various bodhisattva praises for fifty intermediate eons. During those fifty intermediate eons Bhagavān Śākyamuni remained silent, and the fourfold assembly also remained silent for those fifty intermediate eons.</p>
<p>The Bhagavān now brought about a miracle, such that through that miracle the fourfold assembly thought those eons were just one afternoon. They saw this Sahā world realm became the size of a hundred thousand world realms and filled with bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>There were four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal ones among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas. They were the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra, the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Anantacāritra, the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Vi­śuddha­cāritra, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Su­pratiṣṭhita­cāritra. Those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas now stood before that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas, and in front of the Bhagavān, with hands placed together in homage, they inquired of the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, do you have few troubles, do you have little illness, are you happy? Bhagavān, are the beings in your care of good character? Do they have good understanding? Are they easy to guide? Are they easy to purify? Are they not a cause of sadness for the Bhagavān?”</p>
<p>Those four bodhisattvas then spoke these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“Lord of the World, who shines with light,</p>
<p>Are you dwelling in happiness?</p>
<p>Are you free from illness?</p>
<p>Is your sinless body well? {1}</p>
<p>“Are the beings in your care of good character?</p>
<p>Are they easy to guide and easy to purify?</p>
<p>Do they not cause you sadness</p>
<p>When the Lord of the World teaches?” {2}</p>
<p>In reply, the Bhagavān answered those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, it is like this: I dwell in happiness; I have little harm, little illness. The beings in my care are of good character, have good understanding, are easily guided, and are easily purified. They do not cause me sadness while they are being purified. Why is that? Noble ones, it is because these beings of mine have trained during the time of previous perfectly enlightened buddhas. Noble ones, they become devoted just on seeing me and hearing me, and they enter and remain in the wisdom of the buddhas, except for those who are engaged in the practice of the level of the śrāvakas. But I have also now brought them into the wisdom of the buddhas, and caused them to hear the ultimate truth.”</p>
<p>At this those bodhisattva mahāsattvas responded with these verses:</p>
<p>“Excellent! Excellent, great hero!</p>
<p>We are overjoyed</p>
<p>That the beings under your care have good character,</p>
<p>Are easy to guide, easy to purify, {3}</p>
<p>“And, Guide, that those who listen</p>
<p>To this your profound wisdom,</p>
<p>Give rise to devotion on hearing it</p>
<p>And become those who are guided.” {4}</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to those four bodhisattva mahāsattvas who were the principal figures among that great gathering of bodhisattvas, that great aggregation of bodhisattvas, “Excellent, noble ones, excellent! Noble ones, your praise of the Tathāgata is excellent, excellent!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and hundreds of thousands of quintillions of other bodhisattvas, as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers, thought, “A great gathering of bodhisattvas, a great aggregation of bodhisattvas has emerged from the ground, and standing before the Bhagavān has honored, revered, and pleased the Bhagavān. This is something we have never seen and never heard of before. Where did these bodhisattva mahāsattvas come from?”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was aware of his own doubt and uncertainty and knew in his own mind the thoughts that were in the minds of hundreds of thousands of quintillions of other bodhisattvas, as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers. He placed his hands together in homage, and to the Bhagavān he expressed these thoughts in verses:</p>
<p>“Supreme human, tell us</p>
<p>About these many hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>Of quintillions of infinite bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who have never appeared before. {5}</p>
<p>“They who have great miraculous powers,</p>
<p>From where did they come, and how?</p>
<p>They who have massive bodies,</p>
<p>Where did they come from? {6}</p>
<p>“All of these steadfast ones,</p>
<p>Great rishis who have mindfulness</p>
<p>And have extremely beautiful bodies,</p>
<p>Where did they come from? {7}</p>
<p>“Lord of the World, there have arrived</p>
<p>These wise bodhisattvas, each of whom</p>
<p>Has an incalculable following</p>
<p>As numerous as the sands of the Ganges. {8}</p>
<p>“The followers of the bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>Who are renowned and are as numerous</p>
<p>As the sands of sixty complete Ganges Rivers,</p>
<p>Have all become fixed upon enlightenment. {9}</p>
<p>“The number of such heroes as these,</p>
<p>These protectors and their followers,</p>
<p>Is the number of sand grains</p>
<p>In sixty Ganges Rivers. {10}</p>
<p>“And there are even more than that:</p>
<p>Others with endless followers</p>
<p>As numerous as the grains of sand</p>
<p>in fifty, in forty, in thirty, {11}</p>
<p>“And in twenty Ganges Rivers.</p>
<p>There are such numbers of assemblies of followers,</p>
<p>And there are even more than that,</p>
<p>As numerous as sands in ten and five Ganges Rivers. {12}</p>
<p>“The assemblies of each of those protectors</p>
<p>Those sons of the buddhas—</p>
<p>Guide, assemblies such as these,</p>
<p>Where have they come from? {13}</p>
<p>“In the assemblies of the bodhisattvas</p>
<p>There are accompanying students</p>
<p>Who are as numerous as the sands</p>
<p>In four, three, or two Ganges, {14}</p>
<p>“And there are others far more numerous.</p>
<p>There is no end to their numbers.</p>
<p>It would not be possible to count them</p>
<p>Even in ten thousand million eons. {15}</p>
<p>“There are also retinues</p>
<p>Of the bodhisattvas, heroes, protectors,</p>
<p>That equal a half, a third, a tenth,</p>
<p>Or a twentieth of the Ganges sands. {16}</p>
<p>“And there are others far more numerous,</p>
<p>And if one were to count them one by one</p>
<p>One would not be able to calculate the number of them</p>
<p>Even in a thousand million eons. {17}</p>
<p>“And there are others far more numerous,</p>
<p>With assemblies that are numerous:</p>
<p>A hundred trillion, and ten million,</p>
<p>And also those that are five million. {18}</p>
<p>“There are also great rishis</p>
<p>Who are bodhisattvas with great wisdom.</p>
<p>They are beyond number,</p>
<p>And all are present showing reverence. {19}</p>
<p>“Their followers number a thousand,</p>
<p>Or similarly a hundred, or fifty—</p>
<p>One could not count them all</p>
<p>Even in a thousand million eons. {20}</p>
<p>“The followers of those heroes</p>
<p>Also number twenty, or ten, or five,</p>
<p>Or similarly four, or three, or two—</p>
<p>One cannot count them all. {21}</p>
<p>“There are those who travel alone,</p>
<p>Who find peace on their own.</p>
<p>They who have come here on this day,</p>
<p>They also are beyond enumeration. {22}</p>
<p>“If someone were to count them for eons</p>
<p>As numerous as the Ganges sands</p>
<p>Using a stick held in their hand,</p>
<p>They would still not come to an end. {23}</p>
<p>“All of these great beings,</p>
<p>Protectors with dedication,</p>
<p>These bodhisattva heroes,</p>
<p>Where did they come from? {24}</p>
<p>“Who has taught them the Dharma?</p>
<p>Who has brought them to enlightenment?</p>
<p>Whose teaching do they delight in?</p>
<p>Whose teachings do they hold? {25}</p>
<p>“This entire ground having broken open,</p>
<p>Throughout all the four directions</p>
<p>There have emerged those with great wisdom</p>
<p>Who are sagacious, and have miraculous powers. {26}</p>
<p>“Muni, this world realm</p>
<p>Has been completely broken apart</p>
<p>And in that way have emerged</p>
<p>These fearless bodhisattvas. {27}</p>
<p>“What has occurred here</p>
<p>We have never seen before.</p>
<p>Guide of the World, tell us</p>
<p>The name of that realm. {28}</p>
<p>“We have been again and again</p>
<p>Throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>But we have never seen</p>
<p>Such bodhisattvas as these. {29}</p>
<p>“We have never before seen</p>
<p>A single one of these offspring of yours.</p>
<p>But today we have suddenly seen them.</p>
<p>Muni, tell us of their activities. {30}</p>
<p>“Tens of thousands</p>
<p>Of trillions of bodhisattvas,</p>
<p>All filled with astonishment,</p>
<p>Are looking at the supreme human. {31}</p>
<p>“Immeasurable one, devoid of the skandhas,</p>
<p>Great hero, we ask you to reveal to us,</p>
<p>Courageous one, from where have come</p>
<p>These bodhisattvas who have no fear?” {32}</p>
<p>At that time, the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni’s emanations as other tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who had arrived from a hundred thousand quintillion world realms were teaching beings in other worlds. They were sitting cross-legged on lion thrones made of precious materials at the foot of trees made of precious materials in all eight directions from the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni. The followers of those tathāgatas also saw a great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, a great aggregation of bodhisattvas emerge from the ground, and remain suspended in the sky. They were astonished and amazed. They asked their own tathāgatas, “Bhagavān, from where did these countless, innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas come?”</p>
<p>Each of those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas said to their own followers, “Noble ones, wait a little while, because the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, whose highest, complete enlightenment has been prophesied by Bhagavān Śākyamuni, has asked Bhagavān Śākyamuni that same question. Buddha Śākyamuni is going to answer, so you should listen to him.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān then said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, this question you have asked me concerning this vast subject is excellent, Ajita, excellent!”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān now turned to the entire assembly of bodhisattvas and announced to them, “Noble ones, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha is going to teach the Tathāgata’s wisdom insight, the Tathāgata’s leadership, the Tathāgata’s activity, the Tathāgata’s displays, the Tathāgata’s expanding power, and the Tathāgata’s heroism. Therefore, noble ones, this entire assembly of bodhisattvas should be attentive, focused, and stable.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān pronounced these verses:</p>
<p>“All you noble ones, be attentive:</p>
<p>I am going to speak infallible words.</p>
<p>Wise ones, do not become disheartened.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the tathāgatas is inconceivable. {33}</p>
<p>“You should all be stable and mindful.</p>
<p>You should all remain in a state of concentration.</p>
<p>Listen to a Dharma that has not appeared before</p>
<p>And which is a marvel of the tathāgatas. {34}</p>
<p>“I shall establish you well in this.</p>
<p>None of you should have any doubt.</p>
<p>I, the Guide, speak infallibly.</p>
<p>My wisdom remains forever incalculable. {35}</p>
<p>“The Sugata has realized profound dharmas,</p>
<p>Which are unexaminable and unquantifiable.</p>
<p>I am going to teach those dharmas;</p>
<p>Listen to me as to what they are and how they are.” {36}</p>
<p>Having pronounced those verses, Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, I declare to you, I proclaim to you, Ajita, as for these innumerable, numberless, inconceivable, unequaled, uncountable bodhisattvas whom you have never seen before, who emerged from the ground, after I had attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in this Sahā world realm, Ajita, I inspired and developed all these bodhisattva mahāsattvas toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Noble ones, I ripened them for this bodhisattva Dharma, established them in it, and caused them to follow it, remain in it, and understand it.</p>
<p>“Ajita, these bodhisattva mahāsattvas live in this Sahā world realm by occupying the realm of space below, where they are engaged in reciting and receiving the teachings, and correctly contemplating them.</p>
<p>“These noble ones do not delight in the activities of society, they delight in the absence of society. Their diligence does not weaken, they apply themselves with diligence. Ajita, these noble ones delight in solitude and find pleasure in solitude. These noble ones do not live by relying upon either devas or humans. These noble ones delight in activities that are devoid of worldly gatherings, delight in the pleasure of the Dharma, and are dedicated to the wisdom of buddhahood.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“These bodhisattvas are innumerable.</p>
<p>They are countless and beyond measure.</p>
<p>They possess miracles, wisdom, and learning,</p>
<p>And for many millions of eons have practiced with knowledge. {37}</p>
<p>“I have ripened them all for enlightenment</p>
<p>And they dwell within my own realm.</p>
<p>All of these I have ripened—</p>
<p>These bodhisattvas are my offspring. {38}</p>
<p>“They all are dedicated to solitude</p>
<p>And reject the level of worldly gatherings.</p>
<p>They follow the example of my supreme conduct;</p>
<p>These children of mine practice free from worldly gatherings. {39}</p>
<p>“They dwell in space as their habitation.</p>
<p>These heroes live below this realm.</p>
<p>They perfect this supreme enlightenment,</p>
<p>Attentively dedicated day and night. {40}</p>
<p>“They are all mindful and practice diligently,</p>
<p>And established in the immeasurable strength of wisdom.</p>
<p>All of these luminous offspring of mine</p>
<p>Are teaching the Dharma fearlessly. {41}</p>
<p>“After I attained this highest enlightenment</p>
<p>At the foot of a tree by the city of Gayā,</p>
<p>I turned the unsurpassable wheel of the Dharma</p>
<p>And I ripened all to this supreme enlightenment. {42}</p>
<p>“You should all have faith when you hear</p>
<p>These immaculate words of mine.</p>
<p>I have, in that way, ripened all of these</p>
<p>Since I attained supreme enlightenment.” {43}</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the many hundred thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas were then astonished and amazed. How could the Buddha in a moment—in such a short time—inspire and ripen for the highest, complete enlightenment all these countless bodhisattvas?</p>
<p>So the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya inquired of the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, when the Tathāgata was a young man, you left the Śākya town of Kapilavastu for homelessness. You went to the supreme Bodhimaṇḍa that is not very far from the city of Gayā. You attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. Bhagavān, since that time until today more than forty years have passed. Bhagavān, how could the Tathāgata in such a short time as this accomplish such countless tathāgata activities as these? How did you attain the preeminence of a tathāgata, and the heroism of a tathāgata? Bhagavān, you have inspired and ripened for the highest, complete enlightenment this great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, this great aggregation of bodhisattvas, in just that amount of time. Bhagavān, one would not be able to count this great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, this great aggregation of bodhisattvas, even in a hundred thousand quintillion eons. Bhagavān, such innumerable, countless bodhisattvas have practiced celibacy for a long time, creating roots of merit under many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, and perfecting themselves over many hundreds of thousands of eons.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, it is as if there were a young man, a lad of twenty-five years of age, with black hair, in the first phase of his adulthood, who revealed that he has sons that are a hundred years old. He says, ‘These noble ones are my sons; they are my sons,’ and they say, ‘This man is our father.’ Bhagavān, what they say would not be believed. It would be difficult for the world to believe them.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, similarly, it is not very long since you, Tathāgata, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood. These countless, innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas have practiced celibacy for many hundreds of thousands of eons; they have gained certainty in the wisdom of buddhahood during a long period of time; they are skilled in resting in hundreds of thousands of samādhis; they have developed the great higher knowledges; they are wise in the level of buddhahood; they are skilled in teaching the dharmas of the Tathāgata; they are an amazement and wonder in this world; and they have attained great diligence, strength, and might.</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān has said of them, ‘I am the one who first established them on the level of being a bodhisattva; I am the one who has ripened and developed them. It is through my attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood that I have accomplished all this diligence and heroism.’</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we will have faith in whatever the Tathāgata says, thinking, ‘The Tathāgata speaks infallibly. The Tathāgata knows the truth.’ However, Bhagavān, those newly following in the Bodhisattva­yāna will have doubts. After the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, they will hear this Dharma teaching and they will not believe it, will not have faith in it, and will not be attracted to it. Therefore, Bhagavān, they will accrue the karma of rejecting the Dharma.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, explain the meaning of this well, so that we will not have any kind of doubt in this Dharma, and so that in the future time, when noble men and noble women who are on the Bodhisattva­yāna hear it, they will not doubt it.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then addressed these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“You were born in Kapilāhvaya,</p>
<p>But then you renounced the residence of the Śākyas,</p>
<p>And attained enlightenment by the city of Gayā.</p>
<p>Lord of the World, it has not been long since then. {44}</p>
<p>“These fearless ones and many others in this great crowd</p>
<p>Have practiced for millions of eons.</p>
<p>They are unwaveringly established in miraculous powers.</p>
<p>Excellently learned, they have realized the power of wisdom. {45}</p>
<p>“Like lotuses on water that are unstained,</p>
<p>Today they have arrived when the earth split apart.</p>
<p>They all stand respectfully with hands together in homage,</p>
<p>These mindful offspring of the Lord of the World. {46}</p>
<p>“How can the bodhisattvas believe</p>
<p>In such a marvel of yours as this?</p>
<p>Tell us so that doubts will be overcome.</p>
<p>Teach the meaning of this exactly as it is. {47}</p>
<p>“It is as if there were a person,</p>
<p>A youth, a young lad with black hair</p>
<p>Who was born just over twenty years before,</p>
<p>Who introduces hundred-year-old men as his sons. {48}</p>
<p>“They are wrinkled, with white hair, and they say,</p>
<p>‘This is the one who has fathered us.’</p>
<p>Lord of the World, it would be difficult to believe</p>
<p>That such men as those could be the youth’s sons. {49}</p>
<p>“In the same way, the Bhagavān is like that young man,</p>
<p>While these numerous bodhisattvas who have knowledge,</p>
<p>And are mindful, fearless, and endowed with wisdom,</p>
<p>Have trained excellently for billions of eons. {50}</p>
<p>“They have stability, skill in wisdom,</p>
<p>Are all good looking and beautiful,</p>
<p>Have certainty in the Dharma, are fearless,</p>
<p>And are praised by the guides of the worlds. {51}</p>
<p>“They travel around unimpeded like the wind.</p>
<p>They dwell constantly in the realm of space.</p>
<p>These progeny of the Sugata are diligent</p>
<p>In seeking this enlightenment of buddhahood. {52}</p>
<p>“We do not give rise to any doubts whatsoever,</p>
<p>We who hear these words directly from the Lord of the World,</p>
<p>But after the Guide of the World has entered nirvāṇa</p>
<p>How will beings be able to believe in this? {53}</p>
<p>“Bodhisattvas will go to the lower realms</p>
<p>Through having doubts about this matter.</p>
<p>Bhagavān, elucidate for us</p>
<p>In what way you ripened these bodhisattvas.” {54}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Bodhisattvas Emerging Out of the Ground,” the fourteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Lifespan of the Tathāgata</p>
<p>Chapter 15</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the complete assembly of bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said a second time, and a third time, to those bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak. Noble ones, have faith and certainty in the true words that I, the Tathāgata, will speak.”</p>
<p>At this, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas, with bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya standing in front to them, with hands together in homage, requested, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.” A second time, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.” A third time, the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, explain the meaning to us. Sugata, explain it to us. We will believe what the Tathāgata says.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān, knowing that the bodhisattvas had made their request three times, said to those bodhisattvas, “And so, noble ones, listen to what has arisen because of the power of my samādhi.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, the world with its devas, humans, and asuras thinks and believes, ‘Bhagavān Śākyamuni departed from his Śākya clan into mendicancy, went to the preeminent, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood by the city of Gayā.’ However, noble ones, I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago.</p>
<p>“Noble sons, it is like this: If there were a man who picked up one atom from among the atoms of the element of earth in countless fifty hundred thousand quintillion world realms, and he were to carry it in an eastern direction until he had passed countless, fifty hundred thousand quintillion world realms, and were then to deposit that atom there; and if he were to continue on further in that way until the entire element of earth in all those world realms was gone, depositing the atoms in that manner, in that way, into world realms in an eastern direction, then, noble ones, do you think that anyone could conceive of, or calculate, count, or determine the number of those world realms?”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the complete assembly of bodhisattvas said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, those world realms are numberless, are innumerable, and are beyond the capacity of the mind. Bhagavān, even all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas with their higher wisdom could not conceive of, calculate, or determine their number. Bhagavān, even for us bodhisattvas on the level of irreversibility this subject is beyond the scope of our thoughts. Bhagavān, the number of those world realms would be incalculable.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to those bodhisattva mahāsattvas, “Noble ones, I declare to you, I proclaim to you, noble ones, in those world realms in which that man would deposit atoms, and, noble sons, those in which he did not deposit them, there are not, in all those hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms, noble sons, as many atoms as there are hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons since I attained the highest complete enlightenment of buddhahood. Since I began teaching the Dharma to beings in this Sahā world realm and in another hundred thousand quintillion world realms, noble ones, those other tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas whom I have previously mentioned, beginning with Tathāgata Dīpaṃkara, and the passing into nirvāṇa of those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, were my emanations, noble ones, in order to accomplish the teaching of the Dharma through skillful methods. Moreover, noble ones, the Tathāgata, on seeing the extent of the faculties and diligence of the successive beings of future times, states what will be his name in those times, and states when his passing into nirvāṇa will occur, and in that way he will satisfy beings with various kinds of Dharma teachings.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, the Tathāgata says to beings with various aspirations, few roots of merit, and many kleśas, ‘Bhikṣus, I am young; I renounced my family and it has not been long, bhikṣus, since I have attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’</p>
<p>“Noble ones, even though it has thus been a long time since the Tathāgata attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood, he says, ‘It has not been long since I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’ That kind of Dharma was taught solely for the purpose of ripening beings and bringing them into the teaching.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, all those Dharma teachings were taught by the Tathāgata in order to guide beings.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, the words the Tathāgata speaks in order to guide beings, whether spoken by myself or spoken by someone else, whether concerning myself or concerning anyone else—whatever Dharma teachings the Tathāgata has taught, all are the truth that is spoken by the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata does not lie.</p>
<p>“Why is that? The Tathāgata has seen the three realms exactly as they are: there is no birth, no death, no transmigration, no becoming, no saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa, no being, no nonbeing, no existence, no nonexistence, no ‘like this,’ no ‘not like this,’ no ‘untrue,’ and no ‘not untrue.’ The Tathāgata does not see the three realms in the way that ordinary, foolish beings see them. Concerning this, the Tathāgata has the direct perception of phenomena, and there is no phenomenon of which he is oblivious. Therefore, whatever the Tathāgata says is all the truth, without any lies. However, as beings have different kinds of conduct, different kinds of aspirations, and different kinds of perception and conception, in order that they may develop roots of merit, the Tathāgata teaches many kinds of Dharma teachings, with many kinds of goals.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, whatever the Tathāgata has to do, that is what the Tathāgata does. The Tathāgata, who has attained perfect buddhahood a long time ago, has an immeasurable lifespan. He always remains and does not pass into nirvāṇa, but creates the appearance of passing into nirvāṇa in order to benefit his students.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, I still have an entire lifespan of twice times a hundred thousand quintillion eons. Although I will not pass into nirvāṇa, I state that I am going to pass into nirvāṇa. Why is that? Noble ones, it is in order to ripen beings through this Dharma teaching. If I were not to pass into nirvāṇa and were to remain for a long time, because I would be constantly seen, beings would not create roots of merit. They would become destitute, devoid of merit, indulging in desires, blind, and caught in the net of wrong views. Thinking, ‘The Tathāgata remains,’ they would perceive him as easy to meet and would not perceive him as difficult to meet. They would think, ‘The Tathāgata is with us,’ and would not be diligently dedicated to escaping from the three realms. They would not view a tathāgata as being rare.</p>
<p>“Therefore, noble ones, the Tathāgata, using skillful method, states, ‘Bhikṣus, it is very difficult to find the appearance of the tathāgatas.’ Why is that? For those beings, it is possible that they may see a tathāgata after many hundred thousands of quintillions of eons, and it is possible that they will not.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, considering this, I say, ‘Bhikṣus, the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find,’ so that conceiving that the appearance of a tathāgata is difficult to find they perceive it as a wonder, and they have the understanding that a tathāgata passes into nirvāṇa. When they do not see the Tathāgata, they will thirst for the sight of him. The roots of merit from the mind being focused upon the Tathāgata will bring good results, benefits, and happiness for a long time. Knowing this, for the sake of those to be guided, the Tathāgata announces that he will pass into nirvāṇa even though he does not pass into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, that which the Tathāgata states is a Dharma teaching; he does not speak lies.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, it is as if there were a man who is a physician who is wise, eminent, learned, intelligent, very skilled, and could cure all illnesses, and that man has many sons—ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, or a thousand. That physician goes away to somewhere else, and all his sons take a poisonous drink, or a venomous drink. As a result of that poison or venom, they are tormented and tortured by the sensations of suffering and roll around on the ground. Then their father, the physician, returns from his journey. His sons are in distress from the suffering caused by that poison or venom. Some have deluded perceptions and some do not have deluded perception but all are in distress from suffering. They are happy to see their father and say to him, ‘Father, you have returned happily and safely. Free us from this poison or venom that is destroying our bodies. Save our lives!’</p>
<p>“Their father sees that they are distressed by suffering, that they are tormented and tortured by illness and are rolling around on the ground. He gathers together great herbs with excellent color, aroma, and taste and grinds them on a stone. He tells his sons to drink this mixture, saying, ‘Sons, drink this great medicine that is colorful, aromatic, and tasty Noble ones, if you drink this excellent medicine you will quickly be freed from the poison or venom, and will be happy and healthy.’</p>
<p>“Then the physician’s sons who do not have deluded perception see the color of the medicine, smell its aroma, taste its flavor, and quickly drink it. They become completely free from all illness. His sons who have deluded perception praise their father, saying, ‘Father, you have returned happily and safely. Heal us!’ but they do not drink the medicine. Why is that? Because their perception is deluded, they did not like the color of the medicine, did not like its smell, and did not like its taste. Then the physician thinks, ‘These sons of mine have deluded perception because of the poison or venom and so will not drink the medicine, but they are praising me. I will use a skillful method to make them drink this medicine.’</p>
<p>“Then the physician, wishing to use a skillful method to make his sons drink the medicine, says to them, ‘Noble ones, I am old, advanced in years, and aged. The time of my death is close. Sons, do not be sad. Do not be unhappy. If you need great medicine, take this medicine.’ Having instructed them in this way as a skillful method he goes to another land, and having gone there, sends news to his sick sons that he is dying. Then they become very sad, wail and weep, thinking, ‘Our only father, protector, progenitor, who had compassion for us has died, and so now we have no protector!’ They see that they are without a protector; they see that they have no refuge, and are overcome by sorrow.</p>
<p>“Through becoming overcome by sorrow, those whose perceptions are deluded gain undeluded perception. Then they can perceive the color, aroma, and taste of the medicine’s color, aroma, and taste, and at that time they drink it. Once they have drunk it they become free from their illness. When the physician knows that his sons have been cured he then reveals himself to them.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, what do you think? Should someone who has used such a skillful method be called a liar?”</p>
<p>“No, Bhagavān,” they answered. “No, Sugata.”</p>
<p>“Noble ones,” he continued, “in the same way, although I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood countless, innumerable hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago, I sometimes teach as a skillful method such as this in order to guide beings. In this matter, I am not in any way a liar.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān taught the meaning of this extensively in verses:</p>
<p>“Countless thousands of millions of eons ago,</p>
<p>A length of time that is inconceivable,</p>
<p>I attained the highest enlightenment</p>
<p>And I am always teaching the Dharma. {1}</p>
<p>“I inspired these numerous bodhisattvas</p>
<p>And directed them toward the wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>Throughout millions of eons I have ripened</p>
<p>Endless quintillions of beings. {2}</p>
<p>“I speak skillfully in order to guide beings:</p>
<p>I teach them the level of nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>In this time I do not pass into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>But will continue to teach the Dharma here. {3}</p>
<p>“In that time I empower myself,</p>
<p>And I similarly empower all beings.</p>
<p>Foolish humans, whose understanding is false,</p>
<p>Do not see me, even though I am present there. {4}</p>
<p>“They see me physically pass into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And they make offerings to my remains.</p>
<p>Because they do not see me, they yearn for me</p>
<p>And therefore their minds become corrected. {5}</p>
<p>“When they have become gentle, kind, and honest</p>
<p>And they forsake even their own bodies,</p>
<p>Then they become my saṅgha of śrāvakas</p>
<p>And I will reveal myself to them on Vulture Peak. {6}</p>
<p>“There I will say this to my followers:</p>
<p>‘I did not pass into nirvāṇa here;</p>
<p>Bhikṣus, that was my skillful method.</p>
<p>I appear again and again in the world of the living. {7}</p>
<p>“ ‘I have been before other beings</p>
<p>And taught them this highest enlightenment.</p>
<p>You could not hear those words of mine,</p>
<p>But other than that I did not pass into nirvāṇa. {8}</p>
<p>“ ‘I see the beings who undergo destruction,</p>
<p>But I do not reveal my form to them.</p>
<p>When they aspire to see me,</p>
<p>Then I teach the Dharma to those thirsty ones.’ {9}</p>
<p>“I always have that kind of blessing</p>
<p>Throughout countless billions of eons.</p>
<p>I do not depart from Vulture Peak,</p>
<p>And yet I have millions of other seats. {10}</p>
<p>“While beings see and think</p>
<p>That this world realm is burning,</p>
<p>At that time this buddha realm of mine</p>
<p>Is filled with maruts and humans. {11}</p>
<p>“They have various kinds of delights and joys there,</p>
<p>With millions of gardens, mansions, and airborne palaces.</p>
<p>It is adorned by mountains made of jewels</p>
<p>And by trees covered with blossoms and fruits. {12}</p>
<p>“Above, the devas are beating their great drums</p>
<p>And sending down a rain of coral tree flowers.</p>
<p>They scatter them over myself and the śrāvakas</p>
<p>And other wise ones who are fixed upon enlightenment. {13}</p>
<p>“This realm of mine remains constantly like this</p>
<p>While others conceive that it is burning.</p>
<p>They see the world as being terrifying</p>
<p>And filled with calamities and hundreds of miseries. {14}</p>
<p>“For many millions of years</p>
<p>They never hear even the name of the tathāgatas</p>
<p>Or the Dharma or my followers.</p>
<p>That is the result of their bad karma. {15}</p>
<p>“When gentle and kind beings</p>
<p>Are born in this human world,</p>
<p>As soon as they are born, through good karma,</p>
<p>They will see me teaching the Dharma. {16}</p>
<p>“I never say anything to them</p>
<p>Of these my endless activities.</p>
<p>It is a long time since they have seen me,</p>
<p>And I say it is rare to find the jinas. {17}</p>
<p>“I have the power of wisdom in this way;</p>
<p>It is a brilliance that is infinite.</p>
<p>My lifespan is that of infinite eons,</p>
<p>Which I have gained through my past conduct. {18}</p>
<p>“Wise ones, do not have any doubt about this.</p>
<p>You should dismiss every kind of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The words that I am speaking are the truth.</p>
<p>In my speech there are never any lies. {19}</p>
<p>“Like a physician who is skilled in methods</p>
<p>Who, because his sons have deluded perception,</p>
<p>While he is alive says that he has died,</p>
<p>The wise know that this would not be proclaimed a lie. {20}</p>
<p>“In that way, I am the self-arisen father of the world,</p>
<p>The Lord who is a physician for all beings.</p>
<p>Knowing that the ignorant fools are deluded,</p>
<p>I who have not passed into nirvāṇa manifest passing. {21}</p>
<p>“For what reason? Through constantly seeing me</p>
<p>The unwise and ignorant will become lazy.</p>
<p>They will be fearlessly careless in following their desires</p>
<p>And their recklessness will cause them to fall into lower existences. {22}</p>
<p>“At all times I know their various modes of conduct</p>
<p>And I say to them that I am like this or that</p>
<p>Because somehow I must bring them to enlightenment,</p>
<p>And somehow they must obtain the Buddha’s Dharma.” {23}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Lifespan of the Tathāgata,” the fifteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Extent of the Merit</p>
<p>Chapter 16</p>
<p>When the teaching of the Tathāgata’s lifespan was taught it benefited innumerable, countless beings. The Bhagavān said at that time to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, when the Dharma teaching that teaches the Tathāgata’s lifespan was given, a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas, as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty-eight Ganges Rivers, developed receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena.</p>
<p>“A thousand times more bodhisattva mahāsattvas than that attained the power of retention.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand worlds, heard this Dharma teaching and attained unimpeded eloquence.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a million worlds, heard this Dharma teaching and attained a hundred thousandfold power of retention.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a billion worlds, heard this Dharma teaching and turned the irreversible wheel.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in the intermediate thousandfold world realm, heard this Dharma teaching and turned the Dharma wheel called stainless light.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in the lesser thousandfold world realm, heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment after eight lifetimes.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in four four-continent world realms, heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment after four lifetimes.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in three four-continent world realms, heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment after three lifetimes.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in two four-continent world realms, heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment after two lifetimes.</p>
<p>“Other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, as numerous as the atoms in one four-continent world realm, heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment in one lifetime.</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the atoms in eight world realms of a thousand million worlds heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment.”</p>
<p>As soon as the Bhagavān had taught this foundation, this understanding of the Dharma, to those bodhisattvas, in that moment, from the sky above there descended a great rainfall of coral tree flowers and great coral tree flowers. They were sprinkled and scattered over a hundred thousand quintillion buddhas seated on lion thrones at the foot of precious trees in a hundred thousand quintillion world realms.</p>
<p>They were sprinkled and scattered over the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa, who were both seated on lion thrones. They were sprinkled and scattered over the complete gathering of bodhisattvas. They were sprinkled and scattered over the fourfold assembly. Divine sandalwood and agarwood powders fell from the sky. There resounded from the sky above the beautiful, melodious, and gentle sounds of drums, without their being beaten. Hundreds of thousands of pairs of divine calico cloths fell from above. Short necklaces, long necklaces, flower garlands, precious jewels, and huge precious jewels were hung in every direction. Hundreds of thousands of censers made from precious materials and containing priceless incense moved around by themselves. Above each tathāgata, bodhisattva mahāsattvas in the sky held a tier of precious parasols that reached up to the realm of Brahmā. In this way, above all those hundred thousand quintillion buddhas, bodhisattva mahāsattvas in the sky held tiers of precious parasols, reaching as high as the realm of Brahmā. Each of them praised those tathāgatas with praises of the buddhas rendered into verse.</p>
<p>At that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata has proclaimed a wonderful Dharma</p>
<p>That we have never heard before:</p>
<p>The nature of the great power of the guides,</p>
<p>And the way in which their lifespans are infinite. {1}</p>
<p>“Having heard on this day such a Dharma</p>
<p>Being imparted directly from the Sugata,</p>
<p>Thousands of millions of beings,</p>
<p>The Guide of the World’s own progeny, are filled with joy. {2}</p>
<p>“Some are irreversibly fixed upon the highest enlightenment,</p>
<p>Some are established in the supreme retention,</p>
<p>Some are established in unimpeded eloquence,</p>
<p>And some in thousands of millions of retentions. {3}</p>
<p>“There are others, as numerous as the atoms in the world,</p>
<p>Who are established in the highest wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>Some will, after eight lifetimes,</p>
<p>Become jinas with infinite vision. {4}</p>
<p>“Having heard this Dharma of the Guide,</p>
<p>Some, after four lives have passed,</p>
<p>Some others after two or three,</p>
<p>Will attain enlightenment and see the ultimate truth. {5}</p>
<p>“Some, after living one lifetime,</p>
<p>Will in another existence become omniscient.</p>
<p>Having heard the length of the Guide’s lifespan,</p>
<p>They will attain such an immaculate result. {6}</p>
<p>“The millions of beings who have heard the Dharma,</p>
<p>As numerous as the atoms in eight realms,</p>
<p>Whose numbers are incalculable,</p>
<p>Have developed the aspiration for supreme enlightenment. {7}</p>
<p>“By teaching this enlightenment of buddhahood</p>
<p>The great Rishi has accomplished an action</p>
<p>That is infinite, and that is immeasurable—</p>
<p>As immeasurable as the element of space. {8}</p>
<p>“A rain of coral tree flowers has fallen.</p>
<p>Many thousands of millions of devas,</p>
<p>Śakras, and Brahmās as numerous as the Ganges sands</p>
<p>Have come from thousands of millions of realms. {9}</p>
<p>“They sprinkle powder of sandalwood,</p>
<p>Of the best incenses, and the powder of agarwood.</p>
<p>While moving like birds through the sky,</p>
<p>They have appropriately sprinkled them on the Lords of Jinas. {10}</p>
<p>“From the sky above there has resounded</p>
<p>The beautiful sound of drums without their being beaten.</p>
<p>Thousands of millions of divine calico cloths</p>
<p>Encircle and are tossed upon the guides. {11}</p>
<p>“Incense of a priceless value,</p>
<p>In billions of precious censers,</p>
<p>As offerings to the Protector, the Lord of the World,</p>
<p>Move around everywhere by themselves. {12}</p>
<p>“Endless quintillions of parasols,</p>
<p>Tall, vast, and made of precious materials,</p>
<p>In great numbers reaching as high as Brahmā’s realm,</p>
<p>Are held by wise bodhisattvas. {13}</p>
<p>“Beautiful banners of victory</p>
<p>Are hoisted as the banners of the guides.</p>
<p>The offspring of the Sugata, filled with joy,</p>
<p>Praise him with thousands of verses. {14}</p>
<p>“Today, Guide, these various kinds</p>
<p>Of wondrous and superior marvels have occurred.</p>
<p>Through teaching the extent of your lifespan</p>
<p>All these beings have attained perfect joy. {15}</p>
<p>“Today there has been in the ten directions</p>
<p>A vast meaning, the superior words of the guides,</p>
<p>Bringing contentment to billions of beings,</p>
<p>Possessing virtue for the sake of enlightenment.” {16}</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, those beings who have just once developed aspiration, developed motivation, or gained faith when this Dharma teaching that teaches the extent of the lifespan of the Tathāgata was taught, how much merit have such noble men or noble women created? Listen well and remember, for I shall explain how much merit they have created.</p>
<p>“Ajita, it is like this: If a noble man or noble woman, wishing for the highest, complete enlightenment, were to practice, for eight hundred thousand quintillion eons, the five perfections, which are the perfection of generosity, the perfection of correct conduct, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, and the perfection of meditation, without the perfection of wisdom, and, Ajita, if there were a noble man or noble woman who had one time developed aspiration, developed motivation, or gained faith when this Dharma teaching that teaches the extent of the lifespan of the Tathāgata was taught, then that former accumulation of the roots of merit—the merit accumulated by completing the five perfections during eight hundred thousand quintillion eons—would not equal a hundredth part, not a thousandth, not a hundred thousandth, not a ten millionth, not a thousand millionth, not ten thousand millionth, not a million millionth, and not even a hundred thousand quintillionth part. The merit could not be calculated; even a fraction of it could not be calculated—there is no suitable analogy for it, and there is no suitable simile for it.</p>
<p>“Ajita, it is impossible for the progress toward the highest, complete enlightenment made by a noble man or noble woman who possesses such an accumulation of merit to be reversible.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“If a person were to make the commitment</p>
<p>To practicing the five perfections</p>
<p>In order to seek this wisdom,</p>
<p>Buddhahood’s unsurpassable wisdom, {17}</p>
<p>“And were even to practice them</p>
<p>For an entire eighty billion eons,</p>
<p>Repeatedly making gifts</p>
<p>To the buddhas and śrāvakas, {18}</p>
<p>“Pleasing pratyeka­buddhas</p>
<p>And millions of bodhisattvas</p>
<p>With food and drinks to eat and drink,</p>
<p>And also clothing and bedding and seats, {19}</p>
<p>“Building dwellings and temples</p>
<p>That were made from sandalwood,</p>
<p>And delightful gardens</p>
<p>And beautiful walking areas, {20}</p>
<p>“Giving these kinds of gifts</p>
<p>That are of many different kinds</p>
<p>For thousands of millions of eons,</p>
<p>Giving them in dedication to enlightenment; {21}</p>
<p>“And also, for the sake of buddhahood’s wisdom,</p>
<p>Maintaining correct conduct</p>
<p>And praising indefatigably</p>
<p>The buddhas with pure praises; {22}</p>
<p>“And also meditating on patience,</p>
<p>Being established on the level of discipline,</p>
<p>Being stable, and having mindfulness,</p>
<p>And being patient with criticism; {23}</p>
<p>“And for the sake of buddhahood’s wisdom</p>
<p>Enduring abuse from those</p>
<p>Beings who believe in objective reality</p>
<p>And who are fixed in their arrogance; {24}</p>
<p>“And also being always diligently dedicated,</p>
<p>Having stable mindfulness and application,</p>
<p>Without having a thought about anything else</p>
<p>For millions of eons; {25}</p>
<p>“And remaining in the forests,</p>
<p>Walking upon the walkways,</p>
<p>Practicing for ten million eons,</p>
<p>Forsaking sleep and sloth; {26}</p>
<p>“And having meditation, great meditation,</p>
<p>Delighting in meditation, and being concentrated,</p>
<p>Practicing meditation for no less</p>
<p>Than eighty thousand million eons— {27}</p>
<p>“That person who is a hero with that meditation,</p>
<p>And aspires for the highest enlightenment,</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘May I become omniscient!’</p>
<p>And reaches the perfection of meditation— {28}</p>
<p>“I have previously described</p>
<p>The merit that person will have</p>
<p>By maintaining that activity</p>
<p>For ten thousand million eons. {29}</p>
<p>“Yet a person, whether male or female,</p>
<p>Who has heard of this my lifespan</p>
<p>And has faith in it for even an instant</p>
<p>Will have merit that is limitless. {30}</p>
<p>“Rejecting doubts,</p>
<p>Deceit, and arrogance,</p>
<p>And aspiring for a moment,</p>
<p>Will have this kind of result. {31}</p>
<p>“When the bodhisattvas who have practiced</p>
<p>For ten million eons</p>
<p>Hear of my inconceivable lifespan,</p>
<p>They do not reject it. {32}</p>
<p>“They bow down their heads and say,</p>
<p>‘May I too in a future time</p>
<p>Become like this</p>
<p>And liberate millions of beings. {33}</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as Lord Śākyamuni,</p>
<p>The great Muni, the Śākya Lion,</p>
<p>Sat upon the Bodhimaṇḍa</p>
<p>And roared his lion’s roar, {34}</p>
<p>“ ‘May I too in a future time</p>
<p>Be honored by all beings</p>
<p>And, having sat on the Bodhimaṇḍa,</p>
<p>May I teach this kind of Dharma. {35}</p>
<p>“ ‘May those humans who hear and possess it</p>
<p>With a perfect, superior motivation</p>
<p>Know that the teaching has implied meaning,</p>
<p>And may they be free of any doubt.’ {36}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Ajita, if someone who hears, enters, follows, and comprehends this Dharma teaching that teaches the lifespan of the Tathāgata will generate a supremely incalculable accumulation of merit that leads to the wisdom of buddhahood, it goes without saying that someone who hears this kind of Dharma teaching, proclaims it, maintains it, writes it, has it written, and honors the text or has others honor it with flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, flags, sesame oil lamps, ghee lamps, and perfumed oil lamps will generate a far greater accumulation of merit that leads to the wisdom of buddhahood.</p>
<p>“Ajita, when a noble man or noble woman hears this Dharma teaching that teaches the lifespan of the Tathāgata and aspires to it with a superior motivation, know that their superior motivation has these characteristics: They see me at Vulture Peak, encircled and honored by an assembly of bodhisattvas, teaching the Dharma at the center of the saṅgha of śrāvakas. They see my buddha realm, this Sahā world realm, to have a ground made of beryl that is level, divided like a checkerboard with golden cords, and to be adorned by trees made of precious materials. They see bodhisattvas residing in perfectly enjoyable kūṭāgāras.</p>
<p>“Ajita, know these to be the characteristics of the superior motivation of the noble men or noble women who have aspiration with a superior motivation.</p>
<p>“Moreover, Ajita, I say that those noble ones who have a superior motivation are those who hear this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa and do not reject it, but rejoice in it, let alone those who maintain it and read it.</p>
<p>“Ajita, the noble man or noble woman who makes a text of this Dharma teaching and carries it on their shoulder is carrying the Tathāgata on their shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ajita, that noble man or noble woman does not need to build a stūpa for me, does not need to build a temple, nor do they need to give utensils to the saṅgha of bhikṣus, or medicine when they are ill.</p>
<p>“Why is that? Ajita, that noble man or noble woman will have made an offering to my body, having created a stūpa made of the seven precious materials that is as high as the realm of Brahmā, encircled by a circumambulatory walkway, with parasols upon it, with flags and ringing bells. They will have honored it in many ways with divine and human flowers, perfume, incense, garlands, ointments, powders, cloth, parasols, banners, flags, and flags of victory. For many countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons, they will have honored it with beautiful, melodious, clear sounds of many kinds of kettledrums, and large kettledrums; the sound of musical instruments and percussion; different kinds of song, dance, and amusements; and countless different kinds of music.</p>
<p>“Ajita, the one who after my passing into nirvāṇa possesses this Dharma teaching and reads it, writes it out, and teaches it, will for my sake have created a high, vast temple made of red sandalwood, with thirty-two mansions that have eight floors, as a residence for a thousand bhikṣus, with gardens beautified by flowers, with groves that have walkways, with beds and seats, filled with food and drink—hard food and soft food—and medicine for when there is illness, and adorned with things that bring happiness. They will have offered many of these, countless numbers of these—a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, ten million, a thousand million, a trillion, a hundred thousand quintillion—in my presence, to the saṅgha of śrāvakas, and it should be known that I will have enjoyed them.</p>
<p>“Ajita, I say that if someone possesses this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, and reads it, teaches it, writes it, or has someone write it, then because of this Dharma teaching there is no need for them to build a stūpa for my relics after I have passed into nirvāṇa, and no need to make an offering to the saṅgha, let alone, Ajita, someone who while possessing this Dharma teaching accomplishes generosity, correct conduct, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. That noble man or noble woman will generate an infinite, countless, innumerable aggregation of merit, Ajita, in the same way that the directions of east, south, west, north, above and below, and the intermediate directions in the element of space have no end.</p>
<p>“That noble man or noble woman who possesses this Dharma teaching, and reads it, teaches it, writes it, or has someone write it, accumulates an infinite, countless, innumerable aggregation of merit for the wisdom of buddhahood. They will be dedicated to honoring the caitya of the Tathāgata. They will recite the praises of the Tathāgata’s śrāvakas. They will describe the hundred thousand quintillion qualities of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas and teach them to others again and again.</p>
<p>“They will accomplish patience, possess correct conduct, and will delight in the company of those with virtuous qualities; they will be patient, self-controlled, without envy, free of anger, without malicious intentions, mindful, strong, diligent, and constantly dedicated to seeking the Buddha’s Dharma; they will be meditators, will be devoted to solitary meditation, will frequently be in solitary meditation, and be skilled in questions and discrimination, and able to answer a hundred thousand quintillion questions.</p>
<p>“Ajita, I have described the qualities of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who will maintain this Dharma teaching after I have passed into nirvāṇa, and that is what they will be like.</p>
<p>“Ajita, this is what a noble man or noble woman should know: That noble man or noble woman will be seated at the Bodhimaṇḍa. They will go to the foot of the Bodhi tree in order to attain the enlightenment of buddhahood.</p>
<p>“Ajita, wherever that noble man or noble woman stands, sits, or walks, there should be built a caitya for the Tathāgata. The world and its devas should say, ‘This is a caitya of the Tathāgata.’ ”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“I praise again and again</p>
<p>The limitless aggregation of merit</p>
<p>Of those who maintain this sūtra</p>
<p>When the Protector of Humans is in nirvāṇa. {37}</p>
<p>“Through that they make offerings to me,</p>
<p>And they create a lovely, beautiful</p>
<p>Variety of stūpas for my relics,</p>
<p>Which are made from precious materials. {38}</p>
<p>“They reach as high as the realms of Brahmā</p>
<p>And they are endowed with parasols and garlands.</p>
<p>They have glorious circumambulatory walkways</p>
<p>And they possess banners of victory. {39}</p>
<p>“The relics of the Jina are beautified</p>
<p>By the clear sound of bells,</p>
<p>The beauty of silken streamers,</p>
<p>And bells shaken by the breeze. {40}</p>
<p>“To them are made vast offerings</p>
<p>Of perfume, flowers, and garlands;</p>
<p>Cloths and the sound of music;</p>
<p>And by the sound of drums over and over. {41}</p>
<p>“The sweet sound of musical instruments</p>
<p>Is played for those relics.</p>
<p>Lamps of perfume, sesame oil, and ghee</p>
<p>Are completely offered to them all around. {42}</p>
<p>“The one who possesses this sūtra</p>
<p>And teaches it in the era of decline</p>
<p>Will, by so doing, have made</p>
<p>Such infinite and diverse offerings to me: {43}</p>
<p>“Numerous millions of temples</p>
<p>That are made from sandalwood,</p>
<p>With thirty-two mansions</p>
<p>That are eight floors high; {44}</p>
<p>“Thousands of residences</p>
<p>Provided with beds and seats,</p>
<p>An accumulation of food and drink,</p>
<p>And hung with excellent curtains; {45}</p>
<p>“And gardens and walkways are given,</p>
<p>Beautified by delightful flowers.</p>
<p>There are many awnings there</p>
<p>In a variety of different forms. {46}</p>
<p>“The one who possesses this sūtra</p>
<p>After the Guide has passed into nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Will have, in my presence,</p>
<p>Made many offerings to the saṅgha. {47}</p>
<p>“The one who reads this sūtra,</p>
<p>Or one who writes it out</p>
<p>While filled with aspiration,</p>
<p>Will attain even greater merit. {48}</p>
<p>“The person who has it written out</p>
<p>In a volume with correct words,</p>
<p>And makes offerings to the text</p>
<p>With perfumes, garlands, and ointments, {49}</p>
<p>“Who continually makes offerings of lamps</p>
<p>That are filled with perfumed sesame oil</p>
<p>And scatters upon it the petals of</p>
<p>Royal jasmine, blue lotuses, and magnolias— {50}</p>
<p>“That person who makes offerings</p>
<p>In that manner to those texts</p>
<p>Will generate much merit,</p>
<p>Which will be beyond measure. {51}</p>
<p>“Just as the extent of space</p>
<p>Can never be discovered</p>
<p>Throughout all the ten directions,</p>
<p>So will be this accumulation of merit. {52}</p>
<p>“And it goes without saying that it will be so</p>
<p>For those who also have patience, self-control,</p>
<p>Concentration, correct conduct, meditation,</p>
<p>And practice solitary contemplation. {53}</p>
<p>“Without anger, without slander,</p>
<p>They remain in veneration to the caitya,</p>
<p>Always bowing to the bhikṣus</p>
<p>Without pride and without laziness. {54}</p>
<p>“Endowed with wisdom and likewise stable,</p>
<p>They ask questions and do not become angry.</p>
<p>They have compassion for beings</p>
<p>And teach them in an appropriate manner. {55}</p>
<p>“For those who will be like that</p>
<p>And who possess this sūtra,</p>
<p>There will be an aggregation of merit</p>
<p>The extent of which can never be measured. {56}</p>
<p>“If someone were to see</p>
<p>Such dharmabhāṇakas</p>
<p>Who possess this sūtra</p>
<p>They will treat them with reverence. {57}</p>
<p>“They will scatter divine flowers upon them.</p>
<p>They will wrap them in divine cloth.</p>
<p>They will bow their heads to their feet,</p>
<p>And will perceive them to be a tathāgata. {58}</p>
<p>“Seeing them they will at that time think,</p>
<p>‘That one will go to the foot of a tree</p>
<p>And in order to benefit the world and its devas</p>
<p>Will attain the highest enlightenment of buddhahood.’ {59}</p>
<p>“Someone who recites one verse from this sūtra</p>
<p>Where those kinds of wise people walk,</p>
<p>Wherever they stand, or wherever they sit,</p>
<p>Or wherever those heroes makes their bed, {60}</p>
<p>“In those places there should be built</p>
<p>Various beautiful stūpas of the highest being,</p>
<p>For the Guide, the Buddha, the Bhagavān,</p>
<p>And a variety of offerings should be made to it. {61}</p>
<p>“I also will have enjoyed that place</p>
<p>Where those bodhisattvas resided.</p>
<p>I myself will have walked there,</p>
<p>And I myself will have sat there.” {62}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Extent of the Merit,” the sixteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Teaching the Merit of Rejoicing</p>
<p>Chapter 17</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, if a noble man or noble woman rejoices after hearing this Dharma teaching explained, how much merit, Bhagavān, does that noble man or noble woman create?” And at that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya also addressed to him this verse:</p>
<p>“After the nirvāṇa of the great Hero,</p>
<p>How much merit will there be</p>
<p>For someone who listens to this kind of sūtra,</p>
<p>And having heard it, rejoices?” {1}</p>
<p>The Bhagavān then answered the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, suppose there are noble men or noble women, bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas or upāsikās, wise adults, boys or girls who listen to this Dharma teaching being given, and having heard it, rejoice. And having listened to the Dharma they get up and leave, and whether they go to a temple, a house, a forest, a street, a town, or the countryside, they explain those causes, those causal factors, that Dharma, to other beings just as they have heard it, just as they remember it, to the extent of their ability, whether it be to their father, mother, or relative, and to anyone else who will be pleased, with whom they are acquainted. Then suppose those other beings rejoice on having heard it, and having rejoiced they tell it to others who will rejoice on hearing it, and then those tell it to others, so that this Dharma teaching is passed on from one to another until it reaches a fiftieth person.</p>
<p>“Ajita, thus suppose there is a person who is the fiftieth to hear it and rejoice after it has been passed on from one to another. Ajita, I shall describe the merit that is accumulated through such a noble man or noble woman’s rejoicing, so listen well and remember.</p>
<p>“Ajita, it is like this: Suppose there are four hundred thousand innumerable world realms in which there are beings that have been born into the six kinds of existence: that have been born from eggs, born from wombs, born from warm moisture, or born miraculously; beings with form and without form; beings with perception, without perception, and neither with nor without perception; beings with no legs, with two legs, with four legs, or with many legs—an entire multitude of beings that are included within that realm of beings, that have entered that realm of beings. Then a man appears there who wishes to create merit, who wishes to benefit others, and who gives to that multitude of beings lovely, beautiful, cherished, desired pleasures and enjoyments of happiness. In order that each of the beings that fill Jambudvīpa might enjoy what they desire, what they delight in, and what they take pleasure in, he gives them cowries, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, corals, horse-drawn carriages, ox-drawn carriages, elephant-drawn carriages, palaces, and kūṭāgāras.</p>
<p>“Ajita, this man, this lord of generosity, this lord of great generosity, gives these gifts in that way for eighty years. Then, Ajita, this man, this lord of generosity, this lord of great generosity thinks, ‘I have brought all these beings delights, pleasures, and happiness. These beings have now become old. They have white hair, are covered with wrinkles, are eighty years old and they are close to the time of their deaths. I shall introduce them to the Dharma’s guidance that has been taught by the Tathāgata and teach it to them.’</p>
<p>“Then, Ajita, that man introduces those beings to the Dharma’s guidance that has been taught by the Tathāgata, and when they have been introduced to the Dharma they listen to it, and having heard it for just one moment, just one instant, briefly, they attain the results of becoming stream entrants, once-returners, and nonreturners, up to becoming arhats, who have brought the defilements to cessation, become meditators, great meditators, and meditate on the eight liberations.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Ajita? Would this man, this lord of generosity, this lord of great generosity, have generated vast countless immeasurable merit through that as a cause?”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya replied to the Bhagavān, “It is so, Bhagavān. It is so, Sugata. That man, that lord of generosity, that lord of great generosity, would have generated vast merit through that causal factor, through giving to those beings the things that bring happiness—not to speak, Bhagavān, of establishing them in the higher state of arhathood.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Ajita, I declare this to you, I make this known to you. There is the merit generated by that man, that lord of generosity, that lord of great generosity through providing the things that brought happiness to all the beings in four hundred thousand countless world realms, and establishing them in arhathood. There is also the amount of merit generated by the fiftieth person who heard and rejoiced in just one verse from this Dharma teaching, or rejoiced in just one line, after it had been passed from one to another. The amount of merit possessed by that person who rejoiced—who rejoiced in just one verse from this Dharma teaching or rejoiced in just one line—after it had been passed from one to another fifty times, would be far greater than the amount of merit gained by that man, that lord of generosity, that lord of great generosity through his generosity and establishing beings in arhathood.</p>
<p>“Ajita, the accumulation of merit through generosity and establishing beings in arhathood that was previously described does not equal a hundredth of the merit, of the good karma, accumulated from that rejoicing. It does not equal a thousandth, a hundred thousandth, a ten millionth, a thousand millionth, a ten thousand millionth, a million millionth, or even a hundred thousand quintillionth. That merit cannot be calculated—even a fraction of it cannot be calculated; there is no suitable analogy for it, and there is no suitable simile for it.</p>
<p>“Ajita, that is the amount of merit generated by rejoicing in one verse or one line from this Dharma teaching by that fiftieth person, Ajita, not to mention someone who in my presence hears and rejoices in this Dharma teaching. Ajita, I teach that the accumulation of such merit is immeasurable, unquantifiable.</p>
<p>“Ajita, the noble man or noble woman who, in order to listen to this Dharma teaching, leaves their home and goes to a temple, and having arrived there, whether standing or sitting, listens briefly to this Dharma teaching will create and accumulate such an accumulation of merit. Then when they depart from that life, in their next lifetime, they will have a life in which they acquire ox-drawn carriages, horse-drawn carriages, elephant-drawn carriages, palanquins, boats, bull-drawn carriages, and the airborne palaces of a deity.</p>
<p>“If they sit down for just a moment where the Dharma of the sūtra is being taught and listen to this Dharma teaching, or make another person sit down, or share their seat with another being, through that merit they accumulate they will attain the throne of Śakra, the throne of Brahmā, and the lion throne of a cakravartin.</p>
<p>“Ajita, if a noble man or noble woman says to another person, ‘Hey, come here! Listen to this Dharma teaching called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma!’ and if that person is inspired and comes, and if they listen for just a moment, through the roots of merit that are accumulated through having inspired that being, the noble man or woman will be among the company of bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have attained retention. They will not be stupid. They will have sharp faculties and be wise. For a hundred thousand lifetimes they will not have a foul-smelling mouth, bad breath, illness of the tongue, illness of the mouth, blackened teeth, uneven teeth, yellow teeth, disarranged teeth, broken teeth, lost teeth, crooked teeth, a prominent lower lip, thin lips, too wide lips, a cleft lip, crooked lips, dark lips, ugly lips, a flat nose, a crooked nose, a long face, a crooked face, a black face, or an ugly face.</p>
<p>“Ajita, in that way they will have delicate and well-formed tongues, teeth, and lips, a prominent nose, a beautifully shaped face, lovely eyebrows, a well-formed forehead, and they will attain the complete features of a superior being. They will find the Tathāgata and the instructions he teaches, and will quickly be among the company of the buddha bhagavāns.</p>
<p>“Ajita, see the amount of merit that is generated by inspiring just one being, let alone by one who respectfully listens to, respectfully reads, respectfully teaches, and respectfully elucidates this Dharma teaching.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Listen to the extent of merit that arises</p>
<p>When someone hears one verse of this sūtra</p>
<p>And is the fiftieth in its transmission from one to another,</p>
<p>And having heard it appreciates it and rejoices. {2}</p>
<p>“As in the parable that I have previously narrated,</p>
<p>There appears a person who is a lord of generosity</p>
<p>Who for eighty years, continually,</p>
<p>Brings satisfaction to a quintillion beings. {3}</p>
<p>“Then, when he sees that they have become old,</p>
<p>Covered in wrinkles, and their hair has turned white</p>
<p>He thinks, ‘Oh, I shall teach the Dharma</p>
<p>To all of these afflicted beings!’ {4}</p>
<p>“He subsequently teaches them the Dharma,</p>
<p>Telling them of the state of nirvāṇa:</p>
<p>‘All existences are like foam and mirages.</p>
<p>Quickly turn your minds away from all existences!’ {5}</p>
<p>“All those beings, having heard the Dharma</p>
<p>Directly from that man of generosity,</p>
<p>Cease their defilements and in that last life of theirs</p>
<p>They all simultaneously attain arhathood. {6}</p>
<p>“The amount of merit that comes from rejoicing</p>
<p>On hearing a single verse that has been passed on from one to another,</p>
<p>That amount of merit is far greater than the merit previously described,</p>
<p>Which does not equal even a fraction of it. {7}</p>
<p>“In that way there is a vast amount of merit</p>
<p>That is limitless, that is beyond measure,</p>
<p>For one who hears one verse that has been passed on,</p>
<p>Let alone someone who has heard it directly from me. {8}</p>
<p>“If someone inspires just one being</p>
<p>By saying, ‘This sūtra is very hard to find,</p>
<p>Even in many quintillions of eons,</p>
<p>So come and listen to the Dharma!’ {9}</p>
<p>“And if that being, having been inspired,</p>
<p>Listens for a moment to this sūtra,</p>
<p>Then hear what are the results of that action: {10}</p>
<p>They will never have a malady of the mouth,</p>
<p>“Their tongue will never be affected by illness,</p>
<p>They will never lose their teeth,</p>
<p>Which will not be black, yellow, uneven, or crooked,</p>
<p>And they will never have ugly lips. {11}</p>
<p>“Their face will not be crooked, thin, or long,</p>
<p>And they will never have a flat nose.</p>
<p>Their nose, forehead, teeth, lips, and face</p>
<p>Will all be perfectly formed. {12}</p>
<p>“People will see them as attractive.</p>
<p>There will be no rotten smell from their mouth,</p>
<p>But always a pleasant scent like a blue lotus—</p>
<p>That is the aroma that will come from their mouth. {13}</p>
<p>“If heroes go from their home to the temple,</p>
<p>Arriving there in order to listen to the sūtra,</p>
<p>And having arrived there, listen to the Dharma briefly,</p>
<p>The result of having such faith is as follows: {14}</p>
<p>“They will have a body that will be very white.</p>
<p>Those constant ones will travel by horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>They will travel seated in an elephant-drawn carriage</p>
<p>That is adorned by jewels. {15}</p>
<p>“They will obtain an adorned palanquin</p>
<p>That will be carried by many men.</p>
<p>This is the kind of result of good karma</p>
<p>That comes from going to listen to the Dharma. {16}</p>
<p>“Through the good karma that is created</p>
<p>By being seated in the midst of the assembly,</p>
<p>They will attain the throne of Brahmā,</p>
<p>The throne of a king, and the throne of Śakra.” {17}</p>
<p>This concludes “Teaching the Merit of Rejoicing,” the seventeenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Benefits of the Purity of the Six Āyatanas</p>
<p>Chapter 18</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Satata­samitābhiyukta, “If any noble man or noble woman possesses, reads, teaches, or asks questions about this Dharma teaching, that noble man or noble woman will gain eight hundred qualities of the eyes, will gain twelve hundred qualities of the nose, will gain eight hundred qualities of the ears, will gain twelve hundred qualities of the tongue, will gain eight hundred qualities of the body, and will gain twelve hundred qualities of mind.</p>
<p>“Through those many hundreds of qualities the combination of the six sensory faculties will be purified, completely purified. The purified faculty of the eye, the ordinary physical eyes that have come from the father and mother, will see the outside and inside of the world realm of a thousand million worlds, with its mountains and forests, seeing all as far down as the Avīci hell and as far upward as the summit of existence. With ordinary eyes of flesh they will see all the birthplaces of beings, and know the ripening of their karma.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Hear from me what are the qualities in store</p>
<p>For those who fearlessly teach this sūtra</p>
<p>In the middle of an assembly,</p>
<p>Teaching it without idleness. {1}</p>
<p>“Their eyes will be beautified</p>
<p>By eight hundred qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore those eyes will be stainless,</p>
<p>Unpolluted, and pure. {2}</p>
<p>“With the physical eyes</p>
<p>That have come from their parents</p>
<p>They will see the entire world realm,</p>
<p>From the outside and from the inside. {3}</p>
<p>“They will see all of the Merus,</p>
<p>Sumerus, and Cakravālas;</p>
<p>So, too, will they also see</p>
<p>The other well-known mountains, and the oceans. {4}</p>
<p>“Those wise ones will see everything,</p>
<p>From as far down as the Avīci hell</p>
<p>To as high up as the summit of existence;</p>
<p>That is what their physical eyes will be like. {5}</p>
<p>“They will still not have divine eyes</p>
<p>And so they will not have that knowledge.</p>
<p>But that is the way it will be</p>
<p>For the field of vision of their physical eyes. {6}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Satata­samitābhiyukta, the noble man or noble woman who teaches and explains to others this Dharma teaching will have those twelve hundred qualities of the ears. They will hear all the outer and inner sounds that arise in the world realm of a thousand million worlds, from as far down as the Avīci hell to as high up as the summit of existence, such as the sounds of elephants, the sounds of horses, the sounds of camels, the sounds of oxen, the sounds of goats, the sounds of carts, the sounds of weeping, the sounds of misery, the sounds of fear, the sounds of conches, the sounds of bells, the sounds of drums, the sounds of play, the sounds of song, the sounds of music, the sounds of men, the sounds of women, the sounds of boys, the sounds of girls, the sounds of the Dharma, the sounds of that which is not the Dharma, the sounds of happiness, the sounds of suffering, the sounds of fools, the sounds of the āryas, the sounds that are pleasant, the sounds that are unpleasant, the sounds of devas, the sounds of nāgas, the sounds of yakṣas, the sounds of gandharvas, the sounds of asuras, the sounds of garuḍas, the sounds of kinnaras, the sounds of fire, the sounds of water, the sounds of the air, the sounds of villages, the sounds of towns, the sounds of bhikṣus, the sounds of śrāvakas, the sounds of pratyeka­buddhas, the sounds of bodhisattvas, and the sounds of tathāgatas—all the sounds that arise outside and inside within a world realm of a thousand million worlds.</p>
<p>“Although they will not yet have accomplished divine hearing, they will understand the sounds of each and every being and be able to differentiate them and understand them by listening with that ordinary faculty of the ears. That faculty of the ears will hear the sounds that the various beings make but the faculty of hearing will not be overwhelmed by all those sounds. Satata­samitābhiyukta, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas will acquire that kind of sense of hearing, but will not yet at that time have attained divine hearing.”</p>
<p>As soon as the Tathāgata had said these words, the Teacher added these verses:</p>
<p>“Their ordinary faculty of hearing</p>
<p>Will becomes unpolluted and purified</p>
<p>And they will hear without exception</p>
<p>The many different sounds in this world realm. {7}</p>
<p>“They will hear the sounds of elephants and horses,</p>
<p>And of carriages, oxen, goats, and sheep,</p>
<p>Of bherī drums and mṛdaṅga drums,</p>
<p>Vīṇas, flutes, and vallakīs. {8}</p>
<p>“They will hear sweet, melodious song,</p>
<p>But the constant ones will have no attachment.</p>
<p>They will hear the millions of voices of humans,</p>
<p>Whatever they say and wherever they say it. {9}</p>
<p>“They will continually hear the voices of the devas</p>
<p>And their sweet and melodious songs.</p>
<p>They will hear the voices of men and women,</p>
<p>And also the voices of boys and girls. {10}</p>
<p>“They will hear where they are the beautiful songs</p>
<p>Of cuckoos, peacocks, and avadavats,</p>
<p>Partridges and other birds</p>
<p>Living in the mountains or in caves. {11}</p>
<p>“They will hear the dreadful cries</p>
<p>Of beings who are suffering in the hells</p>
<p>And the sounds that are made by pretas</p>
<p>Tormented by the suffering of no food. {12}</p>
<p>“They will hear the voices of the asuras,</p>
<p>Those who dwell in the ocean, and others.</p>
<p>Those dharmabhāṇakas, while staying where they are,</p>
<p>Will hear all those sounds without being overwhelmed. {13}</p>
<p>“While staying where they are they will hear</p>
<p>The multitude of different sounds</p>
<p>That those born as animals make</p>
<p>When they communicate with each other. {14}</p>
<p>“They will hear, without exception,</p>
<p>All that is said between the devas</p>
<p>In the realm of Brahmā,</p>
<p>In Akaniṣṭha, and Ābhāsvara. {15}</p>
<p>“They will continually hear the voices</p>
<p>Of those bhikṣus who are mendicants in the Sugata’s teaching</p>
<p>And are performing their daily recitation,</p>
<p>And those who are teaching the Dharma to assemblies. {16}</p>
<p>“They will hear separately all the voices</p>
<p>Of bodhisattvas in this world realm</p>
<p>Doing daily recitations or speaking with each other,</p>
<p>And whatever it is they say about the Dharma. {17}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas who possess this sūtra</p>
<p>Will also hear at the very same time</p>
<p>A buddha bhagavān, a trainer and leader of beings,</p>
<p>Teaching the highest Dharma to his assembly. {18}</p>
<p>“The multitude of sounds that beings emit</p>
<p>Throughout all these thousand million worlds,</p>
<p>Whether they are inside somewhere or outside,</p>
<p>As far down as Avīci and up to the summit of existence, {19}</p>
<p>“They will hear all those sounds made by beings</p>
<p>Without their hearing being obstructed.</p>
<p>Their faculty will be clear and they will know each place of origin,</p>
<p>And that will be the nature of their ordinary hearing faculty. {20}</p>
<p>“They will not yet have the divine hearing;</p>
<p>Their ordinary hearing faculty will be like this.</p>
<p>The ones who fearlessly possess this sūtra</p>
<p>Will acquire such qualities as these. {21}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Satata­samitābhiyukta, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possess this Dharma teaching, teach it, recite it, or write it will have the eight hundred qualities of the nose; the sensory faculty of their nose will be completely purified.</p>
<p>“That completely pure nasal faculty will sense the multitude of different smells, both inside and outside in the world realm of a thousand million worlds, such as rotten smells, pleasant smells, and unpleasant smells.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scents of different flowers, namely, the scents of royal jasmine, jasmine, magnolias, and bignonia flowers.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scent of water-borne flowers, namely, the scents of blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scent of the flowers of various fruit- and flower-bearing trees, and the scent of fruits, namely, the scents of sandalwood, bay leaves, valerian, and agarwood.</p>
<p>“If there are a hundred thousand aromas in one place they will smell them all and know them all.</p>
<p>“They will also smell the many different scents of animals, namely, the scents of elephants, horses, oxen, goats, sheep, and cattle.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scents of the bodies of many different kinds of creatures reborn as animals.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scents of the bodies of men and of women. They will smell the scents of the bodies of boys and girls. They will smell the scents of grasses, bushes, herbs, and forests that are far away. They will smell them correctly and know what they are, but they will not be fascinated by those smells; they will not be intoxicated by them.</p>
<p>“While being here in this world, they will smell the scents of the devas, namely, the scents of the divine night-flowering jasmine, orchid tree, coral tree, great coral tree, spider lily, and great spider lily flowers. They will smell the scents of a hundred thousand different kinds of divine flowers and know their names.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scents of the bodies of the devas; namely, they will smell the scent of the body of Śakra, lord of devas, and know if he is enjoying amusements and pleasures in Vaijayanta, his palace; if he is teaching the Dharma to the devas of Trāyastriṃśa in Sudharma, the assembly hall of the devas; or if he has come into the park there for pleasure. They will also smell the scents of the bodies of other devas. They will also smell the scents of the bodies of the deva maidens and the deva wives. They will also smell the scents of the bodies of the deva boys. They will also smell the scents of the bodies of the deva girls. They will not be fascinated by those smells, or intoxicated by them.</p>
<p>“In that way they will smell the scents of the bodies of beings up to the summit of existence. They will smell the scents of bodies of the Brahmakāyika devas and of the Mahābrahmās. In that way they will smell the scents of the bodies of all classes of devas.</p>
<p>“They will smell the scents of the bodies of śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, bodhisattvas, and tathāgatas. They will smell the scents of the thrones of the tathāgatas. They will know where the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas are seated. Their nasal faculty will not be overwhelmed, impaired, or damaged by those multitudes of smells.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“The nasal faculty will be purified</p>
<p>And they will smell the many kinds of smells,</p>
<p>The pleasant and unpleasant smells that there are</p>
<p>In this entire realm of worlds, {22}</p>
<p>“The scent of jasmine and royal jasmine,</p>
<p>Sandalwood and bay leaves,</p>
<p>Valerian and agarwood,</p>
<p>And many kinds of flowers and fruits. {23}</p>
<p>“In that way they will know the smells of beings,</p>
<p>Those of men and of women who are far away.</p>
<p>And by the smells of boys and of girls</p>
<p>They will know where they are located. {24}</p>
<p>“They will know the smells of cakravartin kings,</p>
<p>Bala­cakra­vartin kings, and rulers of regions.</p>
<p>In the same way they will know the smells of</p>
<p>The princes, the princesses, and the harems. {25}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas will know through their smells</p>
<p>The many kinds of jewels that are enjoyed:</p>
<p>Those that have been deposited under the ground</p>
<p>And those that are owned by women. {26}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas will know through their smells</p>
<p>Whatever are used as adornments,</p>
<p>The different materials that are worn on the body:</p>
<p>Clothing, garlands, ointments, and perfumes. {27}</p>
<p>“The ones who possess this supreme sūtra,</p>
<p>Those resolute ones will know through the power of smell</p>
<p>All who are standing, sitting, or lying down,</p>
<p>Enjoying pleasures, or in possession of miraculous powers. {28}</p>
<p>“Similarly, they will instantly smell</p>
<p>The aroma of perfumed sesame oil</p>
<p>And the various aromas of fruits and flowers,</p>
<p>And know the particular places those aromas are. {29}</p>
<p>“The wise ones will know from their scents</p>
<p>The multitudes of blossomed sandalwood trees</p>
<p>In the various declivities of mountains,</p>
<p>And the various beings that dwell among them. {30}</p>
<p>“The wise ones will know from their scents</p>
<p>Those beings who dwell on the Cakravāla mountains,</p>
<p>Those who dwell in the middle of the ocean,</p>
<p>And those who dwell in the center of the earth. {31}</p>
<p>“In that way, through the power of their nose</p>
<p>They will know the devas and asuras,</p>
<p>And they will know the asura maidens,</p>
<p>And know the delights of the asuras. {32}</p>
<p>“Through their sense of smell they will know the dwellings</p>
<p>Of the four-legged animals in the forests:</p>
<p>The lions, tigers, and likewise, supreme elephants,</p>
<p>Wild water buffalo, oxen, and gaurs. {33}</p>
<p>“They will know through their smells</p>
<p>Those women who are pregnant</p>
<p>And whether it is a boy or a girl</p>
<p>Carried inside their weary bodies. {34}</p>
<p>“They will know that a being has entered the womb.</p>
<p>They will know if that being is going to be destroyed.</p>
<p>They will know if the woman is going to be free of suffering</p>
<p>And will give birth to a meritorious boy. {35}</p>
<p>“In that way they will smell the aromas of wishes</p>
<p>And know the many wishes of people.</p>
<p>They will also smell the aromas of desire,</p>
<p>Anger, hypocrisy, and peaceful minds. {36}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas will know from their aromas</p>
<p>Whatever treasures there are in the earth:</p>
<p>Chests of iron that are filled with wealth—</p>
<p>With gold, with silver, and with cowries. {37}</p>
<p>“They will know through their aromas</p>
<p>All pearls, jewels, short and long necklaces,</p>
<p>Priceless jewels of many kinds,</p>
<p>And their names and lusters. {38}</p>
<p>“In the same way, the heroes, while in this world,</p>
<p>Will smell the divine flowers that are above,</p>
<p>Which are the coral tree, the spider lily,</p>
<p>And the night-flowering jasmine flowers. {39}</p>
<p>“While in this world, through their nasal faculty</p>
<p>They will smell the aromas of the airborne palaces,</p>
<p>The greater, the medium, and the lesser,</p>
<p>And whatever kinds of forms they have. {40}</p>
<p>“They will know also where the devas are—</p>
<p>The park, Sudharma, or Vaijayanta—</p>
<p>And in that way know the excellent palaces</p>
<p>In which the devas are enjoying delights. {41}</p>
<p>“While in this world, through smelling aromas</p>
<p>They will know through those aromas</p>
<p>Where the devas are and what they are doing,</p>
<p>Whether they are sitting, walking, or lying down. {42}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas will know through their smells</p>
<p>The bodies of deva maidens beautified by many flowers,</p>
<p>Wherever they go, wherever they enjoy themselves,</p>
<p>Adorned and beautified by constantly worn garlands. {43}</p>
<p>“And they will also know through their aromas</p>
<p>The devas above, up to the summit of existence;</p>
<p>Brahmās and Mahābrahmās traveling in their airborne palaces;</p>
<p>And those resting in dhyāna and those who have arisen from it. {44}</p>
<p>“They will know the devas of Ābhāsvara,</p>
<p>Their deaths and rebirth, and those there for the first time.</p>
<p>That is what the sense of smell will be like</p>
<p>For bodhisattvas who possess this sūtra. {45}</p>
<p>“Those bodhisattvas will know every one</p>
<p>Of the bhikṣus who, whether walking or sitting,</p>
<p>Are dedicated to the Sugata’s teaching,</p>
<p>The bhikṣus who delight in reciting the scripture. {46}</p>
<p>“The wise ones will know by their aroma</p>
<p>All śrāvakas, the sons of the jinas—</p>
<p>Some of whom stay always at the foot of a tree—</p>
<p>Thinking, ‘That bhikṣu is in that place.’ {47}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas will know by their aromas</p>
<p>The bodhisattvas with mindfulness and dhyāna</p>
<p>Who are constantly reciting the scriptures</p>
<p>And teaching the Dharma in the assemblies. {48}</p>
<p>“They will know a lord of the world through his aroma:</p>
<p>A sugata, a great muni, who in whatever direction</p>
<p>Is teaching the Dharma with compassionate altruism</p>
<p>In the midst of a śrāvaka saṅgha that is looking at him. {49}</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas while in this world will know</p>
<p>Also all of the followers of a jina,</p>
<p>Those beings who listen to his Dharma,</p>
<p>And having heard it are overjoyed. {50}</p>
<p>“That is the power of smell that they will acquire,</p>
<p>But they still will not have the divine sense of smell.</p>
<p>They will have that which is the forerunner</p>
<p>Of the immaculate divine sense of smell. {51}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Satata­samitābhiyukta, the noble man or noble woman who possesses this Dharma teaching, teaches it, explains it, and has it written out will attain twelve hundred qualities of the sensory faculty of the tongue.</p>
<p>“With that sense of the tongue, whatever taste is experienced, whatever taste is perceived, and any taste with which the sensory organ of the tongue comes into contact, will all become an excellent divine taste. Any delightful taste that has not been experienced before will be experienced. Whatever taste is unpleasant will be transformed, when it comes in contact with the tongue, into a divine flavor.</p>
<p>“When they teach the Dharma in the midst of an assembly, they will bring pleasure to the senses of those beings. They will be satisfied, completely satisfied and overjoyed. The words they hear will be beautiful, delightful, and profound. They will touch the heart and be beloved. They will make those beings happy and they will rejoice.</p>
<p>“Whenever they teach the Dharma to anyone, the devas, hearing the beautiful, delightful sound, will come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. Male and female devas will wish to come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. Śakras, Brahmās, and Brahmakāyika devas will wish to come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. Male and female nāgas will wish to come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. Male and female garuḍas will wish to come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. Male and female kinnaras, male and female mahoragas, male and female yakṣas, and male and female piśācas will wish to come to them so as to see them, pay homage to them, honor them, and listen to the Dharma. They will revere them, venerate them, admire them, make offerings to them, praise them, and show them respect.</p>
<p>“They will also wish to see the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, and the upāsakas and upāsikās. They will wish to see the kings, the princes, and the king’s ministers. They will wish to see and to revere the bala­cakra­vartin king, the cakravartin who possesses the seven jewels, with his princes, his ministers, his harem, and his attendants.</p>
<p>“Those dharmabhāṇakas will teach the beautiful Dharma exactly as it was spoken by the Tathāgata. Brahmins, householders, and other people of the towns and the land will always, continuously be their followers, and attendants of the dharmabhāṇakas, until the end of their lives.</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata’s śrāvakas will also wish to see them. The pratyeka­buddhas will also wish to see them. The buddha bhagavāns will also wish to see them.</p>
<p>“Wherever that noble man or noble woman is, they will be teaching the Dharma in the presence of the Tathāgata. They will have become vessels for the Buddha’s Dharma. They will emit the profound, beautiful words of the Dharma.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“The faculty of their tongue will be excellent:</p>
<p>They will never experience an inferior taste,</p>
<p>For as soon as there is contact with it, food will become divine</p>
<p>And acquire a divine flavor. {52}</p>
<p>“They will speak with a voice that is gentle and pleasant,</p>
<p>Beautiful and pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>In the midst of the assembly they will always teach</p>
<p>With profound words that bring delight, {53}</p>
<p>“Whoever hears the Dharma that they teach,</p>
<p>By means of many quintillions of parables,</p>
<p>Will experience there the greatest joy</p>
<p>And make countless offerings. {54}</p>
<p>“Devas, nāgas, asuras, and guhyakas</p>
<p>Will wish to always look upon them</p>
<p>And they will listen to the Dharma with great reverence:</p>
<p>They will have all those qualities. {55}</p>
<p>“If they wish it, in this world realm</p>
<p>Everyone will hear their voice.</p>
<p>Their pleasant, sweet, profound,</p>
<p>And beautiful words will bring them joy. {56}</p>
<p>“The cakravartin sovereign kings</p>
<p>Will come before them to make offerings.</p>
<p>With their children and wives, hands together in homage,</p>
<p>They will constantly listen to the Dharma. {57}</p>
<p>“Crowds of yakṣas, nāgas, and gandharvas</p>
<p>Will constantly be honoring them.</p>
<p>Male and female piśācas will honor them,</p>
<p>Revere them, and make offerings to them. {58}</p>
<p>“Even Brahmā will be obedient to them.</p>
<p>Maheśvara, the deva Īśvara,</p>
<p>Śakra, and similarly other devas—</p>
<p>A multitude of devas will come to them. {59}</p>
<p>“The buddhas, the compassionate benefiters of the world,</p>
<p>And their śrāvakas will hear their voices,</p>
<p>Reveal their faces to them, protect them,</p>
<p>And be pleased with their teaching of the Dharma. {60}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Satata­samitābhiyukta, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possess this Dharma, read it, teach it, explain it, or write it out, will attain eight hundred qualities of the body. Their bodies will be purified. Their skin will be the pure color of beryl, and will bring happiness to those beings who see it.</p>
<p>“They will see the world realm of a thousand million worlds within their purified bodies. They will see in their bodies all the beings in the world realm of a thousand million worlds, whether they are dying or being born, good or bad, of a good color or a bad color, in the higher existences or the lower existences, dwelling on the Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla Mountains, on the kings of mountains, Meru or Sumeru, or who live as far down below as the Avīci hell or as high above as the summit of existence.</p>
<p>“They will see in their own bodies the bodies that have been attained by the śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, bodhisattvas, and tathāgatas who are present in the world realm of a thousand million worlds, and of those to whom the tathāgatas are teaching the Dharma, and the beings who are honoring those tathāgatas. Why is that? It is because their bodies will have become completely purified.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“The ones who possess this vast sūtra</p>
<p>Will have bodies that are completely purified,</p>
<p>As pure as if they were made of beryl</p>
<p>And will always bring joy to the beings who see them. {61}</p>
<p>“Just as a reflection appears in a clean mirror,</p>
<p>In that way they will see the worlds appear in their bodies.</p>
<p>They, the self-arisen ones, will see that and no other being;</p>
<p>That is what these purified bodies will be like. {62}</p>
<p>“They will see within their bodies the images of</p>
<p>Whatever beings there are in this world realm:</p>
<p>Humans, devas, asuras, and guhyakas,</p>
<p>Hell beings, pretas, and those born as animals. {63}</p>
<p>“In that way they will see in their bodies</p>
<p>All the airborne palaces of devas up to the summit of existence,</p>
<p>The mountains of rock, the Cakravāla mountains,</p>
<p>The Himalayas, Sumeru, and the great Meru. {64}</p>
<p>“In that way they will see the buddhas in their bodies,</p>
<p>With their śrāvakas and other offspring of the buddhas,</p>
<p>The bodhisattvas who are dwelling alone,</p>
<p>And those teaching the Dharma among crowds. {65}</p>
<p>“They will acquire that kind of pure body,</p>
<p>In which appears the entire world realm.</p>
<p>They will still not have acquired the divine body;</p>
<p>Such will be their natural body. {66}</p>
<p>“Moreover, Satata­samitābhiyukta, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possess this Dharma, read it, teach it, explain it, or write it out will attain twelve hundred qualities of mental activity, and their mental faculty will be purified. Those who have a purified mental faculty will understand many meanings from hearing just one verse. And, comprehending that, they will be able to teach it for a month, for four months, or for a year. They will never forget any Dharma that they have been taught. They will be able to apply to the Dharma all of the world’s languages, incantations, and mundane terminology. They will know all the movement and activity in the minds of all those beings born in the six classes of existence in the world realm of a thousand million worlds.</p>
<p>“Even though they will not yet have attained the wisdom of the āryas, they will still have acquired that kind of purified mental faculty. Whatever Dharma definition they have contemplated, they will teach, and they will teach all of that correctly. They will teach all that the Tathāgata has taught. They will teach all the Dharma teachings taught by the jinas of the past.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Their mental faculty will become pure,</p>
<p>Clear, bright, and unobscured.</p>
<p>They will know the many kinds of phenomena:</p>
<p>The good, the bad, and the neutral. {67}</p>
<p>“When the resolute ones hear one verse</p>
<p>They will know many meanings within it.</p>
<p>They will be able to teach that correctly and consistently,</p>
<p>Continually for four months or a year. {68}</p>
<p>“The devas, humans, asuras, and guhyakas,</p>
<p>The nāgas and those born as animals,</p>
<p>The beings dwelling in this world realm,</p>
<p>Whether they are outside or inside— {69}</p>
<p>“All those beings who dwell in the six existences—</p>
<p>Whatever kinds of thoughts they have,</p>
<p>The wise ones will know them all in one instant.</p>
<p>These are the benefits from possessing this sūtra. {70}</p>
<p>“The Dharma that is taught in all worlds by</p>
<p>The Buddha who has the signs of hundreds of merits,</p>
<p>They will hear even those completely pure words,</p>
<p>And they will remember everything that has been taught. {71}</p>
<p>“They will contemplate many supreme dharmas.</p>
<p>They will always teach many dharmas,</p>
<p>And they will never have any confusion.</p>
<p>These are the benefits from possessing this sūtra. {72}</p>
<p>“They will know the major and minor connections</p>
<p>And the differing qualities within all the dharmas.</p>
<p>They will know the meanings and the definitions,</p>
<p>And they will teach exactly what it is they know. {73}</p>
<p>“Without being timorous, in the center of the assembly</p>
<p>They will always give the teaching of the Dharma</p>
<p>That is the sūtra that has been taught in this world</p>
<p>For a long time by previous masters of the world. {74}</p>
<p>“Their mental faculty will become like that</p>
<p>Through possessing and reading this sūtra.</p>
<p>They will still not have attained unimpeded wisdom,</p>
<p>But this is what will presage it. {75}</p>
<p>“The holders of this sūtra of the Sugata</p>
<p>Will reach the level of an ācārya,</p>
<p>Teach the Dharma to all beings,</p>
<p>And be skilled in millions of definitions.” {76}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Benefits of the Purity of the Six Āyatanas,” the eighteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Sadāparibhūta</p>
<p>Chapter 19</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, “Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, you should know that this Dharma teaching is like this: Whoever rejects this Dharma teaching, and scolds, rebukes, and speaks crudely and harshly to the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who possess such a sūtra as this, will experience the undesirable result ripening from that, which is that they will be unable to speak words. Whoever possesses such a sūtra as this, reads it, studies it, teaches it, and teaches it extensively to others will have the desirable result ripening from that, which is, as I have said before, that they will attain purified eyes, nose, ears, tongue, body, and mind.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in the past, in a time gone by, countless, innumerable, incalculable, vast asaṃkhyeya eons ago, at that time, in that era, in the Vinirbhoga eon, in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā, there appeared in the world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja, in that world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā, taught the Dharma before the world with its devas, humans, and asuras in this way: To the śrāvakas he taught the Dharma conjoined with the four truths of the āryas, and nirvāṇa as the ultimate goal, as well as the process of dependent origination, in order that they might transcend birth, aging, sickness, death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and distress. To the bodhisattva mahāsattvas he taught the Dharma that commences with the highest, complete enlightenment conjoined with the six perfections, and concludes with omniscient wisdom.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja’s lifespan was a hundred thousand quintillion eons, as numerous as the grains of sand in four Ganges Rivers. After he passed into nirvāṇa, his Dharma remained for hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons, as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa. The outer form of his Dharma remained for hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons, as numerous as the atoms in four continents.</p>
<p>“Then, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, after both the Dharma and the outer form of the Dharma of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja, who had passed into nirvāṇa, had ceased to exist, another tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja appeared in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in that way, one after another, there appeared two million quintillion tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas named Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in the Vinirbhoga eon, in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā, when the bhagavān who was the first tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha, one with perfect wisdom and conduct, sugata, knower of the world, unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, teacher of gods and humans, buddha, bhagavān named Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja had passed into nirvāṇa, his Dharma had ceased to exist, and the outer form of his Dharma was coming to an end; his teachings were being trodden down by arrogant bhikṣus. Then there appeared a bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu named Sadāparibhūta.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, why was that bodhisattva mahāsattva named Sadāparibhūta?</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, whenever that bodhisattva mahāsattva saw a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī, an upāsaka or upasikā, he would come before them and say, ‘I do not ridicule you, brothers and sisters. You are not ridiculous. Why is that? It is because you have all been practicing bodhisattva conduct and you will all become tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.’</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in this way, whenever that bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu saw a being, even if he was far away, he would come before them and make that proclamation. He did not recite scripture or a daily recitation, but would come before a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī, an upāsaka or upasikā and say, ‘I do not ridicule you, brothers and sisters. You are not ridiculous. Why is that? It is because you have all been practicing bodhisattva conduct and you will all become tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.’</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, when that bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu made that proclamation before a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī, an upāsaka or upasikā, or anyone, most of them became angry, malicious, and disbelieving. They abused and scolded him, thinking, ‘Why does this bhikṣu, without our asking, say that he does not intend to ridicule us? And yet he does ridicule us, because he gives us a prophecy of our highest, complete enlightenment, without our having thought of it or wished for it.’</p>
<p>“Mahāsthāmaprāpta, that bodhisattva mahāsattva spent many years being scolded and abused in that way, but he never had any anger or malice toward anyone. When he made such a proclamation and they threw clods and and sticks at him, he would call to them with a loud voice from a distance, saying, ‘I do not ridicule you!’ Therefore the arrogant bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās to whom he constantly made his proclamations gave him the name Sadāparibhūta.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, when the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta was near death, when he was dying, he heard this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. The tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja had taught this Dharma teaching in twenty hundred thousand quintillion times a hundred thousand trillion verses. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta, when he was dying, when he was near death, heard from the air the words of this Dharma teaching. Without anyone speaking, he heard these words from the air. He remembered this Dharma teaching and attained pure eyes, a pure nose, pure ears, a pure tongue, a pure body, and a pure mind. As soon as he had attained those purities, he empowered his composite life to continue for a further twenty hundred thousand quintillion years and proclaimed widely this Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Those arrogant bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās to whom he had previously said, ‘I am not ridiculing you,’ and who gave him the name Sadāparibhūta, when they saw the might of the power of his miracles, the might of the power of his commitment, the might of the power of his eloquence, and the great might of the power of his wisdom, they became his followers in order to listen to the Dharma.</p>
<p>“He also taught many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of other beings, and they were all introduced to the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, that bodhisattva mahāsattva, having passed away from that life, then pleased twenty thousand million tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who were all named Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja, and in all those times he taught this Dharma teaching. Through that previous root of merit he eventually pleased twenty thousand million tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who were all named Meghasvararāja, and in all those times he possessed this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma and taught it to the fourfold assemblies. In all those times he possessed pure eyes. He also possessed a pure nose, pure ears, a pure tongue, a pure body, and a pure mind.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, that bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta revered, venerated, worshiped, made offerings to, praised, and showed respect to many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of tathāgatas. He revered, venerated, worshiped, made offerings to, and praised many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddhas. In all those times he possessed this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. Through the ripening of his previous root of merit, he attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, the one known by the fourfold assemblies as Sadāparibhūta at the time, on that occasion of the teaching of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja, pleased that number of tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas. If you doubt, are uncertain, are unsure, or are wondering if the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta was someone else, then, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, do not have such a view. Why not? Because at that time, on that occasion, I was the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, if I had not previously obtained and possessed this Dharma teaching I would not have quickly attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in this way.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, in that way I obtained this Dharma teaching directly from the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas of the past, and read it and taught it. That is why I quickly attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta proclaimed this Dharma teaching, which had been taught by the Bhagavān, to many hundreds of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās, saying, ‘I do not ridicule you. You have all been practicing bodhisattva conduct and you will all become tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas.’</p>
<p>“Those who felt malice toward that bodhisattva did not see a tathāgata, nor hear the word Dharma, nor hear the word saṅgha for twenty thousand million eons. They experienced the unendurable suffering of the great Avīci hell for ten thousand eons. When they were all freed from that obscuration of karma, that bodhisattva mahāsattva ripened them for the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, if you doubt, are uncertain, are unsure, or are wondering who at that time, on that occasion, were the beings who disparaged and censured that bodhisattva mahāsattva, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, they are the five hundred bodhisattvas such as Bhadrapāla, and the five hundred bhikṣuṇīs, such as Siṃhacandrā, and the five hundred upāsikās, such as Sugatacetanā, who are in this assembly, who are all irreversibly progressing to the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, there is that kind of great benefit from the aggregation of merit acquired by those who possess and teach this Dharma teaching. It causes the bodhisattva mahāsattvas to attain the highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Mahā­sthāma­prāpta, when I, the Tathāgata, have passed into nirvāṇa, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas should continuously possess this Dharma teaching, teach it, read it, and explain it.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“I remember a time in the past</p>
<p>When there appeared Bhīṣma­garjita­svara­rāja,</p>
<p>The guide of devas, humans, yakṣas, and rākṣasas.</p>
<p>Devas and humans made offerings to that great muni. {1}</p>
<p>“When that jina had passed into nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>In the final stage of the disarray of the Dharma</p>
<p>There appeared a bodhisattva bhikṣu,</p>
<p>And his name was Sadāparibhūta. {2}</p>
<p>“He came before other bhikṣus, and similarly</p>
<p>Those who believed in objective truth,</p>
<p>Saying, ‘I would never ridicule you.</p>
<p>You are practicing for the highest enlightenment.’ {3}</p>
<p>“He made this proclamation,</p>
<p>Always enduring abuse and condemnation.</p>
<p>When he was dying,</p>
<p>He heard this sūtra. {4}</p>
<p>“Then the wise one did not die at that time</p>
<p>And his life was empowered to be extremely long,</p>
<p>And within the teaching of that Guide,</p>
<p>In that time he taught this sūtra. {5}</p>
<p>“He even ripened for enlightenment</p>
<p>All those who had the view of objective truth.</p>
<p>Then, after that bodhisattva passed away,</p>
<p>He pleased thousands of millions of buddhas. {6}</p>
<p>“Through that merit he created</p>
<p>He always taught this sūtra, and finally</p>
<p>That bodhisattva attained enlightenment,</p>
<p>And he was me, Śākyamuni. {7}</p>
<p>“In that time the wise one proclaimed enlightenment</p>
<p>To the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas,</p>
<p>And upāsikās who were there at that time,</p>
<p>And who held the view of objective reality. {8}</p>
<p>“They saw many millions of buddhas;</p>
<p>Those who numbered no fewer than five hundred,</p>
<p>Are the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs,</p>
<p>and upāsakas present before me now. {9}</p>
<p>“They all heard from me the highest Dharma</p>
<p>And it was I who ripened them all.</p>
<p>When I am in nirvāṇa, all these heroes</p>
<p>Will be holders in this world of this highest sūtra. {10}</p>
<p>“For many millions of endless eons</p>
<p>This kind of Dharma will never be heard.</p>
<p>Even though billions of buddhas appear</p>
<p>This sūtra will not be taught by them. {11}</p>
<p>“Therefore, when you have heard this kind of</p>
<p>Dharma taught by a self-arisen one,</p>
<p>You should obtain it again and again,</p>
<p>And when I am in nirvāṇa teach this sūtra.” {12}</p>
<p>This concludes “Sadāparibhūta,” the nineteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Tathāgata’s Miracles</p>
<p>Chapter 20</p>
<p>Then those hundreds of millions of quintillions of bodhisattvas who had emerged from the ground, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm, placed their hands together in homage and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we will teach this Dharma teaching in all the buddha realms where the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, and in the buddha realms where the Bhagavān will pass into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, we will possess this vast Dharma teaching, and read it, teach it, explain it, and write it out.”</p>
<p>At this, many hundred thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas, such as Mañjuśrī, who dwelled in the world realm Sahā, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, nonhumans, and bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River, said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we shall teach this Dharma teaching. Bhagavān, without a body we will reside in the air and we will proclaim it with our voices. We will make beings who are without roots of merit create roots of merit.”</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra—the one who was foremost among the previously described multitudes, great multitudes, and masters of the multitudes of bodhisattva mahāsattvas—and said to the multitudes, great multitudes, and masters of the multitudes of bodhisattva mahāsattvas, “Excellent, Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra, excellent! Do so! The Tathāgata ripened you for the sake of this Dharma teaching.”</p>
<p>At that moment both the bhagavān, tathāgata Śākyamuni and the bhagavān who had passed into nirvāṇa, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who were seated on a lion throne inside the stūpa, smiled. From the mouths of both, the organs of their tongues emerged. Those tongues extended as far as the realm of Brahmā, and from both those tongues many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of light rays radiated. From those light rays, from each light ray, there emanated many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas whose bodies were the color of gold, who possessed the thirty-two signs of a great being, and were seated upon lion thrones in the center of lotuses. Those bodhisattvas went to hundreds of thousands of world realms in the main and intermediate directions. In those main and intermediate directions they taught the Dharma while remaining in midair.</p>
<p>Just as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna performed this miracle with their tongues, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas in other hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms, who were seated on their individual lion thrones at the foot of precious trees, also performed this miracle with their tongues.</p>
<p>The Bhagavān Śākyamuni, Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, and all those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas performed this miracle for a hundred thousand years. Then, after a hundred thousand years had passed, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas concluded their miracle, and simultaneously, in the same instant, the same moment, the same second, made the great sound of clearing their throats and the sound of snapping their fingers once. That great sound of clearing their throats and the great sound of their finger snaps shook all the hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms in the ten directions. They shook, shook strongly, shook intensely; shuddered, shuddered strongly, shuddered intensely; and quaked, quaked strongly, and quaked intensely. All the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans who were in those buddha realms, while remaining there, through the power of the buddhas saw this Sahā world realm. They saw the hundreds of thousands of quintillions of tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas seated on their individual lion thrones at the foot of precious trees, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna seated upon a lion throne in the center of the stūpa, and the fourfold assembly. Seeing them they were astonished, amazed, and overjoyed, and they heard these words that came from the air: “Oh friends, beyond countless, innumerable hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni is teaching to bodhisattva mahāsattvas the Dharma teaching, the extensive sūtra called The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, which is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all buddhas. You should, with a superior motivation, rejoice in this! Pay homage to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni! Make offerings to him!”</p>
<p>All those beings, having heard those words from the air, while remaining in their worlds now said, “We pay homage to the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni!” In order to make offerings to the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni and this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, they placed their hands together in homage and scattered in the direction of this Sahā world realm many flowers, incenses, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, monastic robes, parasols, banners, divine flags, and banners of victory. They also scattered jewelry, clothing, long necklaces, short necklaces, jewels, and many kinds of precious materials. All those flowers, incenses, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, robes, parasols, banners, divine flags, banners of victory, long necklaces, short necklaces, jewels, and precious materials came to this Sahā world realm. All those flowers, incenses, perfumes, garlands, ointments, powders, robes, parasols, banners, divine flags, banners of victory, long necklaces, short necklaces, jewels, and precious materials covered the all-inclusive Sahā world realm. At the same time they also covered those other hundred thousand quintillion world realms. In those hundred thousand world realms where those tathāgatas were present, the skies above them were each completely covered by a vast canopy of flowers.</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra and the other bodhisattva mahāsattvas, “Noble ones, the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas have inconceivable power. Noble ones, in order to bestow upon you this Dharma teaching, I could teach the many kinds of benefits through many aspects of the Dharma for many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons; but even if I were to teach these benefits, I would not have finished describing the many kinds of benefits of this Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, in brief, all the dharmas of the Buddha, all that is preeminent from the Buddha, all the great secrets of the Buddha, all the profundities of the Buddha, I teach within this Dharma teaching.</p>
<p>“Therefore, noble ones, after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa you should be in possession of this Dharma teaching. You should teach it, write it out, read it, explain it, meditate upon it, and make offerings to it.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, wherever this Dharma teaching is read, taught, explained, written out, contemplated, spoken about, chanted, or made into texts, whether it is a park, a temple, a palace, the foot of a tree, a house, or a cave, a caitya for the Tathāgata should be erected in that place. Why is that? It is because that place should be perceived as being the Bodhimaṇḍa of all the tathāgatas. It should be perceived as the place where all the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas attain the highest, complete enlightenment of complete buddhahood. It should be perceived as the place where all the tathāgatas turn the wheel of the Dharma, and the place where all the tathāgatas pass into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Those who are established in the wisdom of higher knowledge,</p>
<p>Those who have the inconceivable nature of benefiting the world,</p>
<p>Those who have infinite vision demonstrate miracles</p>
<p>For the sake of bringing joy to all beings. {1}</p>
<p>“Their tongues reach the realm of Brahmā</p>
<p>And they radiate thousands of light rays.</p>
<p>They demonstrate those amazing miracles</p>
<p>In order to lead beings to the highest enlightenment. {2}</p>
<p>“The buddhas make the sound of clearing their throats</p>
<p>And they make the sound of a single finger snap.</p>
<p>Those sounds are heard in all world realms,</p>
<p>As many worlds as there are in the ten directions. {3}</p>
<p>“Those compassionate and benefiting ones</p>
<p>Demonstrate those and other miracles, those qualities,</p>
<p>So that beings become overjoyed and in later times,</p>
<p>After the Sugata’s nirvāṇa, they will uphold this sūtra. {4}</p>
<p>“Though I were for many billions of eons</p>
<p>To praise those who are the offspring of the Sugata,</p>
<p>Who are upholders of this highest sūtra</p>
<p>When the Guide of the World has passed into nirvāṇa, {5}</p>
<p>“There would still be no end to their qualities,</p>
<p>Just as it is with directions and space.</p>
<p>Those who constantly uphold this sūtra</p>
<p>Have qualities beyond conception. {6}</p>
<p>“The one who sees me here and all these guides,</p>
<p>As well as this Guide of the World who has entered nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And sees all this multitude of bodhisattvas</p>
<p>And this fourfold assembly, {7}</p>
<p>“That is someone who on this day pleases me</p>
<p>And this lord of jinas who has entered nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>And he pleases all those other guides</p>
<p>Who are present in the ten directions. {8}</p>
<p>“The one who upholds this sūtra</p>
<p>Will see and make offerings</p>
<p>To the buddhas of the past, present, and future,</p>
<p>And all those in the ten directions. {9}</p>
<p>“Whoever upholds this true Dharma, this sūtra,</p>
<p>Will be contemplating the Bodhimaṇḍa.</p>
<p>They will know the great secret of the supreme beings</p>
<p>And they will soon be in meditation upon it. {10}</p>
<p>“Whoever is an upholder of this sūtra</p>
<p>Will have eloquence that is endless.</p>
<p>Just as the wind has no impediment</p>
<p>They will know the Dharma, meanings, and definitions. {11}</p>
<p>“They will always know the interconnection of the sūtras,</p>
<p>And the intention of the guides when they taught.</p>
<p>They will know the true meaning of the sūtras</p>
<p>Of the Guide who has passed into nirvāṇa. {12}</p>
<p>“They will bring radiance and light,</p>
<p>As do the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>They will travel on the earth, here and there,</p>
<p>And will establish many bodhisattvas. {13}</p>
<p>“Therefore, the wise bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who have heard these kinds of benefits</p>
<p>Should uphold this sūtra after my nirvāṇa</p>
<p>And there is no doubt that they will attain enlightenment.” {14}</p>
<p>This concludes “The Tathāgata’s Miracles,” the twentieth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Dhāraṇīs</p>
<p>Chapter 21</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja rose from his seat, removed his upper robe from one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and with his hands together in homage bowed toward the Bhagavān and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, how much merit will a noble man or noble woman generate by carrying this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma on their body or making a text of it?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān answered the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, “Bhaiṣajyarāja, if a noble man or noble woman were to honor, venerate, worship, and make offerings to hundreds of thousands of quintillions of tathāgatas, as numerous as the grains of sand in eighty Ganges River, what do you think, would that noble man or noble woman generate much merit as a result of that?”</p>
<p>“Much merit, Bhagavān,” he answered. “Much merit, Sugata.”</p>
<p>“Bhaiṣajyarāja,” the Bhagavān continued, “I declare to you, I proclaim to you, Bhaiṣajyarāja, that the noble man or noble woman who possesses just one verse, or one line from this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma and reads it, studies it, and assiduously practices it, that noble man or noble woman, Bhaiṣajyarāja, will have even greater merit as a result of that.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we give these dhāraṇī-mantra words to a noble man or noble woman who carries on their body or makes a text of this Dharma teaching and upholds it, so that they may be protected, guarded, and hidden:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:anye manye mane mamane citte carite śame śamayitā viśānte mukte muktatame same avisame samasame jaye kṣaye akṣaye akṣīṇe śānte śamite dhāraṇi āloka­bhāṣe pratyavekṣaṇi viviru abhyantaraniviṣṭe abhyantarapāriśuddhi utkule mutkule arḍe parḍe sukāṅkṣi asama­same buddha­vilokite dharma­parīkṣite saṃgha­nirghoṣaṇi nirghoṣaṇi bhayābhaya­śodhani mantre mantrākṣayate rutakauśalye akṣaye akṣayavanatāye vakkule valoḍa amanyanatāya.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, these dhāraṇī-mantra words have been taught by buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers. If anyone opposes that kind of dharmabhāṇaka, someone who upholds this sūtra, they will offend all those buddha bhagavāns.”</p>
<p>At this, the Bhagavān congratulated the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, saying, “Bhaiṣajyarāja, through your reciting these dhāraṇī-mantra words you have benefited many beings. It is excellent, Bhaiṣajyarāja, excellent that you protect, guard, and conceal through your compassion for beings.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Pradānaśūra said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I too shall provide the words of a dhāraṇī-mantra for this kind of dharmabhāṇaka. If someone is seeking an opportunity to harm this kind of dharmabhāṇaka, such as a yakṣa, a rākṣasa, a pūtana, a kṛtya, a kumbhāṇḍa, or a preta, through this they will not find an opportunity to do so.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Pradānaśūra then recited the words of the dhāraṇī-mantra:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:jvale mahājvale ukke mukke aḍe aḍāvati nṛtye nṛtyāvati iṭṭini viṭṭini ciṭṭini nṛtyani nṛtyāvati svāhā.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, these dhāraṇī-mantra words have been taught and rejoiced in by tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River. If anyone opposes that kind of dharmabhāṇaka, they will offend all those tathāgatas.”</p>
<p>Next, the mahārāja Vaiśravaṇa said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I also shall recite the words of a dhāraṇī-mantra in order to compassionately benefit, bring happiness to, guard, protect, and conceal this kind of dharmabhāṇaka:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:aṭṭe naṭṭe tanaṭṭe anate nāti kunaṭi svāhā.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, these dhāraṇī-mantra words will protect those dharmabhāṇakas for a hundred yojanas. It will protect those dharmabhāṇakas, the noble men or noble women who uphold such a sūtra, and will bring them good fortune.”</p>
<p>Now the mahārāja Virūḍhaka, leading a following of a hundred thousand quintillion kumbhāṇḍas, joined that assembly. He then rose from his seat, removed his upper robe from one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and with his hands together in homage bowed toward the Bhagavān and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I too will recite the words of a dhāraṇī-mantra for the guarding, protection, and concealment of that kind of dharmabhāṇaka who upholds a sūtra such as this:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:agaṇe gaṇe gauri gāndhāri cāṇḍāli mātaṅgi pukkasi saṃkule vrūśali svāhā.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, these dhāraṇī-mantra words have been taught by four hundred and twenty million buddhas. If anyone opposes that kind of dharmabhāṇaka, they will offend all those tathāgatas.”</p>
<p>Then the rākṣasī named Lambā, the rākṣasī named Vilambā, the rākṣasī named Kūṭadantī, the rākṣasī named Puṣpadantī, the rākṣasī named Makuṭadantī, the rākṣasī named Keśinī, the rākṣasī named Acalā, the rākṣasī named Mālādhārī, the rākṣasī named Kuntī, the rākṣasī named Sarva­sattvojohārī, and the rākṣasī named Hārītī, with her children and servants—all those rākṣasīs came to where the Bhagavān was, and having arrived they all said in one voice to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we too will guard, protect, and conceal that kind of dharmabhāṇaka who upholds a sūtra such as this, so that if someone is seeking an opportunity to harm those dharmabhāṇakas they will not find an opportunity to do so.”</p>
<p>Then those rākṣasīs in one voice, with the same words, offered these dhāraṇī-mantra words to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:itime itime itime itime itime nime nime nime nime nime ruhe ruhe ruhe ruhe ruhe stuhe stuhe stuhe stuhe stuhe svāhā.</p>
<p>“If this is placed upon the head, there is no one who will be able to injure the dharmabhāṇakas. A yakṣa, rākṣasa, preta, piśāca, pūtana, kṛtya, vetāla, kumbhāṇḍa, stabdha, ostāraka, or apasmāraka; a kṛtya that is a yakṣa, a kṛtya that is nonhuman, or a kṛtya that is a human; those that cause illness for a day, for two days, for three days, for four days, or permanently; and those who appear in dreams in the form of a woman, the form of a man, or the form of a boy, or the form of a girl so as to cause harm, will not be able to do so.”</p>
<p>Then those rākṣasīs in one voice, with the same words, recited these verses to the Bhagavān:</p>
<p>“If someone attacks a dharmabhāṇaka</p>
<p>And they hear this mantra</p>
<p>Their head will burst into seven pieces</p>
<p>Like the foliage of a basil plant. {1}</p>
<p>“Those who attack the dharmabhāṇaka,</p>
<p>The way that they are following</p>
<p>Is the way of those who kill their mothers;</p>
<p>It is the way of those who kill their fathers. {2}</p>
<p>“Those who attack the dharmabhāṇaka,</p>
<p>The way that they are following</p>
<p>Is the way of the crushers of sesame;</p>
<p>It is the way of those with the sesame pestle. {3}</p>
<p>“Those who attack the dharmabhāṇaka,</p>
<p>The way that they are following</p>
<p>Is the way of those who are fraudulent in weights,</p>
<p>The way of those who are fraudulent in measures.” {4}</p>
<p>Kuntī and the other rākṣasīs said to the Bhagavān, “In this way we will protect the dharmabhāṇakas. We will bring them good fortune, prevent punishments, and counter poisons.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the rākṣasīs, “Excellent, O rākṣasīs, excellent! Protect, guard, and conceal those dharmabhāṇakas! You, Kuntī, and your followers should protect even those who only possess the name of this Dharma teaching, let alone those who have learned the entirety of this Dharma teaching, have made texts of it, have honored them, and offered to those texts flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, divine flags, lamps of sesame oil, lamps of ghee, lamps of perfumed oil, lamps of magnolia oil, lamps of gardenia oil, lamps of blue lotus oil, and lamps of royal jasmine oil, honoring them with hundreds of thousands of many kinds of offering such as those. You, Kuntī, and your followers should protect them!”</p>
<p>This concludes “Dhāraṇīs,” the twenty-first chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja</p>
<p>Chapter 22</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, through what cause is the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja active in this Sahā world realm? Bhagavān, he must have undergone many hundred thousands of quintillions of hardships. I request the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha to speak of just a fraction of what the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja has practiced, so that those who have heard the Bhagavān—the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, and the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have arrived here from other world realms and these great śrāvakas—will all be pleased, delighted, and happy.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān, knowing the request made by the bodhisattva mahāsattva Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, then said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, “Noble one, in the past, in a time gone by, as many eons ago as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, at that time there appeared in the world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the tathāgata, the arhat , perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī had a great following of eighty million bodhisattvas. He had a following of as many śrāvakas as there are grains of sand in seventy-two Ganges Rivers. In the time of his teaching there were no women, there were no beings in hell, there were no births as animals, there were no pretas, and no asuras. His buddha realm was delightful, as flat as the palm of a hand, its ground made of divine beryl, which was adorned by precious sandalwood trees. It was beautified by nets of jewels, hung with silk streamers, and perfumed by incense from precious censers. At an arrow-shot distance from the foot of all the precious trees there were precious high platforms. Upon each of those precious high platforms there were billions of devas playing musical instruments and cymbals, and singing songs in order to make offerings to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī.</p>
<p>“The Bhagavān taught those śrāvakas and bodhisattva mahāsattvas extensively this Dharma teaching, The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, commencing with the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī’s lifespan was forty-two thousand eons. The lifespans of those bodhisattva mahāsattvas and those śrāvakas were the same. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana was dedicated to hardship in following the teaching of that Bhagavān. For twelve thousand years he progressed with great diligence in his practice. After twelve thousand years had passed he attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms. As soon as he attained that samādhi, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana was pleased and delighted, joyous and happy.</p>
<p>“At that time, he thought, ‘I have attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms through this Dharma teaching, The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.’ Also at that time, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana thought, ‘In this way, I shall make an offering to the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī and to this Dharma teaching, The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.’</p>
<p>“He then entered that samādhi, and as soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana entered that samādhi, at that moment, there fell from the sky above a great rain of divine coral tree flowers and great coral tree flowers. Clouds of benzoin resin and sandalwood formed, and there fell a great rain of uragasāra sandalwood.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, this entire Sahā world realm would not be enough for the price of two karṣa of that kind of perfume.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana mindfully and knowingly arose from that samādhi. After arising from that samādhi, he thought, ‘This manifestation of miraculous events cannot serve as an offering to the Bhagavān in the way that giving my own body would be.’</p>
<p>“Then at that time, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana ate agarwood, frankincense, and mastic resin, and drank magnolia oil.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in this way the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana continually ate incenses and drank magnolia oil for twelve years.</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, after twelve years had passed, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana wrapped his body in divine cotton and soaked it with sesame oil, and, having made his firm resolve, he burned his own body as an offering to the Tathāgata and to this Dharma teaching, The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the light from the burning body of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana shone throughout as many world realms as there are grains of sand in eighty Ganges Rivers. The buddha bhagavāns, as numerous as the grains of sand in eighty Ganges Rivers, who were in those world realms exclaimed, ‘Excellent, noble one! Excellent! This is the true application of the diligence of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas. This is the true offering to a tathāgata and to the Dharma. The offering of flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols, banners, and divine flags, and the offering of other material gifts, and the offering of uragasāra sandalwood does not compare. Noble one, this is the supreme gift. Giving away one’s kingdom does not compare. Giving away one’s beloved children and spouses does not compare. Noble one, this Dharma offering of giving away your own body is the preeminent, the highest offering—the best, the most excellent offering.’</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, those buddha bhagavāns spoke those words and then were silent.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana’s body burned without going out for twelve years. Afterward, when twelve years had passed, the fire went out.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana made that kind of offering to the Tathāgata and to the Dharma. Then after he had died, during the time of the teaching of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī, he was reborn into the family of King Vimaladatta. He was miraculously born sitting cross-legged on his mother’s lap. As soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana was born, at that time he recited this verse to his parents:</p>
<p>“ ‘Supreme King, I have practiced in this world,</p>
<p>And living here I attained samādhi.</p>
<p>I had resolute diligence and great discipline</p>
<p>And I gave away my cherished body.’ {1}</p>
<p>“After the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana had recited that verse, he said to his parents, ‘Father and Mother, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī is now alive, present, and continues to remain in this world. He is the Bhagavān to whom I made this offering and attained the power of retention that is skill in all words. He is the Bhagavān from whom I heard this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma taught in eighty times a hundred thousand quintillion verses, a thousand trillion verses, a hundred thousand trillion verses, and ten quintillion verses. Therefore, Father, Mother, it would be excellent for me to go before the Bhagavān. Then when I am there I will make offerings to the Bhagavān.’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, at that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana rose into the air to the height of seven palm trees and, sitting cross-legged in a kūṭāgāra made of the seven precious materials, he went into the presence of the Bhagavān. Having arrived there he bowed his head to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān seven times, and with his hands together in homage he bowed toward the Bhagavān and, paying homage to the Bhagavān, he praised him by reciting this verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Hero, Lord of Humans, with a stainless face,</p>
<p>Your light rays beautify the ten directions in this world.</p>
<p>Sugata, I have made the supreme offering to you,</p>
<p>And, Lord, I have come here so that I might see you.’ {2}</p>
<p>“Then he said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī, ‘Bhagavān, will you continue to remain?’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­­sattv­a­priy­a­darśana, ‘Noble one, the time for me to pass into nirvāṇa has come. Noble one, the time when my life is to end has come. Noble one, go and prepare my dais, for I will pass into nirvāṇa.’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­­darśana, ‘Noble one, I entrust this teaching to you. I entrust to you these bodhisattva mahāsattvas, these great śrāvakas, this enlightenment of buddhahood, this world realm, these precious platforms, these precious trees, and these devas who are honoring me. Noble one, I also entrust to you whatever relics there will be from my passing into nirvāṇa. Noble one, make vast offerings to my relics, distribute my relics widely, and construct many thousands of stūpas.’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī having thus instructed the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana, in the last division of that night he passed into nirvāṇa, into the realm of nirvāṇa that has no remainder.</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, when the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana saw that the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī had passed into nirvāṇa, he made a heap of uragasāra sandalwood and cremated the body of the Tathāgata. When he saw that the cremation fire of the Tathāgata had gone out, he collected the relics, weeping, wailing, and lamenting.</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana, weeping, wailing, and lamenting, had eighty-four thousand vases made of the seven precious materials, and he placed the relics of the Tathāgata inside them. He had eighty-four thousand stūpas constructed that were also made of the seven precious materials and were so high they reached the realm of Brahmā. They were adorned by a tier of parasols and were hung with streamers and bells. Having had these stūpas constructed he thought, ‘I have made an offering to the relics of Bhagavān Candra­sūrya­vimala­prabhāsa­śrī, of the Tathāgata, but I shall make a far greater and higher offering than that to the relics of the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana said to the all-inclusive assembly of bodhisattvas, and the assembly of the great śrāvakas, and the devas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, ‘Noble ones, think of making offerings to the relics of the Bhagavān!’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, at that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana, in front of the eighty-four thousand stūpas, burned his arm that was adorned by a hundred merits. Burning his arm, he made an offering to those stūpas of the Tathāgata for seventy-two thousand years. Through making that offering, he guided countless hundred thousands of quintillions of śrāvakas. Also all the bodhisattvas attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms.</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the all-inclusive assembly of bodhisattvas, and the great śrāvakas, seeing that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana had lost a limb, wept, wailed, lamented, and cried out to each other, ‘Our master and teacher, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana, does not now have all his limbs; he has lost an arm!’</p>
<p>“Then, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana said to those bodhisattva mahāsattvas, great śrāvakas, and devas, ‘Noble ones, do not weep on seeing that I have lost a limb. Do not wail! Do not lament! Noble ones, I take as my witness all the buddha bhagavāns that live, are present, and remain in the endless infinite world realms in the ten directions, and before them I make this resolution of the truth. Through the truth, through true words, through having given up my arm as an offering to the Tathāgata, may my body become golden. Through the truth, the true words of that, may my arm be restored as it was before. May this great earth shake six times, and may a great rain of flowers be cast down by the devas who dwell in the sky.’</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, as soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana had made that resolution of the truth, the world realm of a thousand million worlds shook in six ways, a rain of flowers fell from the sky, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana’s arm was restored as it was before, which was due to the bodhisattva mahāsattva’s having gained the power of wisdom and having gained the power of merit.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, are you uncertain, unsure, undecided, thinking that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana at that time, on that occasion, was anyone else? Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, do not have that view. Why is that? Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, this bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja was at that time, on that occasion, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja accomplished those hundred thousand quintillion hardships, and he gave up his body.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the noble man or noble woman who enters the Bodhisattva­yāna, through wishing for this highest, complete enlightenment, should burn the big toe of a foot for the caityas of the Tathāgata—they should burn a finger or a toe or a limb or an arm. That noble man or noble woman who has entered the Bodhisattva­yāna will thus create a much greater amount of merit. Giving up a kingdom is not comparable. Giving up a beloved spouse, son, or daughter is not comparable. Giving up a world realm of a billion worlds with its forests, oceans, mountains, rivers, lakes, ponds, wells, and parks is not comparable.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, if a noble man or noble woman who has entered the Bodhisattva­yāna were to give this world realm of a billion worlds filled with the seven precious materials to all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, that noble man or noble woman would not create as much merit as that created by the noble man or noble woman who possesses just one four-line verse from this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. It is taught that their merit would be much greater. Giving this world realm of a billion worlds filled with the seven precious materials to all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and pratyeka­buddhas is not comparable.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the ocean is supreme over all rivers, lakes, and ponds.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over all the sūtras taught by all the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that Sumeru, the king of mountains, is supreme over the Kāla, Cakravāla, and Mahācakravāla mountains.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over all the sūtras taught by all the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the moon is supreme in brightness over the stars.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, the bright light of this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over that of a hundred thousand quintillion moons.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the disk of the sun eliminates all darkness.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma eliminates all the darkness of bad actions.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that Śakra is the lord of devas among the devas of Trāyastriṃśa.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is the lord of all the sūtras taught by the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that Brahmā, lord of Sahā, is the king over all the Brahmakāyika devas and acts as their father in the Brahmā paradise.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is the father of all beings, both those in training and those who have transcended training, and all who have entered the Śrāvakayāna, Pratyeka­buddha­yāna, or Bodhisattva­yāna.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the stream entrants, the once-returners, the nonreturners, the arhats, and pratyeka­buddhas have transcended all ordinary, foolish beings.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma has transcended all the other sūtras taught by the tathāgatas, is superior to them, and is supreme among them.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, know that those who possess this king of the sūtras are supreme among all beings.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the bodhisattva is supreme over all the śrāvakas and pratyeka­buddhas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in that same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is supreme over all the sūtras taught by the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, it is like the way that the Tathāgata is crowned King of the Dharma among all the śrāvakas, pratyeka­buddhas, and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in the same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is like the Tathāgata for all those who have entered the Bodhisattva­yāna.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma protects beings from all fear, and frees them from all suffering. It is like a pond for those who are thirsty. It is like clothing for the naked. It is like a caravan leader for merchants. It is like a mother for children. It is like a boat for those crossing to the opposite shore. It is like medicine for the sick. It is like a lamp for those in the obscuration of darkness. It is like jewels for those wishing for wealth. It is like a cakravartin for all minor kings. It is like the ocean for rivers. It is like a torch for dispelling all darkness.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in the same way, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma frees from all suffering. It ends all illness. It frees from all the distress of the bondage of saṃsāra.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, for the person who hears this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, writes it down, or has someone write it, and who, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, possesses this Dharma teaching, or teaches it, hears it, writes it down or has someone write it, makes a volume of it, honors it, venerates it, worships it, and makes offerings to it—makes many kinds of offerings to it, such as flowers, incense, perfume, garlands, ointments, powders, cloth, parasols, banners, flags, music, clothing, the act of placing hands together in homage, lamps of ghee, lamps of sesame oil, lamps of perfumed sesame oil, lamps of magnolia oil, and lamps of royal jasmine, bignonia, gardenia, and shrubby jasmine oils—even the wisdom of the buddhas is unable to know the limits of the merit created by such honoring, venerating, worshiping, and offering.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, the noble man or noble woman who has entered the Bodhisattva­yāna and possesses this chapter, ‘The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja,’ teaches it, or listens to it will generate much merit. If a woman hears and possesses this Dharma teaching, that will be her last life as a woman.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, a woman who, in the final five hundred years, hears and practices this chapter, ‘The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja,’ when she dies will be reborn in the world realm Sukhāvatī. There he will be born upon a lion throne in the center of a lotus where the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Amitāyus, encircled by an assembly of bodhisattvas, lives, is present, and remains. There he will not be afflicted by desire, anger, ignorance, pride, envy, rage, or malice. As soon as he is born there he will possess the five higher knowledges. He will also attain receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, that bodhisattva mahāsattva, having attained receptivity to the birthlessness of phenomena, will see tathāgatas as numerous as the grains of sand in seventy-two Ganges Rivers. With his purified eyes he will see those buddha bhagavāns. In that way the faculty of his eyes will be purified. Also those buddha bhagavāns will congratulate him, saying, ‘Noble one, it is excellent that you have heard this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, and had bestowed upon you, recited, meditated on, and contemplated the words of Buddha Śākyamuni. Noble one, the merit you have created cannot be burned by fire or swept away by water. Noble one, the merit you have created cannot be described even by a hundred thousand buddhas. Noble one, you have defeated the opposing forces of the māras, you have crossed the ocean of existence, you have crushed the assault of the enemy. You have been empowered by a hundred thousand buddhas. Noble one, there is no one like you in the world with its devas. Other than the Tathāgata, no śrāvaka, pratyeka­buddha, or bodhisattva can outshine your merit, knowledge, wisdom, or samādhi.’</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, that bodhisattva mahāsattva will attain that kind of development of knowledge.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, if someone hears the teaching of this chapter, ‘The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja,’ and says, ‘It is excellent! Excellent!’ the scent of the blue lotus will come from their mouth, and their body will have the aroma of sandalwood. One who, when this Dharma teaching is being taught, says, ‘This is excellent!’ gains these kinds of evident qualities that I have taught.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, I entrust you with this chapter on the history of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarva­sattva­priya­darśana so that in the future, in the later times, during the final five hundred years, it will be practiced in Jambudvīpa and will not vanish; so that Māra, the evil one, will find no opportunity to attack it; and so that the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and mahoragas who belong to the class of māras will find no opportunity to attack it.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, this Dharma teaching is blessed to be like medicine for those beings in Jambudvīpa who are sick, who are afflicted by illness. When one has heard this Dharma teaching, the body will not be afflicted by illness, and there will no aging or premature death.</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, if someone who has entered the Bodhisattva­yāna sees a bhikṣu who possesses this sūtra, they should sprinkle him with sandalwood powder and with blue lotuses. And having scattered those, they should have the thought, ‘This noble man is going to the Bodhimaṇḍa, he will obtain grass, he will lay out the grass at the Bodhimaṇḍa, he will defeat the māras, he will blow the conch of the Dharma, he will beat the drum of the Dharma, and he will cross the ocean of saṃsāra.’</p>
<p>“Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, a noble man or noble woman who has entered the Bodhisattva­yāna should develop that thought when they see a bhikṣu who possesses this kind of sūtra. In that way there will be those qualities that are the qualities that have been described by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>When the chapter “The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja” was taught, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas attained the power of retention that possesses skill in words.</p>
<p>The bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna also commended Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, saying, “It is excellent, excellent that you have asked the Tathāgata about the Dharma that has inconceivable qualities.”</p>
<p>This concludes “The Past of Bhaiṣajyarāja,” the twenty-second chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Gadgadasvara</p>
<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Then at that time the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni emitted light from the ūrṇā hair between his eyebrows, which was a sign of a great being. That light shone throughout hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms in the east, which were as numerous as the grains of sand in eighteen Ganges Rivers. Beyond those hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha realms, which were as numerous as the grains of sand in eighteen Ganges Rivers, there was the world realm named Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā, in which there lived, was present, and remained the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha named Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña. He was accompanied and revered by an immeasurably great saṅgha of bodhisattvas. Then the ray of light emitted by the bhagavān tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni from his ūrṇā hair shone at that time throughout the world realm Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā.</p>
<p>In that Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā world realm there was the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, who had through his past roots of merit seen such light rays from many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara had attained many samādhis: the samādhi of the crest adornment of the victory banner, the samādhi of the white lotus of the good Dharma, the samādhi of the stainless gift, the samādhi of the play of the king of stars, the samādhi like-the-wind, the samādhi of the seal of knowledge, the samādhi of the lamp of the moon, the samādhi of skill in all sounds, the samādhi of the accumulation of all merit, the samādhi of possessing faith, the samādhi of the display of miraculous powers, the samādhi of the torch of knowledge, the samādhi of the king of arrays, the samādhi of stainless light, the samādhi of stainless essence, the samādhi of completion through water, the samādhi of the disk of the sun, and so on, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara having attained hundreds of thousands of quintillions of samādhis, as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River.</p>
<p>The light struck the body of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, and then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, “Bhagavān, I am going to the Sahā world realm in order to see, pay homage to, and honor the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni, and to see the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, to see the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, to see the bodhisattva Pradānaśūra, to see the bodhisattva Nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, to see the bodhisattva Vi­śiṣṭa­cāritra, to see the bodhisattva Vyūharāja, and to see the bodhisattva Bhaiṣajya­samudgata.”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, “Noble one, when you go to the world realm Sahā and have arrived there, do not perceive it as inferior. Noble one, the world realm Sahā is uphill and downhill, made of earth, crowded with dark mountains, and filled with cesspools. The bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni has a short body; the bodhisattva mahāsattvas have short bodies also. Noble one, the body you have gained is forty-two thousand yojanas high. Noble one, my body is sixty-eight hundred thousand yojanas high. Noble one, you are handsome, attractive, with an excellent body that has an excellent color and is perfectly developed. You have exceptional splendor from a hundred thousand merits. Therefore, noble one, when you go to the Sahā world realm, do not perceive that tathāgata, those bodhisattvas, or that buddha realm as inferior.”</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, “Bhagavān, I go to the Sahā world realm through the Tathāgata’s blessing, through the Tathāgata’s development of power, the Tathāgata’s display, the Tathāgata’s arrays, and the Tathāgata’s superior wisdom.”</p>
<p>Then at that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, without departing from that buddha realm, without rising up from his seat, entered samādhi in this way. As soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara entered samādhi, at that moment, in front of the Dharma seat of the Tathāgata on Vulture Peak in the Sahā world realm there appeared eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion lotuses with gold stems, silver petals, and pericarps the color of flame of the forest flowers.</p>
<p>When Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta saw that array of lotuses he asked the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni, “Bhagavān, of whose coming are these eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion lotuses with gold stems, silver petals, and pericarps the color of flame of the forest flowers an omen?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān answered Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, these are an omen that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, accompanied by a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas, will come to this Sahā world realm from the east from the world realm Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā, which is the buddha realm of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, in order to see me, to pay homage to me, to honor me, and to listen to this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what accumulation of good karma has that noble one created such that through that creation of an accumulation of good karma he has attained this excellence? Bhagavān, what samādhi has that bodhisattva practiced? Bhagavān, we should listen to what that samādhi is. Bhagavān, we should practice that samādhi. What is that bodhisattva mahāsattva like? What is his color? What is his form? What kind of characteristics does he have? What kind of shape does he have? What kind of practice does he have? We should see what this bodhisattva is like. Bhagavān, what cause will inspire this bodhisattva mahāsattva to come to the Sahā world realm? I request that the Tathāgata create that cause.”</p>
<p>Then at that time the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni requested of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa, “Bhagavān, create a cause to inspire the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara to come to this Sahā world realm.”</p>
<p>Then at that time the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna created this cause to invoke the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara: “Come, noble one, to this Sahā world realm! This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta will delight in seeing you!”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara bowed his head to the feet of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, circumambulated him three times and, leading a retinue of a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas, they all at the same time vanished from the Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā world realm and came to this Sahā world realm. The worlds shook. A rain of lotuses fell. A hundred thousand quintillion musical instruments played. Gadgadasvara arrived in the sky at the height of seven palm trees, leading a retinue of bodhisattvas, residing in a kūṭāgāra made of the seven precious materials, with eyes that were like the petals of a blue lotus; with a face that was superior to a hundred thousand quintillion moons; with a body the color of gold; with a body adorned by a hundred thousand merits, shining with splendor, with an exceptional brilliance; with a body adorned by the signs of a superior being; and with a body as indestructible as Nārāyaṇa’s.</p>
<p>He came to where Vulture Peak is in the Sahā world realm, and having arrived he descended from the kūṭāgāra and, holding a string of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coins, he approached the Bhagavān and bowed his head down to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated him seven times, and gave the string of pearls to the Bhagavān as an offering.</p>
<p>When Gadgadasvara had given the string of pearls to the Bhagavān he said to him, “Bhagavān, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña asks after your welfare, saying, ‘Are you free from harm, free from distress, and in good health? Do you remain strong and happy?’ The bhagavān asks, ‘Bhagavān, do you have that which you must be patient with? That you have to wait for? Are your elements in harmony? Are the beings who follow you able to understand easily? Are they easy to guide? Are they easy to nurture? Do they wish for purity? Do they avoid the conduct of very strong desire? Do they avoid the conduct of very strong anger? Do they avoid the conduct of very strong ignorance? Bhagavān, are your beings without strong envy? Are they without greed? Do they have no disrespect for their mothers? Do they have no disrespect for their fathers? Do they have no disrespect for bhikṣus? Do they have no disrespect for brahmins? Do they have no wrong views? Do they not have untamed minds? Do they not have uncontrolled senses? Bhagavān, have your beings banished the adversary who is Māra? Has the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who has passed into nirvāṇa, and who resides in a stūpa made of the seven precious materials, come to the Sahā world realm in order to listen to the Dharma?’</p>
<p>“The bhagavān also asked the bhagavān, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, ‘Bhagavān, Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, do you have that which you must be patient with? That you have to wait for? Bhagavān Tathāgata Prabhūtaratna, are you going to remain long? We also wish to see the body that is the relic of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, and therefore may the Tathāgata reveal well the body that is the relic of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna.’ ”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who had passed into nirvāṇa, “Bhagavān, this bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has come wishing to see the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, who has passed into nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, “Noble one, it is excellent that you have come because you wish to see the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and myself, to listen to The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, and to see Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what kind of roots of merit has the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara created in the past, and in the presence of which tathāgata?”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī, “Noble one, in the past, in a time gone by, in an eon called Priyadarśa, in the world realm Sarva­rūpa­saṃdarśanā, there appeared in the world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja.</p>
<p>“Noble one, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara, for eighty-four thousand years, made an offering with a hundred thousand musical instruments to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja, and gave him eighty-four thousand bowls made of the seven precious materials.</p>
<p>“Noble one, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara attained that kind of faith in the teaching of Tathāgata Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja. If you are you uncertain, unsure, or undecided, thinking that it was someone else who at that time, on that occasion, made an offering to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja, and gave him those eighty-four thousand bowls, noble one, do not have such a view. Why is that? Noble one, the one who made the offering to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Megha­dundubhi­svara­rāja, and gave him those eighty-four thousand bowls, was this bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara.</p>
<p>“Noble one, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara honored many buddhas, generated roots of merit, and trained under many hundreds of thousands of buddhas. This bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has seen as many buddha bhagavāns in the past as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River.</p>
<p>“Padmaśrī, do you see the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara?”</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, I see him,” replied Padmaśrī. “Sugata, I see him.”</p>
<p>“Padmaśrī,” said the Bhagavān, “this bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in many forms: He teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma sometimes in the form of Brahmā, sometimes in the form of Śakra, sometimes in the form of Īśvara, sometimes in the form of Maheśvara, sometimes in the form of a general, sometimes in the form of Vaiśravaṇa, sometimes in the form of a cakravartin, sometimes in the form of a king of a region, sometimes in the form of a head merchant, sometimes in the form of a householder, sometimes in the form of a townsman, and sometimes in the form of a brahmin.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara teaches beings this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma sometimes in the form of a bhikṣu, sometimes in the form of a bhikṣuṇī, sometimes in the form of an upāsaka, sometimes in the form of an upāsikā, sometimes in the form of the wife of a head merchant, sometimes in the form of the wife of a householder, sometimes in the form of the wife of a townsman, sometimes in the form of a boy, and sometimes in the form of a girl.</p>
<p>“Noble one, through teaching in these numerous forms, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara teaches beings this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to beings, teaching some in the form of an asura, some in the form of a garuḍa, some in the form of a kinnara, and to some in the form of a mahoraga.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara is even the protector of beings in the unfortunate existences of the hells, rebirths as animals, and the realm of Yama.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara even teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to the beings in the royal harems by manifesting in the form of a woman.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gagdadasvara teaches the Dharma to beings in this Sahā world realm by teaching this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“Padmaśrī, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara is a protector of the beings who have been born into the Sahā world realm. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has emanated in such numerous forms in this Sahā world realm and taught beings this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“The miraculous powers of this excellent being do not decline. His wisdom does not decline. Noble one, the lights of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara’s wisdom illuminate this Sahā world realm. And in other world realms as numerous as the sand grains in the Ganges River, he has taught the Dharma in the form of a bodhisattva for the beings who are to be guided by a bodhisattva. He has taught the Dharma as a śrāvaka for the beings who are to be guided by a śrāvaka. He has taught the Dharma as a pratyeka­buddha for the beings who are to be guided by a pratyeka­buddha. He has taught the Dharma as a tathāgata for the beings who are to be guided by a tathāgata. And so on up to manifesting the relics of a tathāgata for beings who are to be guided by the relics of a tathāgata. And so on up to passing into nirvāṇa for beings who are to be guided by his passing into nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Padmaśrī, in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has attained the development of the power of wisdom.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, what samādhi does the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara remain in for this creation of roots of merit? What is the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara’s samādhi for guiding this many beings?”</p>
<p>The bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī, “Noble one, the samādhi that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara remains in so as to benefit in that way countless beings is this samādhi called manifestation of all forms.”</p>
<p>When this “Gadgadasvara” chapter was taught, the eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas who had come with the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara into this Sahā world realm all attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms. Also, the countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas who dwelled in this Sahā world realm attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms.</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara made vast, extensive offerings to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and to the stūpa of the relics of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna. Then he entered his kūṭāgāra made of the seven precious materials. The realm shook, a rain of lotuses fell, and there was the music of a hundred thousand quintillion musical instruments. Leading his retinue of a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas, they returned together to their own buddha realm.</p>
<p>When they had arrived there, he said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamala­dala­vimala­nakṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña, “Bhagavān, I have benefited beings in the Sahā world realm. I also saw the stūpa of the relics of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, and paid homage to it. I also saw and paid homage to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni. I also saw Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta. I also saw the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja, who has attained the might of the power of diligence, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Pradānaśūra. All those eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas attained the samādhi called manifestation of all forms.”</p>
<p>When the chapter of the coming and going of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara was being taught, forty-two thousand bodhisattvas attained receptivity to the nonarising of phenomena, and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī attained the white lotus of the good Dharma samādhi.</p>
<p>This concludes “Gadgadasvara,” the twenty-third chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Facing Everywhere: The Teaching of the Miracles of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati rose from his seat, removed his upper robe from one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and with his hands together in homage bowed toward the Bhagavān and asked the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, why is the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati, “Noble one, if the hundred thousand quintillion beings in this world who are experiencing suffering were to hear the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they would all become freed from that mass of suffering.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if those who possess the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara were to fall into a great mass of flames, they would all, through the splendor of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, be freed from that burning great mass of flames.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if they call out to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara when they are swept away by rivers, those rivers will bring them to shallow waters.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if a hundred thousand quintillion beings were to set out to sea in a ship, sailing to find cowries, gold, jewels, pearls, beryl, conch, crystal, emeralds, coral, white coral, red pearls, and so on, and if a tempest blew them to the island of the rākṣasīs, and if among them one being would call on Avalokiteśvara, they would all become freed from that island of the rākṣasīs.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if someone being led to execution were to call on Avalokiteśvara, the weapons of the executioners would break into pieces and be scattered around.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if this world realm of a thousand million worlds were to be filled with yakṣas and rākṣasas, none of them would even be able to look angrily at someone who possesses the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if there were beings who were bound in iron fetters or were placed in wooden stocks, whether they were guilty or not guilty, through calling out the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara those iron fetters and those wooden stocks would open. Noble one, that is the kind of power that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if this world realm of a thousand million worlds were to be filled with rogues, bandits, and foes who were holding weapons in their hands, and if a caravan leader was leading a great caravan of merchants who had obtained a great wealth in jewels, and those travelers saw the rogues, bandits, and foes holding weapons in their hands, and seeing them were frightened and terrified, knowing that they had no protection, and the caravan leader said to the caravan, ‘Do not be afraid! Noble ones, do not be afraid! Through calling out in one voice to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who brings freedom from fear, he will free you from this fear of bandits and the fear of foes,’ and then the entire great caravan called out in one voice to Avalokiteśvara, saying, ‘We pay homage, we pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who brings freedom from fear,’ the instant they called out his name, that entire great caravan would be freed from fear. Noble one, that is the kind of power that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if those beings who engage in the conduct of desire pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, they will become free from desire. If those beings who engage in the conduct of anger pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, they will become free from anger. If those beings who engage in the conduct of ignorance pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, they will become free from ignorance. Noble one, that is the kind of great miraculous power that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.</p>
<p>“Noble one, if a woman wishes to have a son and she pays homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a boy who has the qualities of having a good body, being good looking, and being attractive. He will be dear and pleasing to many people and will generate roots of merit. A woman who wishes to have a girl will give birth to a girl, a girl who has the qualities of having a good body, being good looking, and being attractive. She will be dear and pleasing to many people and will generate roots of merit. Noble one, that is the kind of power that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.</p>
<p>“Those who pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possess his name will obtain fruitful results.</p>
<p>“If we compare—to those who pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possess his name—those who pay homage to and possess the names of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty-two Ganges Rivers, or those who offer clothing, alms, beds, medicine at times of illness, and necessary utensils to living, present, and remaining buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty-two Ganges Rivers, then, noble son, what do you think? How much merit has such a noble man or noble woman created?”</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, it will be great!” replied the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati. “Sugata, the merit that those noble men and noble women will have created on that basis will be great.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” continued the Bhagavān, “the merit created by honoring those buddha bhagavāns will be the same, not more and not higher, as the merit created by paying homage just once to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possessing his name.</p>
<p>“The accumulation of merit from paying homage to and possessing the names of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty-two Ganges Rivers, and that created by paying homage just once to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possessing his name, will not easily be exhausted even in a hundred thousand quintillion eons.</p>
<p>“Noble one, in that way the merit from possessing the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is immeasurable.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati inquired of the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, how does the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara move around in this Sahā world realm? How does he teach the Dharma to beings? What is the scope of the skillful methods of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara like?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati, “Noble one, there are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of buddhas. There are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of bodhisattva mahāsattvas. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a pratyeka­buddha, to some in the form of a śrāvaka, to some in the form of Brahmā, and to some in the form of Śakra. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a gandharva. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to those beings who are to be guided by a yakṣa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Īśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Īśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Maheśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Maheśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a cakravartin to those beings who are to be guided by a cakravartin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of piśāca to those beings who are to be guided by a piśāca. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to those beings who are to be guided by Vaiśravaṇa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a general to those beings who are to be guided by a general. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a brahmin to those beings who are to be guided by a brahmin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vajrapāṇi to those beings who are to be guided by Vajrapāṇi.</p>
<p>“Noble one, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such inconceivable qualities. Therefore, make offerings to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara!</p>
<p>“Noble one, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gives freedom from fear to beings who are afraid. Therefore in this Sahā world realm he is known as ‘He Who Gives Freedom From Fear.’”</p>
<p>Then Akṣayamati said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, we will give a Dharma gift to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the Bhagavān, “know that it is the time, and give it.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati took from around his own neck a long necklace of pearls of the value of a hundred thousand silver coins and gave it as a Dharma gift to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, saying, “Superior being, accept from me this Dharma gift.” When he did not take it, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati implored the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, “Noble one, accept this string of pearls out of compassion for me!”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, with compassion for the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati, and through compassion for devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, accepted the string of pearls from the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati. When he had accepted it he divided it into two. One half he offered to Bhagavān Śākyamuni and one half he offered to the precious stūpa of the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna.</p>
<p>“Noble son, this is the manner in which the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara miraculously moves around in this Sahā world realm.”</p>
<p>Then his nature was described:</p>
<p>The multicolored banner, Akṣayamati,</p>
<p>Asked for the cause of this name’s meaning:</p>
<p>“For what reason is this son of the jinas</p>
<p>Called Avalokiteśvara?” {1}</p>
<p>Then he gazed into the directions</p>
<p>And spoke these words to that ocean of prayers,</p>
<p>That multicolored banner, Akṣayamati:</p>
<p>“Listen to the conduct of Avalokiteśvara. {2}</p>
<p>“For many countless billion eons,</p>
<p>Just as he had prayed, he purified himself</p>
<p>Under many thousands of millions of buddhas.</p>
<p>I shall describe this, so listen to me! {3}</p>
<p>“Hearing, seeing, and thus</p>
<p>Subsequently remembering this</p>
<p>Will be fruitful for beings in this world,</p>
<p>Eliminating all the suffering and misery of existence. {4}</p>
<p>“If someone were thrown by a murderer</p>
<p>Into a pit of fire in order to be killed,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>The fire would be extinguished as if by water. {5}</p>
<p>“If someone is crossing a perilous ocean</p>
<p>Where nāgas, makaras, asuras, and bhūtas reside,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>They will never sink in the water. {6}</p>
<p>“If someone were thrown by a murderer</p>
<p>Off the summit of Meru, in order to be killed,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>They would stay in the sky like the sun. {7}</p>
<p>“If a mountain made of vajra were thrown</p>
<p>Onto someone’s head to kill them,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Not even a pore would be harmed. {8}</p>
<p>“If a crowd of enemies surrounded someone,</p>
<p>Holding weapons, intending to kill them,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>In that instant they would become friends. {9}</p>
<p>“If someone is under the power of an executioner</p>
<p>And is approaching the place of execution,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>The executioner’s sword will disintegrate. {10}</p>
<p>“If someone is chained in iron fetters</p>
<p>Or imprisoned in wooden stocks,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Their bonds will quickly break apart. {11}</p>
<p>“Spirits and vetālas, who destroy the body,</p>
<p>From the power of mantras, spells, and herbs</p>
<p>Return to the place from where they were sent,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara. {12}</p>
<p>“If someone were surrounded by nāgas, yakṣas, asuras,</p>
<p>Bhūtas, and rākṣasas, who steal the vitality of beings,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Not even a pore would be harmed. {13}</p>
<p>“If someone were surrounded</p>
<p>By terrifying, malevolent wild beasts with sharp fangs,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>They would quickly scatter in all directions. {14}</p>
<p>“If someone were surrounded by snakes</p>
<p>Whose terrifying eyes emit light that is like fire,</p>
<p>If they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>They would quickly cease to be poisonous. {15}</p>
<p>“If thunderbolts and hail fall from dense clouds</p>
<p>Along with thunder and lightning,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>They will quickly cease in that instant. {16}</p>
<p>“He sees beings tormented by many sufferings,</p>
<p>Oppressed by many hundreds of sufferings.</p>
<p>He looks at them with the power of excellent wisdom</p>
<p>And thus he is the protector of the world and its devas. {17}</p>
<p>“He has attained the perfection of miraculous power;</p>
<p>He is skilled in vast wisdom and methods.</p>
<p>He sees the worlds everywhere in the ten directions</p>
<p>And all the realms without exception. {18}</p>
<p>“He ends the terrors of beings in the lower realms,</p>
<p>In unfortunate existences, and in the hells,</p>
<p>Who are animals, or under the command of Yama,</p>
<p>And the agonies of birth, aging, sickness, and death. {19}</p>
<p>“I strongly wish to see the beautiful eyes and face</p>
<p>Of the one who has virtuous eyes, loving eyes,</p>
<p>Who has the eyes that have special method and wisdom,</p>
<p>And has compassionate eyes and loving eyes. {20}</p>
<p>“He is an immaculate light, free of stains,</p>
<p>The sunlight of wisdom free of darkness,</p>
<p>A light that is not obscured by clouds,</p>
<p>Beautifully illuminating the world, {21}</p>
<p>“With the roar of conduct that comes from compassion,</p>
<p>And the good qualities of the great clouds of kindness.</p>
<p>You send down the nectar of the rain of the Dharma</p>
<p>That extinguishes the fire of the kleśas of beings. {22}</p>
<p>“If someone is in the midst of fighting and battle,</p>
<p>In the great terror of humans at war,</p>
<p>If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara</p>
<p>Immediately the enemies will be pacified. {23}</p>
<p>“The thunder from clouds, the beat of a drum,</p>
<p>Thunderclaps and the voice of Brahmā</p>
<p>Should make one think of Avalokiteśvara,</p>
<p>Who has reached the perfection of the scope of the voice. {24}</p>
<p>“Free of doubt, think and think again</p>
<p>Of that pure being, Avalokiteśvara.</p>
<p>When dying or tormented by pain</p>
<p>He will be your protector, refuge, and defender. {25}</p>
<p>“He has reached the perfection of all good qualities.</p>
<p>He has eyes of kindness and compassion for all beings.</p>
<p>He has true qualities, a great ocean of qualities.</p>
<p>One should pay homage to Avalokiteśvara. {26}</p>
<p>“He thus has compassion for beings,</p>
<p>And in a future time will become a buddha</p>
<p>Who will eliminate all fear and misery.</p>
<p>You should think of Avalokiteśvara. {27}</p>
<p>“He is the chief king, the lord of the world.</p>
<p>The world makes offerings to him, the source of the bhikṣus’ Dharma.</p>
<p>Having practiced for many hundreds of eons,</p>
<p>He has attained the stainless, highest enlightenment. {28}</p>
<p>“On the left or right of the guide Amitābha</p>
<p>He holds a fan and he fans him.</p>
<p>And through the samādhi similar to an illusion</p>
<p>He goes to all realms and makes offerings to the jinas. {29}</p>
<p>“In the western direction, in the source of happiness,</p>
<p>There is the stainless realm of Sukhāvatī.</p>
<p>There dwells the guide Amitāyus,</p>
<p>The one who is the leader of beings. {30}</p>
<p>“There are no females appearing there,</p>
<p>And there are absolutely no qualities of deception.</p>
<p>The sons of the jinas are born there miraculously,</p>
<p>Sitting on the center of stainless lotuses. {31}</p>
<p>“That guide Amitāyus</p>
<p>Is seated upon a lion throne</p>
<p>On the center of a delightful, stainless lotus,</p>
<p>And he is as beautiful as a sal tree. {32}</p>
<p>“There is no one in the three existences</p>
<p>That is similar to this guide of the world.</p>
<p>Whoever hears the name Avalokiteśvara,</p>
<p>Their merit will be inexhaustible.” {33}</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharaṇīṃdhara rose from his seat, removed his upper robe from one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, and with his hands together in homage bowed toward the Bhagavān and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, the beings who hear the chapter on the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who hear of his miraculous power, who hear the chapter called ‘Facing Everywhere: The Teaching of the Miracles of the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara,’ will not have inferior roots of merit.”</p>
<p>When the Bhagavān was teaching this teaching of this chapter “Facing Everywhere,” eighty-four thousand beings within that assembly developed the aspiration to attain the unequaled, highest, complete enlightenment.</p>
<p>This concludes “Facing Everywhere: The Teaching of the Miracles of Avalokiteśvara,” the twenty-fourth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Past of King Śubhavyūha</p>
<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>Then the Bhagavān said to the all-inclusive assembly of bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, in the past, in a time gone by, countless eons ago, at that time, in that era, in an eon named Priyadarśana, in a world named Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍitā, there appeared in that world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world’s beings, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­.</p>
<p>“During the time of the teaching of Tathāgata Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, there was a King Śubhavyūha.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, King Śubhavyūha had a wife named Vimaladattā.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, King Śubhavyūha had two sons. One was named Vimalagarbha and one was named Vimalanetra. Those two boys had miraculous power, wisdom, merit, and knowledge. They were dedicated to the practices of a bodhisattva, which means they were dedicated to the perfection of generosity, the perfection of good conduct, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of meditation, the perfection of wisdom, and the perfection of skillful method, love, compassion, rejoicing, equanimity, and the thirty-seven factors for enlightenment. They had perfected them all. They had perfected the samādhi stainless. They had perfected the samādhi of the constellations, stars, and the sun. They had perfected the samādhi of stainless light. They had perfected the samādhi of bright, stainless light. They had perfected the samādhi of gloriousadornment. They had perfected the samādhi of the essence of great brilliance.</p>
<p>“At that time, during that period, the Bhagavān, with compassion for beings and with compassion for King Śubhavyūha, taught this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra went to their birth mother and, with their ten fingers and palms placed together in homage, they said to their birth mother, ‘Mother, please come into the presence of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, so as to see, pay homage to, and honor the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­. For what reason? Mother, it is because the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ is teaching extensively the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to the world and its devas, and we are going to listen to it.’</p>
<p>“Noble sons, when they had said that, Queen Vimaladattā replied to Vimalagarbha and Vimalanetra, ‘Noble ones, your father, King Śubhavyūha, has faith in the brahmins; therefore you will not be given permission to see the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra, with their ten fingers and palms placed together in homage, said, ‘We have been born into a family that holds the wrong view; we are not sons of a Dharma king.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, noble ones,’ Queen Vimaladattā said to the boys, ‘perform some miracle, so that your father, King Śubhavyūha, will be sympathetic toward you. It is possible that he will be favorably inclined toward you. If he is favorably inclined, he will give us permission to go to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­.’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, at that time the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra rose into the air to the height of seven palm trees, and so that King Śubhavyūha would be sympathetic toward them they together performed miracles that are permitted by the Buddha. Having gone up into the air, they lay down there, they walked in the air, they shook themselves free of dust in the air, and then while in the air, the lower half of their bodies emitted streams of water, and the upper half of their bodies blazed with fire, and then the lower half of their bodies blazed with fire, and the upper half of their bodies emitted streams of water. Up in the air they became huge and then became small; they became small and then became huge. Up in the air they vanished and appeared down on the ground. After appearing on the ground they rose up into the air.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, those two boys, through performing those miracles, guided their father, King Śubhavyūha.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, when King Śubhavyūha saw the miracles that those two boys performed, he was pleased, delighted, overjoyed, joyful, and experienced happiness and pleasure. He placed his ten fingers and palms together in homage and asked those boys, ‘Noble ones, who is your teacher? Whose students are you?’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, those two boys said to King Śubhavyūha, ‘Great King, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ is alive, present, and remaining in this world. He sits upon a Dharma seat at the foot of a precious Bodhi tree. Before the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, he is teaching extensively the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. That Bhagavān is our teacher. Great King, we are his students.’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, King Śubhavyūha said to the two boys, ‘Noble ones, I also shall go before the Bhagavān and see your teacher.’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, the two boys descended from the sky, and went to where their birth mother was, and having arrived, placed their ten fingers and palms together in homage, and they said to their birth mother, ‘Mother, we have guided our father toward the highest, complete enlightenment. We have performed the role of teacher for our father. Therefore, Mother, it is now appropriate for you to let us go. We shall become renunciants under the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, at that time the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra recited these verses to their birth mother:</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, give us the permission</p>
<p>To become homeless renunciants.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a tathāgata.</p>
<p>We shall become renunciants! {1}</p>
<p>“ ‘Like the flower of the fig tree,</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to find a jina.</p>
<p>It is difficult to become endowed with opportunity.</p>
<p>Allow us to leave to become renunciants!’ {2}</p>
<p>“Queen Vimaladattā replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Today I shall release you both.</p>
<p>Children, depart excellently!</p>
<p>As it is difficult to find a tathāgata,</p>
<p>I also will become a renunciant.’ {3}</p>
<p>“Noble sons, when those boys had recited those verses, they said to their father and mother, ‘Father, Mother, this is excellent. Come, and together with you we shall go into the presence of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, in order to see the Bhagavān, pay homage to him, and honor him. For what reason? Because, Father, Mother, it is as difficult to find the appearance of a buddha as a flower on a fig tree, or for a turtle to put its neck through the hole of a yoke. Father, Mother, it is difficult to find the appearance of a buddha bhagavān and therefore, Father, Mother, based upon the highest merit, we have been born in the time of this teaching. Father, Mother, it is excellent that you let us go. We shall leave, we shall become renunciants under the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­. For what reason? It is difficult to obtain the sight of a tathāgata, it is difficult to find a king of the Dharma such as this in the present time, and because it is extremely difficult to attain being endowed with this kind of opportunity.’</p>
<p>“Noble ones, at that time King Śubhavyūha, together with his harem numbering eighty-four thousand, became recipients for the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“The boys Vimalagarbha and Vimalanetra practiced this Dharma teaching for a hundred thousand quintillion eons, thinking, ‘How can we eliminate the lower existences?’ They practiced the samādhi of eliminating the lower existences of all beings.</p>
<p>“Queen Vimaladattā, the mother of those boys, understood what is taught by all the buddhas, and the secret parts of the Dharma of all the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, those two boys guided King Śubhavyūha into the teaching of the Tathāgata, and caused him to follow it, and become completely ripened together with all his court. Together with Queen Vimaladattā and her courtiers, the two sons of King Śubhavyūha, forty-two thousand people, the harem, and the ministers, they all went into the presence of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­. When they had arrived, they bowed their head to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān seven times, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, knowing that King Śubhavyūha had arrived, taught them through speaking excellently about the Dharma, causing them to engage in it, encouraging them, and delighting them.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, when the Bhagavān taught King Śubhavyūha by speaking excellently about the Dharma, causing him to engage in it, encouraging him, and delighting him, the king became pleased, delighted, and overjoyed; he became joyful, and felt happiness and pleasure. He bound his turban on his younger brother’s head and made him king. Then together with his court, Queen Vimaladattā, the entire retinue of a crowd of women, and the two boys, accompanied by eighty-four thousand other beings, they became renunciants, leaving home for homelessness within the teaching of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­.</p>
<p>After becoming renunciants, King Śubhavyūha and his followers diligently contemplated, meditated on, and studied the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma for eighty-four thousand years.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, after eighty-four thousand years had passed, King Śubhavyūha attained the samādhi called the array of all adorning good qualities. As soon as he attained that samādhi, King Śubhavyūha rose in the air up to the height of seven palm trees.</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, in the middle of the sky King Śubhavyūha said these words to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­: ‘Bhagavān, my two sons are teachers. Through their miracles they turned me away from severe false doctrines and brought me into the Tathāgata’s teaching. They ripened me and caused me to practice. They inspired me to come see and pay homage to the Bhagavān. Bhagavān, these two boys are my kalyāṇamitras, who in order to make me remember my past roots of merit were born in my family in the form of boys.’</p>
<p>“The bhagavān tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ said to King Śubhavyūha, ‘Great King, it is so. It is as you have said. The noble men or noble women who have planted roots of merit, even though they are born in all the states where they come into existence and die and pass away, they will easily find a kalyāṇamitra, they will be near someone who will act as a teacher, and they will be given a prophecy of the highest, complete enlightenment, be guided toward it and ripened for it. In that way, Great King, it is a great occasion for someone to be cared for by a kalyāṇamitra and guided to see a tathāgata. Great King, do you see these two boys?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I see them, Bhagavān,’ the king replied. ‘I see them, Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King,’ said the Bhagavān, ‘these two boys have made offerings to as many tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas as there are grains of sand in sixty-five Ganges Rivers. Because of their compassion for beings, and in order to cause beings who have wrong views to be dedicated to the true view, they will be holders of this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.’</p>
<p>“Then, noble ones, King Śubhavyūha descended from the sky, and with his ten fingers and palms placed together in homage, he said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, ‘Bhagavān, what kind of wisdom does the Tathāgata possess, by which the Bhagavān, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly enlightened Buddha has a beautiful uṣṇīṣa, stainless eyes, a beautiful ūrṇā hair between the eyebrows that is as white and beautiful as the moon or a conch, the beautiful rows of teeth in his mouth that are even and perfectly aligned, the Sugata’s lips that are as red as the bimbā fruit, and the Sugata’s beautiful eyes? I request the Tathāgata to teach this.’</p>
<p>“Noble ones, King Śubhavyūha, having praised the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ through describing those qualities, then praised the Bhagavān through describing another hundred thousand quintillion qualities. At that time, he said to the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­, ‘Bhagavān, it is marvelous how much great benefit there is in the teaching of the Tathāgata, how the guidance of the Dharma taught by the Bhagavān is endowed with inconceivable qualities, and how excellent is the training of the Tathāgata. Bhagavān, from today onward, I will never again fall under the power of my mind. I will never again fall under the power of wrong views. I will never again fall under the power of anger. I will never again fall under the power of the arising of wicked thoughts. Bhagavān, if I again possess these bad qualities, I will not seek to come before the Bhagavān.’</p>
<p>“Then he bowed his head to the feet of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ and rose up into the air and remained there.</p>
<p>“Then King Śubhavyūha and Queen Vimaladattā cast into the air above the Bhagavān a string of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coins. As soon as they threw that string of pearls, it transformed into a kūṭāgāra in the air above the Bhagavān, which was made of strings of pearls, was quadrangular, with four pillars, well proportioned, symmetrical, and beautiful. In that kūṭāgāra appeared a throne spread with many hundreds of thousands of calico cloths. The Tathāgata appeared sitting cross-legged upon that throne.</p>
<p>“Then King Śubhavyūha thought, ‘This wisdom of buddhahood is very powerful. The Tathāgata has inconceivable qualities so that in this way the Tathāgata’s body is within the kūṭāgāra and is resplendent, beautiful, and has the perfect color.’</p>
<p>“Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Jala­dhara­garjita­ghoṣa­susvarana­kṣatra­rāja­saṃkusumitābhi­jña­ asked that fourfold assembly, ‘Bhikṣus, do you see King Śubhavyūha roaring the lion’s roar in the middle of the sky?’</p>
<p>“ ‘We see him,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhikṣus,’ said the Bhagavān, ‘King Śubhavyūha, having become a bhikṣu within my teaching, will appear in the world as the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the one who knows the world, the unsurpassable guide who tames beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavān named Śālendrarāja, in an eon named Abhyudgatarāja, in the world realm Vistīrṇavatī.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bhikṣus, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śālendrarāja will have an innumerable saṅgha of bodhisattvas and an innumerable saṅgha of śrāvakas. The world realm Vistīrṇavatī will be as level as the palm of a hand. In that way, that tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha will have inconceivable qualities.’</p>
<p>“Noble ones, if you are uncertain, unsure, or undecided, thinking that King Śubhavyūha at that time, on that occasion was someone else, do not have such a view. Why is that? This bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī was at that time, on that occasion, King Śubhavyūha.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, if you are uncertain, unsure, or undecided, thinking that Queen Vimaladattā at that time, on that occasion was someone else, do not have such a view. Why is that? This bodhisattva mahāsattva Vairocana­raśmi­prati­maṇḍita­dhvaja­rāja was at that time, on that occasion, Queen Vimaladattā, who out of compassion for King Śubhavyūha and those beings had made a commitment to become the wife of King Śubhavyūha.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, if you are uncertain, unsure, or undecided, thinking that the two boys at that time, on that occasion were someone else, do not have such a view. Why is that? It is Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bhaiṣajya­samudgata who at that time, on that occasion, were the sons of King Śubhavyūha.</p>
<p>“Therefore, noble ones, both Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bhaiṣajya­samudgata possess inconceivable qualities. They have planted roots of merit under many hundred thousand quintillions of buddhas. These higher beings are both truly superior through their inconceivable qualities. The world and its devas will pay homage to those who possess the names of these two high beings.”</p>
<p>When this chapter on the past was taught, eighty-four thousand beings gained pure, immaculate, stainless Dharma eyes.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Past of King Śubhavyūha,” the twenty-fifth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Samantabhadra’s Encouragement</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>The bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra, leading a following of countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas, and leading a following of countless devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans, came from the east, and the realms shook, a rain of lotuses fell, and a hundred thousand quintillion musical instruments played. With the great power of a bodhisattva, with the great manifestations of a bodhisattva, with the great miraculous power of a bodhisattva, with the great majesty of a bodhisattva, with the great brilliant magnificence of a bodhisattva, with the great way of a bodhisattva, with the great miracles of a bodhisattva, and with the great miraculous manifestation of leading a following of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans—it was with such an inconceivable miraculous manifestation that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra came to this Sahā world realm.</p>
<p>He came to Vulture Peak, to the Bhagavān, bowed his head to the Bhagavān’s feet, circumambulated the Bhagavān seven times, and said to the Bhagavān, “Bhagavān, I have come here from the buddha realm of the bhagavān tathāgata Ratna­tejobhyudgata­rāja. Bhagavān, I have come before the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in this Sahā world realm. Bhagavān, these hundred thousand bodhisattvas have also come to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. Therefore, Bhagavān, Tathāgata, Arhat, perfectly enlightened Buddha, teach extensively this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to these bodhisattva mahāsattvas.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra, “Noble one, these bodhisattva mahāsattvas all have instant comprehension. This Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is like this: it is inseparable from the true nature, the limit of reality, and the essence of phenomena.”</p>
<p>“Bhagavān it is so!” exclaimed those bodhisattvas. “Sugata, it is so!”</p>
<p>Then in order to establish the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had gathered in that assembly in this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra, “Noble one, a woman who has four qualities will obtain The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in her hands. What are these four? She will have the blessing of the buddha bhagavāns, she will have planted the roots of merit, she will be among the class of those who are determined, and she will have developed the aspiration to attain the highest, complete enlightenment in order to protect all beings.</p>
<p>“Noble son, a woman who has those four qualities will obtain this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in her hands.”</p>
<p>Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra declared, “Bhagavān in the later times, during the later times, in the last five hundred years of the Dharma, I will protect the bhikṣus who are upholding such a sūtra as this. I will bring them happiness. I will cause them to avoid punishment, and I will neutralize poison. Bhagavān, I will continually guard and protect those dharmabhāṇakas so that whoever seeks to harm them and seeks such an opportunity will not be able to find such an opportunity.</p>
<p>“The evil Māra, Māra’s sons, and the Mārakāyika devas, Māra’s maidens, and Mara’s retinue who seek to harm them and seek such an opportunity will not be able to find such an opportunity. No deva, yakṣa, rākṣasa, preta, pūtana, kṛtya, or vetāla that seeks to harm those dharmabhāṇakas and seeks for such an opportunity, will be able to find such an opportunity.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, when the dharmabhāṇakas are walking while dedicated to the practice of contemplating this Dharma teaching, at that time, in order to protect this Dharma teaching, I will mount a white, six-tusked king of elephants and, accompanied by an entourage of bodhisattvas, I shall come before those dharmabhāṇakas in the place where the dharmabhāṇakas are walking.</p>
<p>“When the dharmabhāṇakas who are dedicated to the practice of contemplating this Dharma teaching make a mistake in even one word or one letter of this Dharma teaching, at that time I will mount a white, six-tusked king of elephants and reveal myself to them and I will repeat the Dharma teaching correctly. Those dharmabhāṇakas will see my body and hear from me this Dharma teaching correctly and they will be pleased, delighted, and overjoyed—they will be joyful, and experience happiness and pleasure—and they will be dedicated to this Dharma teaching. As soon as they see me they will attain samādhi. They will attain the power of mental retention that is called the convergence of retentions. They will attain the power of mental retention that is called a trillion convergences. They will attain the power of mental retention that is called expertise in all sounds.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, in the later times, during the later times, in the last five hundred years of the Dharma, I will reveal my body, the sight of which brings happiness to all beings, to the bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, the upāsakas or upāsikās who possess such a sūtra as this, who write out such a sūtra as this, who seek for such a sūtra as this, who read such a sūtra as this, and who in the later times, during the later times, in the last five hundred years of the Dharma, are dedicated to walking, for the sake of this Dharma teaching, for three weeks—twenty-one days. I will mount a white, six-tusked king of elephants and, accompanied by an entourage of bodhisattvas, I shall come before those dharmabhāṇakas in the place where those dharmabhāṇakas are walking for twenty-one days. When I have arrived there I will reveal myself to those dharmabhāṇakas, inspire them to uphold it, encourage them, and bring them joy. I shall give them a dhāraṇī so that no one will be able to harm those dharmabhāṇakas, no human or nonhuman will find such an opportunity and no woman will beguile them. I shall protect them. I shall save them from punishment. I shall counteract poison. Bhagavān, I shall give the dharmabhāṇakas these dhāraṇī words:</p>
<p>“Tadyathā:adaṇḍe daṇḍapati daṇḍāvartani daṇḍakuśale daṇḍasudhāri sudhārapati buddhapaśyane sarvadhāraṇi āvartani saṃvartani saṃgha­parīkṣite saṃgha­nirghātani dharma­parīkṣite sarva­sattva­ruta­kauśalye kauśalyānugate siṃhavikrīḍite anuvarte vartani vartāli svāhā.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the bodhisattvas, to whose faculty of hearing comes the sound of these dhāraṇī words, should know that they are the blessing of Samantabhadra.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, while this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is existing in this Jambudvīpa, the bodhisattvas into whose hands it comes, those dharmabhāṇakas, Bhagavān, should know that this Dharma teaching has come into their hands through the power of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra, and through the magnificence of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the beings who write out this sūtra and who uphold it have obtained the activity of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra. Those beings will be those who have planted roots of merit under many buddhas.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, those beings will have their heads stroked by the hand of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, those beings who write out this sūtra and who uphold it will please me.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, those beings who write out this sūtra, and those who study it after having written it out, Bhagavān, when they pass away they will be reborn as one of the devas of Trāyastriṃśa. The moment they are reborn there, in front of them will be eighty-four thousand deva maidens, and as devas with crowns the size of bherī drums they will dwell among those deva maidens.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, the accumulation of merit of those beings who write out this Dharma teaching is like that, let alone that of those who transmit it, chant it, contemplate it, and keep it in mind.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma should be contemplated in the mind and written out. If someone keeps it in mind without distraction and writes it out, a hundred thousand buddhas will extend their hands toward them. When they die they will see a thousand buddhas. They will not fall into the lower existences at death. When they pass away from this world they will be reborn among the devas of Tuṣita. They will be reborn where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, possessing the thirty-two signs of a superior being, is teaching the Dharma accompanied by an entourage of bodhisattvas and attended upon by a hundred thousand quintillion deva maidens.</p>
<p>“Therefore, a wise noble man or noble woman should respectfully write out this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma. They should respectfully transmit it. They should respectfully read it aloud. They should respectfully keep it in mind.</p>
<p>“Bhagavān, someone who writes out this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, transmits it, reads it aloud, meditates on it, and keeps it in mind will have countless qualities.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, a wise noble man or noble woman should possess this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma and they will have the benefit of that great number of qualities.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Bhagavān, I will give my blessing to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma so that through my blessing this Dharma teaching will continue to exist in Jambudvīpa.”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra, “It is excellent, Samantabhadra, excellent that for the benefit of many beings you, who are thus endowed with inconceivable qualities, with a superior motivation of compassion, and with an inconceivable aspiration, are blessing this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.</p>
<p>“The noble men or noble women who possess the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samantabhadra should be known to be those who have seen the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni and have heard this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma directly from Tathāgata Śākyamuni, have made offerings to Tathāgata Śākyamuni, have lauded Tathāgata Śākyamuni’s teaching of the Dharma, and have rejoiced in this Dharma teaching. Tathāgata Śākyamuni will have placed his hand upon their heads. They will have dressed Śākyamuni in Dharma robes.</p>
<p>“Samantabhadra, those noble men or noble women should be known to be the holders of the Tathāgata’s teaching. They will not delight in the Lokāyatas. They will not delight in those who recite poetry. They will not delight in dancing, music, wrestling, meat sellers, butchers, chicken sellers, pig sellers, or pimps. Those who have heard, have written out, possess, and read such a sūtra as this will have no craving for anything else. Those beings will possess the essence of the Dharma. They will have their own correct attention. They will possess the power of their own merit. Beings will be happy to see them.</p>
<p>“The bhikṣus who possess such a sūtra as this will not be tormented by desire. They will be without anger, ignorance, envy, miserliness, hypocrisy, pride, arrogance, and mistaken pride.</p>
<p>“Samantabhadra, those dharmabhāṇakas will be satisfied with whatever they obtain.</p>
<p>“Samantabhadra, in the later times, during the later times of the last five hundred years of the Dharma, if someone sees a bhikṣu who is a holder of this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma, they should think, ‘This noble man is going to go to the Bodhimaṇḍa. This noble man is going to be victorious over Māra’s army. This noble man is going to turn the wheel of the Dharma. He is going to beat the drum of the Dharma. He is going to blow the conch of the Dharma. He is going to send down a rain of the Dharma. He is going to sit upon the lion throne of the Dharma.’ Those are the thoughts that should arise in their minds.</p>
<p>“In the later times, during the later times of the last five hundred years of the Dharma, the bhikṣus who are holders of this Dharma teaching will not have cravings, will have no attachment to Dharma robes, and will have no attachment to their alms bowls. Those dharmabhāṇakas will be honest. Those dharmabhāṇakas will have attained the three liberations. They will have turned away from this life.</p>
<p>“Those who criticize bhikṣus who are holders of such a sūtra as this will become blind. Those who speak unpleasantly to bhikṣus who are holders of such a sūtra as this will in that life have a discolored body. Those who ridicule and mock those who write out such a sūtra as this will have broken teeth, blackened teeth, ugly lips, flat noses, disfigured legs and arms, defective eyes, and a bad body odor. Their bodies will be covered with blisters, rashes, sores, abscesses, and itching spots.</p>
<p>“If someone says something unpleasant, whether it is true or not, to someone who upholds such a sūtra as this, who writes out such a sūtra as this, who reads aloud such a sūtra as this, who teaches such a sūtra as this, they should be known to have extremely heavy, bad karma.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Samantabhadra, one should stand up for bhikṣus who hold this Dharma teaching, even when they are far away. One should respect those bhikṣus who hold such a sūtra as this just as one would respect the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>When this chapter on “Samantabhadra’s Encouragement” was being taught, bodhisattva mahāsattavas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River attained the power of mental retention called a trillion convergences.</p>
<p>This concludes “Samantabhadra’s Encouragement,” the twenty-sixth chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Entrusting</p>
<p>Chapter 27</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni rose from his Dharma seat and manifested the miracle of his right hand taking hold of the right hands of those in the entire gathering of bodhisattvas. At that time he said, “Noble ones, this highest, complete enlightenment that I accomplished after a hundred thousand quintillion asaṃkhyeya eons I place in your hands: I entrust it to you, I present it to you, and I pass it on to you. Noble ones, you should do whatever will make it extensively widespread.”</p>
<p>A second time and a third time the Bhagavān with his right hand took hold of the right hands of those in the entire gathering of bodhisattvas and said, “Noble ones, this highest, complete enlightenment that I accomplished after a hundred thousand quintillion asaṃkhyeya eons I place in your hands: I entrust it to you, I present it to you, and I pass it on to you.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, you should receive this and possess it, read it, study it, teach it, explain it, and make it known to all beings.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, I am without avarice, I have no clinging, and I fearlessly give to you the wisdom of buddhahood. I give you the wisdom of the tathāgatas and the self-arisen wisdom.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, you should practice as I have. Be without avarice and make known to the noble men and noble women who come to you this Dharma teaching that is a great skillful method for seeing the wisdom of the tathāgatas. Lead into this Dharma teaching the noble men or noble women who have faith, and also those beings who do not have faith.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, if you do that, then you will have repaid the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>When the bhagavān tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni had said that, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas were overjoyed and filled with happiness. With great veneration they bowed, bowed down, bowed deeply toward the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni, and with their heads bowed down and their hands placed together in homage they spoke in one voice to the bhagavān tathāgata Śākyamuni: “Bhagavān, we shall accomplish all that the Tathāgata has instructed us to do. We shall fulfill all the instructions that the Tathāgata has given. Bhagavān, be at ease and be content.” That entire gathering of bodhisattvas declared a second time and a third time in one voice, “Bhagavān, be at ease and be content. We shall accomplish all that the Tathāgata has instructed us to do. We shall fulfill all the instructions that the Tathāgata has given.”</p>
<p>Then the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Śākyamuni gave leave to the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who had come from other world realms to depart, telling those tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas to dwell happily by saying, “Tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas, dwell happily!”</p>
<p>The stūpa of the bhagavān, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna was remaining in the same place, and he also said, “Dwell happily,” to that tathāgata, arhat, perfectly enlightened buddha.</p>
<p>When the Bhagavān had said those words, the countless, innumerable tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas who had come from other world realms and were seated on lion thrones at the foot of precious trees, the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna, the entire gathering of countless, innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas, the great śrāvakas, the fourfold assembly, and the world with its devas, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced, and praised the words of the Bhagavān.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Entrusting,” the twenty-seventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma.”</p>
<p>Noble ones should go</p>
<p>Wherever this sūtra is present,</p>
<p>Even if they have to breach a pit of burning embers</p>
<p>Or scale a pile of razorblades to get there.</p>
<p>This concludes the glorious Dharma teaching of “The White Lotus of the Good Dharma,” the great extensive sūtra, the instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhas, which is the great secret of the buddhas, which is concealed by all the buddhas, which is the family of all the buddhas, which is the secret subject of all the buddhas, which is the essence of enlightenment of all the buddhas, which is the Dharma wheel turned by all the buddhas, which is the union of all the buddhas in one body, which is the great skillful method taught as one yāna, and which is the sūtra that teaches the ultimate accomplishment.</p>
