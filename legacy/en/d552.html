<h1>The Eight Maidens’ Praise of Mañjuśrī, Lord of Speech</h1>
</header>
<p>Possessor of youthful body,</p>
<p>Adorned by the lamp of wisdom</p>
<p>That removes the darkness of delusion from the world—</p>
<p>Homage to Mañjughoṣa.</p>
<p>Your flood of radiance</p>
<p>Outshines the full moon</p>
<p>And banishes ignorance—</p>
<p>Homage to Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>Upon whose topknot, uncreated and vivid,</p>
<p>Rests a form glittering with gems,</p>
<p>Whose body is a delight to all—</p>
<p>Homage to you, Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>Like ambrosia, soft and deep,</p>
<p>The pleasing sound of your voice, </p>
<p>O holy one, trove of Dharma jewels—</p>
<p>Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>Countless as drops of water in the Ganges</p>
<p>Are the stains of affliction</p>
<p>You dispel in every world—</p>
<p>Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>Terrifying is your body’s manner</p>
<p>When, fangs bared in fearsome pose,</p>
<p>You shatter the Lord of Death’s arrogance—</p>
<p>Homage and praise to you, Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>You are beautified by a blue utpala</p>
<p>That is like your eyes in luster,</p>
<p>As you bear an alms bowl in your hand—</p>
<p>Homage to you, Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>With immense offerings and praise</p>
<p>To the buddhas dwelling in the ten directions</p>
<p>We pay homage to you, Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Teacher of the path to liberation.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Eight Maidens’ Praise.”</p>
