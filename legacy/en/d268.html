<h1>The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra</h1>
</header>
<p>The Sūtra of King of the Inconceivable</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling at the seat of awakening, a secluded hermitage in the land of Magadha, where he was seated upon a lion throne in the center of a lotus, inlaid with vajras and precious jewels. He was accompanied by a great bodhisattva assembly of as many bodhisattva great beings as there are atoms in the millions of billions of utterly indescribable buddhafields throughout the ten directions.</p>
<p>The bodhisattva great being King of the Inconceivable addressed those bodhisattva great beings: “O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in this Sahā world, the buddhafield of the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, is but a single day in the realm of Sukhāvatī, the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Amitāyus.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the realm of Sukhāvatī, the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Amitāyus, is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Vajrapramardin.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Vajrapramardin is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Lotus Body Blooming from Dense Light Rays.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Lotus Body Blooming from Dense Light Rays is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Dharmadhvaja.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, an eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Dharmadhvaja is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Siṃha.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Siṃha is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Vairocana.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Vairocana is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Flower Body Blooming from the Light of the Dharma.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Flower Body Blooming from the Light of the Dharma is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha King of Wisdom Light.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, a single eon in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha King of Wisdom Light is but a single day in the buddhafield of the thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect Buddha Candrabuddhi.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, continuing with this system of calculating eons, after a distance equal to the total atoms in ten oceans of buddhafield realms, we arrive at the equivalent of a single day in the realm of Padmaśrī, the buddhafield where the blessed, thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect buddha, the victorious Bhadraśrī resides.</p>
<p>“O children of the Victorious One, the names of these thus-gone, worthy, and completely perfect buddhas will be heard by bodhisattva great beings who uphold the conduct of the bodhisattva great being Samantabhadra and who are under the care of a spiritual teacher. They will not, however, be heard by anyone else.”</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had spoken these words, the bodhisattva great being King of the Inconceivable, and the entire retinue of bodhisattva great beings and the whole world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, all rejoiced  and praised the words of the Blessed One and the bodhisattva great being King of the Inconceivable.</p>
<p>This completes the noble Mahāyāna sūtra “The Sūtra of King of the Inconceivable.”</p>
