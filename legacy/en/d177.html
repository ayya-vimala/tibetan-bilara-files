<p>Mañjuśrī’s Teaching</p>
<p>Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park, the Jeta Grove in Śrāvastī, together with a great congregation of 1,250 monks and five thousand bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>At that time, the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma surrounded and venerated by an audience of many hundreds of thousands. Youthful Mañjuśrī then hoisted a jeweled parasol measuring ten yojanas in circumference and held it directly over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>Present in the retinue, along with his entourage, was a god from the house of Santuṣita called Susīma, whose progress toward unsurpassed and perfect awakening had become irreversible. He now rose from his seat, approached the place where Youthful Mañjuśrī was, and addressed him: “Mañjuśrī, aren’t you satisfied with your offering to the Blessed One?”</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī asked in return, “Divine being, tell me, is the great ocean ever satisfied by having water poured into it?”</p>
<p>“Mañjuśrī, no, it is not,” replied the god.</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī said, “Divine being, likewise, the wisdom of omniscience is as profound, immeasurable, and boundless as the great ocean. Those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to search for that wisdom should never be content in their desire to make offerings to the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>The god then asked, “Mañjuśrī, with what purpose in mind should offerings be made to the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī replied, “Divine being, offerings should be made to the Tathāgata with four purposes in mind. What are those four? They are (1) the purpose of the mind of awakening, (2) the purpose of liberating all sentient beings, (3) the purpose that the lineage of the Three Jewels will continue uninterrupted, and (4) the purpose of purifying all buddha realms. Divine being, it is with these four purposes in mind that offerings should be made to the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>When Mañjuśrī had spoken, the god Susīma, the monks, nuns, bodhisattvas, and the entire retinue, along with the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, rejoiced and praised the words of Youthful Mañjuśrī.</p>
<p>This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra, “Mañjuśrī’s Teaching.”</p>
<p>This was translated, edited, and finalized by the Indian preceptor Surendrabodhi and the chief editor and translator Bandé Yeshé Dé.</p>
