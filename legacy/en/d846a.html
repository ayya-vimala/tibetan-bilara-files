<h1>The Threefold Ritual</h1>
</header>
<p>Brahmā, great king Śakra, gods and nāgas,</p>
<p>Yakṣas, gandharvas, uragas, asuras,</p>
<p>Garuḍas, kumbhāṇḍas, kinnaras,</p>
<p>All beings who are sons of the Sugata,</p>
<p>Accept these seven wonderful and resplendent jewels and listen to me.</p>
<p>The qualities of the blessed Buddha are inconceivable.</p>
<p>The qualities of the holy Dharma are inconceivable.</p>
<p>The qualities of the noble Saṅgha are inconceivable.</p>
<p>The unsurpassed fruition of true faith</p>
<p>In the inconceivable Three Jewels is inconceivable.</p>
<p>It is rare to hear so much as the names of the Three Jewels,</p>
<p>Even over the course of millions of eons.</p>
<p>Now that you have taken such a rare embodiment endowed with the freedoms,</p>
<p>Use the energy of your magical abilities and faith to approach,</p>
<p>And listen to the profound teaching of the Victor</p>
<p>In this sanctuary bedecked with the jewels of liberation.</p>
<p>May those who gather here intent upon the holy Dharma,</p>
<p>Such as powerful gods, nāgas, yakṣas, and the like,</p>
<p>Accept this share of Dharma merit: we dedicate it</p>
<p>So that you may increase in splendor and retinue and accomplish what you desire.</p>
<p>May you obtain the nectar of the teachings,</p>
<p>Bring prosperity to each and every class of beings wherever they are,</p>
<p>And protect the teachings of the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Threefold Ritual.”</p>
