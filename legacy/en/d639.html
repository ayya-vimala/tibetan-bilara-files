<p>One Hundred and Eight Names of Youthful Mañjuśrī Accompanied by His Dhāraṇī-Mantra</p>
<p>Homage to the perfectly and completely awakened buddhas of the ten directions, whose minds, utterly wondrous and pure, pervade the entire domain of knowable things.</p>
<p>Youthful Mañjuśrī, your heart is free of any stain or flaw, your body ornamented by an effulgent constellation of untainted virtues. Gods, humans, asuras, nāgas, and vidyādharas touch their topknots and the tips of their crowns to the lotus beneath your feet. Homage to you!</p>
<p>Mañjughoṣa, great bodhisattva who vanquishes the various states of misery, we pay homage to you.</p>

<p>No sooner did Mañjughoṣa speak</p>
<p>This vidyāmantra, which accomplishes all aims,</p>
<p>Than the birth and aging of sentient beings</p>
<p>Were extinguished.</p>
<p>All states of misery were pacified,</p>
<p>And Māra’s armies shuddered.</p>
<p>All the gods were delighted,</p>
<p>And the vināyakas were terrified.</p>
<p>The very instant this dhāraṇī,</p>
<p>Which pacifies sins, was spoken,</p>
<p>Countless hundreds of millions of beings</p>
<p>Were freed from the prison of saṃsāra.</p>
<p>When Youthful Mañjuśrī,</p>
<p>Praising Mañjughoṣa,</p>
<p>Spoke the vidyāmantra,</p>
<p>It shook the ground,</p>
<p>And what moves and does not move upon it,</p>
<p>Together with crag, forest, and grove,</p>
<p>As the radiance of the buddhas’ light rays</p>
<p>Covered the face of the earth.</p>
<p>All the vighnas and vināyakas,</p>
<p>And the rākṣasas, frightful in form,</p>
<p>Cried out in harmony:</p>
<p>“We bow to the one who possesses the ten strengths!”</p>
<p>The gods who bear a peaceful demeanor,</p>
<p>All their minds delighted,</p>
<p>Came before the bearer</p>
<p>Of the great vajra sword and said,</p>
<p>“Homage to the granter of the highest, highest vajra,</p>

<p>“And have now been praised</p>
<p>By the wild and fierce great vighnas, vināyakas,</p>
<p>Yakṣas, asuras, rākṣasas,</p>
<p>And ojohāras.”</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, with a gesture of his sublime vajra,</p>
<p>Looked about and was pleased,</p>
<p>And holding all those beings in his regard,</p>
<p>He spoke thus:</p>
<p>“May you all be free of obstacles forever,</p>
<p>And may you attain the highest welfare and liberation.</p>
<p>May you find no danger, but goodness and fortune instead—</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of me.”</p>
<p>Then the Tathāgata boomed with thunderous laughter,</p>
<p>Turned his dazzling visage</p>
<p>Toward the east,</p>
<p>And spoke, saying,</p>
<p>“Kye-ma! A vast store of sentient beings’ merit</p>
<p>Has arisen</p>
<p>To dispel their gloom,</p>
<p>The object of the sublime mantra.</p>
<p>“Kye-ma! This boon-bestowing dhāraṇī</p>
<p>Has been revealed by Mañju’s recitation</p>
<p>To purify sentient beings</p>
<p>Who have created great merit.</p>
<p>“Some, entering into equipoise,</p>
<p>Recite this dhāraṇī and succeed</p>
<p>In dispelling all suffering—</p>
<p>For others, to hear or contemplate it is sufficient.</p>
<p>“It will accomplish all their aims</p>
<p>And free them from all suffering.</p>
<p>With it they are sure to succeed</p>
<p>In the purification of all their evil.</p>
<p>“Before long they will attain</p>
<p>The great ground of the tathāgatas.</p>
<p>Those great sentient beings who wish to inhabit</p>
<p>The great and holy bodhisattva grounds—</p>
<p>Joyful, Stainless,</p>
<p>Luminous, Radiant,</p>
<p>Invincible, Immediacy,</p>
<p>Far Reaching, Immovable,</p>
<p>Eminence, and Cloud of Dharma—</p>
<p>Will, at the end of their lives, arrive there unimpeded.</p>
<p>“They will attain the unexcelled awakening</p>
<p>That purifies all sin,</p>
<p>That is pleasing to all sentient beings,</p>
<p>And that pacifies all elaboration.</p>
<p>“Those who rise in the morning</p>
<p>And, with a serene mind,</p>
<p>Join their palms together</p>
<p>To Mañjughoṣa before them and recite</p>
<p>“These one hundred and eight alluring, auspicious,</p>
<p>And supremely virtuous names</p>
<p>That invoke all the wielders of vidyāmantra</p>
<p>And that pacify all evil—</p>
<p>“They will be protected, always,</p>
<p>By all the wielders of vidyāmantra</p>
<p>And by the lords of the gods</p>
<p>And the many yakṣas and rākṣasas.</p>
<p>“They will be protected, in all certainty,</p>
<p>By all the tathāgatas’ heirs,</p>
<p>The tathāgatas themselves,</p>
<p>And the bearers, too, of vajra weapons.</p>
<p>“They will dwell in the body of a buddha,</p>
<p>And they will appear in equipoise.</p>
<p>The yakṣas and the lords of the gods,</p>
<p>The vighnas and the great vināyakas—</p>
<p>In delight and with holy intentions—</p>
<p>Will prostrate to them from afar.</p>
<p>Therefore, owing to their delight, the vighnas</p>
<p>Will find themselves no longer able to do harm.</p>
<p>“A single recitation will bring about the attainment</p>
<p>Of merit equal to that of a great brahmā.</p>
<p>When a person of great wisdom</p>
<p>Has recited daily the sublime names,</p>
<p>“They will attain stainlessness and purity,</p>
<p>Clarity and a pleasing voice,</p>
<p>And a station that is delightful</p>
<p>And alluring to every sentient being.</p>
<p>“This dhāraṇī, proclaimed by the victors, is unparalleled.</p>
<p>It gives rise to the powers, leads one to the supreme path,</p>
<p>And is praised by the luminous pledge-deities.</p>
<p>It is enchanting and desired by the hosts of gods and asuras.”</p>
