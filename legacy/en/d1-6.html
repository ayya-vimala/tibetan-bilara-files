<p>I. The Authorization of Medicines</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada. On that occasion some monks  caught an autumn disease. Because they had caught an autumn disease, they turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why have these monks turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened?”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda replied, “Honored One, these monks caught an autumn disease. Because they caught an autumn disease, they have turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “on account of that, I authorize monks to consume medicines.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One said “monks may consume medicines,” the monks consumed medicines at the appropriate time (morning) but did not consume them after the appropriate time, because they were monks who were in the habit of eating at the appropriate time. Therefore, the monks turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, I said ‘monks may consume medicines.’ Why, then, have these monks turned pale, become emaciated, lost their strength, and been weakened?”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda replied, “The Blessed One said ‘monks may consume medicines,’ but they consumed medicines at the appropriate time and did not consume them after the appropriate time, because they are monks who are in the habit of eating at the appropriate time. Therefore, they turned pale, became emaciated, lost their strength, and were weakened.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, on account of that, I authorize monks to consume four kinds of medicines: medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time, medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days, and medicines to be consumed throughout life.</p>
<p>“Among them, the medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time are manthā, boiled rice, kulmāṣa, meat, and apūpa.</p>
<p>“The medicines to be consumed at night are the eight kinds of drinks: coconut drink, banana drink, kola drink, aśvattha drink, udumbara drink, parūṣaka drink, grape drink, and kharjūra drink.”</p>
<p>A Section Index:</p>
<p>Coconut, banana, kola,</p>
<p>Aśvattha, udumbara,</p>
<p>Parūṣaka, grape,</p>
<p>And kharjūra, which is the eighth.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed within seven days are butter oil, oil, phāṇita, honey, and śarkarā.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed throughout life are medicines derived from roots, medicines derived from stalks, medicines derived from leaves, medicines derived from flowers, medicines derived from fruits, the five kinds of resin, the five kinds of ashes, the five kinds of salt, and the five kinds of astringents.</p>
<p>“Among these medicines, the medicines derived from roots are musta, vaca, turmeric, ginger, ativiṣā, and what belong to the medicines derived from roots but are not used as ingredients in a meal. The medicines derived from stalks are sandal, cavikā, padmaka, devadāru, guḍūcī, dāruharidrā, and what belong to the medicines derived from stalks but are not used as ingredients in a meal. The medicines derived from leaves are from paṭola leaves, vāśaka leaves, nimba leaves, kośātakī leaves, saptaparṇa leaves, and what belong to the medicines derived from leaves but are not used as ingredients in a meal. The medicines derived from flowers are from five kinds of flowers: vāśaka flowers, nimba flowers, dhātakī flowers, sha ta flowers, padmakesara flowers, and what belong to the medicines derived from flowers but are not used as ingredients in a meal. The medicines derived from fruits are harītakī, āmalaka, vibhītaka, black pepper, long pepper, and what belong to the medicines derived from fruits but are not used as ingredients in a meal.</p>
<p>“The five kinds of resin are hiṅgu, sarjarasa, lac, beeswax, and ‘heat medicine.’</p>
<p>“Among them, hiṅgu is resin from the hiṅgu tree. Sarjarasa is resin from the sāla tree. Lac is lākṣā. Beeswax is siktha. ‘Heat medicine’ is resin from other trees.</p>
<p>“What are the five kinds of ashes? They are barley ash, barley-straw ash, ash from the sarjikā tree, sesame ash, and ash from the vāśakā tree.</p>
<p>“What are the five kinds of salt? They are salt from the Indus, brown salt, salt from Suvarcala, salt from Romaka, and salt from the ocean.</p>
<p>“What are the five kinds of astringents? They are āmra astringent, nimba astringent, jambū astringent, śirīṣa astringent, and kośambaka astringent.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time, medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days, and medicines to be consumed throughout life should be consumed at the appropriate time if they are mixed with medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time. In that situation, these medicines should not be consumed at an inappropriate time (afternoon or night).</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days, and medicines to be consumed throughout life should be consumed during the night if they are mixed with medicines to be consumed at night. In that situation, these medicines should not be consumed after that night.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed within seven days and medicines to be consumed throughout life should be consumed within seven days if they are mixed with medicines to be consumed within seven days. In that situation, these medicines should not be consumed after seven days.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed throughout life should be consumed after someone has taken formal possession of them as medicines to be consumed throughout life.  Formal possession of the medicines should be taken in this manner: The monk who wishes to consume that medicine should wash his hands before he eats a meal, accept the medicine, sit down before another monk, and say, ‘Venerable One, please pay attention. I, named So-and-so (the monk says his name), take formal possession of this medicine as medicine to be consumed throughout life for myself and my fellow monks.’ He should say this a second and a third time. Formal possession of medicines to be consumed at night and medicines to be consumed within seven days should also be taken in the same manner as medicines to be consumed throughout life.”</p>
<p>II. Fat</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>A monk had a wind illness and went to a physician. The monk said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the physician, “consume some fat and you will recover your health.”</p>
<p>The monk said, “Sir, what am I? A cannibal?”</p>
<p>“Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should consume some fat.”</p>
<p>As the monks did not know what kind of fat they should consume, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said, “Noble ones, since your teacher is omniscient, go to him and ask.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Five kinds of fats should be consumed. What are the five? They are fish fat, porpoise fat, crocodile fat, bear fat, and pig fat. But these five kinds of fats should not be consumed if they have been boiled at an inappropriate time, strained at an inappropriate time, or given at an inappropriate time, or if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time.</p>
<p>“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time, but strained at an inappropriate time, and given at an inappropriate time, and if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time, they should not be consumed.</p>
<p>“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time and strained at the appropriate time, but given at an inappropriate time, and if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time, the fats should not be consumed.</p>
<p>“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time, strained at the appropriate time, and given at the appropriate time, but the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at an inappropriate time, the fats should not be consumed.</p>
<p>“If the fats have been boiled at the appropriate time, strained at the appropriate time, and given at the appropriate time, and if the monk who needs some fat has taken formal possession of the fat at the appropriate time, the fats should be consumed within seven days in the same manner that you would consume oil.”</p>
<p>The monk then consumed the fat and his health returned. When his health returned, he threw away the remains of the fat. Later, another monk contracted the same disease, and he also went to the physician and said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>The physician also prescribed fat for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable one, you consumed fat and the physician also prescribed fat for me. Are there any remains of the fat?”</p>
<p>“Indeed there were remains, but I threw them away,” replied the first monk.</p>
<p>The second monk told him, “It wasn’t good to do that.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks should not throw away the remains of fat but should keep them. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps fat. A monk who keeps fat should give the remains of the fat to another monk. If the first monk does not give the remains to another monk, the first monk should put the remains in the infirmary. Anyone who needs fat should take it. If a monk who keeps the remains of fat does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>III. Scabies</p>
<p>The Blessed One was once dwelling in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>At that time, a monk had scabies.  He went to a physician and said, “Sir, since I have scabies, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the physician, “use an astringent and you will recover your health.”</p>
<p>“Sir, what am I? One who is intoxicated with lust?”</p>
<p>“Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should use an astringent.”</p>
<p>As the monks did not know what kind of astringent they should use, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said, “Since your teacher is omniscient, he himself must know.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “There are five kinds of astringents: āmra astringent, . . . .”</p>
<p>When the monk kneaded the astringent and smeared it on his body, the rash spread. The Blessed One said, “You should make the astringent into a powder.”</p>
<p>When the monks ground the damp astringent into a powder, it became lumpy. The Blessed One said, “You should dry the astringent.”</p>
<p>When they dried the astringent in the sun, it lost its efficacy. The Blessed One said, “You should not dry the astringent in the sun.”</p>
<p>When they dried the astringent in the shade, it began to decompose. The Blessed One said, “You should dry the astringent in the shade where it is warm.”</p>
<p>The monk bathed after he smeared his body with the astringent, so the astringent did not work. The Blessed One said, “You should bathe after completely rubbing the astringent with your hands into your skin. If, after you bathe, you again smear the astringent and bathe, the astringent will work.”</p>
<p>When the monk smeared the astringent, the illness went away. He threw the remains of the astringent away. Later, another monk had the same disease, and he also went to the physician and said, “Sir, since I have a disease like this, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>The physician also prescribed an astringent for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable One, you used an astringent and the physician also prescribed an astringent for me. Are there any remains of the astringent?”</p>
<p>The first monk said, “I threw them away.”</p>
<p>The second monk told him, “It wasn’t good to do that.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One,  the Blessed One said, “I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps astringents. A monk who keeps astringents should give the remains of the astringent to another monk who needs them. If the first monk does not give the remains to another monk, he should put the remains of the astringent in the infirmary. If a monk who keeps astringents does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>IV. Collyrium</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>A monk had an eye disease and went to a physician. The monk said, “Sir, since I have an eye disease, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the physician, “use collyrium and you will recover your health.”</p>
<p>“Sir, what am I? One who is intoxicated with lust?”</p>
<p>“Monk, this is your medicine,” replied the physician. “You cannot recover your health with other medicines.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘Monk, this is your medicine. You cannot recover your health with other medicines,’ you should use collyrium.”</p>
<p>As the monks did not know what kind of collyrium to use, they asked the physician for advice. The physician said, “Since your teacher is omniscient, he himself must know.” When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “There are five kinds of collyrium: collyrium derived from flowers, collyrium in a liquid state, collyrium in powder form, collyrium in pill form, and collyrium derived from red ocher.”</p>
<p>The monk recovered his health with the collyrium. Since he left the remains of the collyrium in many different places, the remains were lost. Later, another monk had an eye disease and also went to the physician, and the physician also prescribed the same collyrium for him. The second monk went to the first monk and said, “Venerable one, I also have an eye disease.  Are there any remains of the collyrium?”</p>
<p>The first monk looked for the remains of the collyrium, but could not find them. He said, “Venerable one, indeed there were remains of the collyrium, but they have been lost because I left them in many different places.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks should not leave collyrium in many different places. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for a monk who keeps collyrium. A monk who keeps collyrium should store the collyrium according to its kind. He should keep collyrium derived from flowers in a vessel, collyrium in a liquid state in a bottle, and collyrium in powder form in a tubular vessel. He should put collyrium in pill form and collyrium derived from red ocher into bags, and he should bind and hang them on a peg in the wall. If a monk who keeps collyrium does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>V. A Man Gone Mad</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>At that time, the venerable Saikata, his mind agitated, went mad and wandered about. Then some brahmins and householders saw him and said, “Sirs, whose son is this?”</p>
<p>Others replied, “The householder So-and-so’s.”</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders said, “If the venerable Saikata had not gone forth among the masterless śramaṇas, who are the sons of the Śākyans, his kinsmen would have cured him.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, then cure the monk Saikata, asking a physician for advice.”</p>
<p>The monks went to a physician and said, “Sir, since a monk has a disease like this, prescribe medicine for him.”</p>
<p>“Noble ones,” said the physician, “let him eat raw meat and he will recover his health.”</p>
<p>“Sir,  what is he? A cannibal?”</p>
<p>“Noble ones, this is his medicine. He cannot recover his health with other medicines.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If the physician says, ‘This is his medicine. He cannot recover his health with other medicines,’ you should give him raw meat.”</p>
<p>The monks gave the venerable Saikata raw meat, but he could not eat the raw meat. The Blessed One said, “You should give him the meat after covering his eyes with a cloth.”</p>
<p>They gave the venerable Saikata raw meat and untied the cloth soon after giving him the raw meat. Then the venerable Saikata saw his hands soiled with raw meat and vomited in revulsion. The Blessed One said, “You should not untie the cloth that soon, but should untie it when you have placed a pure and fine meal before him and he has washed his hands.”</p>
<p>After the health of the venerable Saikata returned, he wanted to eat nothing but raw meat. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “When you have your health back, you should act in accordance with the established discipline. If you eat raw meat, you become guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>VI. Pilinda</p>
<p>The following took place in Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>The venerable Pilindavatsa had always had many illnesses and pains since he had gone forth. The monks asked him, “Elder, how do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Venerables, I always have many illnesses and pains. I cannot bear them,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Elder, what did you carry with you formerly?”</p>
<p>He said, “I carried a medicine bag.”</p>
<p>“Why do you not carry it now?”</p>
<p>“The Blessed One has not authorized it.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, on account of that, I authorize monks to carry a medicine bag.”</p>
<p>When the monks put unprocessed medicines derived from roots, flowers, stalks, and fruits into the bag, the medicines spoiled. The Blessed One said, “You should gather or bundle the medicines together and hang them on a peg.”</p>
<p>The medicines spoiled and the Blessed One said, “From time to time you should dry them.”</p>
<p>When dried in the sun, the medicines lost their efficacy. The Blessed One said, “You should not dry them in the sun.”</p>
<p>When dried in the shade, the medicines spoiled. The Blessed One said, “You should not dry them in the shade.”</p>
<p>When the monks spread the medicines out and left them, the wind and rain came, but the monks did not bring the medicines inside. The Blessed One said, “You should bring the medicines inside.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One said, “You should bring the medicines inside,” the monks did not know who should bring them inside. The Blessed One said, “A layman should. If there are no laymen, a novice should. If there are no novices, a monk should bring the medicines inside.”</p>
<p>When the monks had brought the medicines inside, they did not consume them, since the medicines had become mixed together. The Blessed One said, “You should consume the medicines after separating them. You should not have any regrets about consuming such medicines. What I have authorized for illnesses should not be done in ordinary circumstances. If you do so, you become guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>VII. Revata</p>
<p>A. Rice Flour and Guḍa</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>The venerable Revata used to doubt everything. Therefore, he was known by the name of “Revata the Doubter”. Early in the morning he dressed, took his robe and his bowl, and entered Śrāvastī for alms. In due course he reached the house of a guḍa maker. When he saw that the guḍa was being kneaded with rice flour, he said, “Sir, please don’t knead the guḍa with rice flour.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” asked the guḍa maker, “do you know anything else that makes guḍa bind together?”</p>
<p>“I do not know anything else that makes guḍa bind together,  but we have to eat guḍa even at inappropriate times.”</p>
<p>The guḍa maker said, “Noble one, whether you eat it at the appropriate time or at inappropriate times, what makes guḍa bind together is this rice flour. Other things do not work.”</p>
<p>Later, when the community had obtained some guḍakhādanika, the venerable Revata did not eat it. His co-resident monks and pupils said, “Master, since the community has obtained some guḍakhādanika, please eat it.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” replied the venerable Revata, “it is mixed with food to be eaten only at the appropriate time.”</p>
<p>They did not eat the guḍakhādanika either, and other monks said to them, “Venerables, though the community has guḍakhādanika, why do you not eat any?”</p>
<p>“Our teacher said, ‘This is mixed with food,’ ” replied the first monks.</p>
<p>They did not eat the guḍakhādanika, either. Their many followers and most of the entire community did not eat the guḍakhādanika.</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You may eat the guḍakhādanika mixed with rice flour because it would be insubstantial as a meal and its origin is pure. You should not have any regrets about eating the guḍakhādanika.”</p>
<p>B. Barley Flour and Guḍa</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the venerable Revata dressed, took his robe and his bowl, and entered Śrāvastī for alms. In due course he reached a village and saw a perfumer touch guḍa after he had touched barley flour. The venerable Revata said, “Sir, please don’t touch guḍa after you touch barley flour. We have to eat guḍa even at inappropriate times.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the perfumer, “is there anyone to hand me water to wash my hands again and again?”</p>
<p>Later, the community had obtained some guḍakhādanīya, but the venerable Revata did not eat it. His co-resident monks and pupils said, “Master, though the community has guḍakhādanīya, why do you not eat any?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” replied the venerable Revata, “this is mixed with food to be eaten only at the appropriate time.”</p>
<p>They  did not eat the guḍakhādanīya either, and other monks said to them, “Venerables, though the community has guḍakhādanīya, why do you not eat any?”</p>
<p>“Our teacher said, ‘This is mixed with food,’ ” the first monks replied.</p>
<p>They did not eat the guḍakhādanīya, either. Their many followers and most of the entire community did not eat the guḍakhādanīya.</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You may eat the guḍakhādanīya mixed with barley flour because it would be insubstantial as a meal and its origin is pure. You should not have any regrets about eating the guḍakhādanīya.”</p>
<p>VIII. Sauvīraka</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>The venerable Śāriputra had a wind illness and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana thought, “Although I have attended to the venerable Śāriputra at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a physician for advice. Now I will ask a physician for advice.” The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana went to a physician and said, “Sir, since the venerable Śāriputra has a disease like this, prescribe medicine for him.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the physician, “let him eat sauvīraka with salt, and he will recover his health.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana found sauvīraka, but there was no salt. When he began to look for the salt, the venerable Pilindavatsa said, “Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, I have a horn in which the salt is kept. I have taken formal possession of that salt as medicine to be consumed throughout life. I will give you the salt if the Blessed One authorizes it.”</p>
<p>The venerable Śāriputra heard this and said, “Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, I thought that ‘medicines to be consumed throughout life cannot be consumed when they are mixed with medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time.’ ”</p>
<p>When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Maudgalyāyana, such medicines cannot be taken. If the four kinds of medicines—medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time, medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days,  and medicines to be consumed throughout life—are mixed with medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time, and if formal possession of these medicines has not been taken, these medicines should be consumed at the appropriate time, because they are mixed with medicines to be consumed at the appropriate time. These medicines should not be consumed after the appropriate time.</p>
<p>“If the three kinds of medicines—medicines to be consumed at night, medicines to be consumed within seven days, and medicines to be consumed throughout life—are mixed with medicines to be consumed at night, and if formal possession of these medicines has not been taken, these medicines should be consumed during the night, because they are mixed with medicines to be consumed at night. These medicines should not be consumed after that night.</p>
<p>“If the two kinds of medicines—medicines to be consumed within seven days and medicines to be consumed throughout life—are mixed with medicines to be consumed within seven days, these medicines should be consumed within seven days, because they are mixed with medicines to be consumed within seven days. These medicines should not be consumed after seven days.</p>
<p>“Medicines to be consumed throughout life may be consumed throughout life. If you consume the medicines in other ways, you become guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>Chapter Two</p>
<p>Summary of Contents:</p>
<p>Mahāsenā, Flesh, Hemorrhoids,</p>
<p>One Who Has a Wind Illness, Pūrṇa,</p>
<p>Agnidatta, be’i ra to,</p>
<p>One Who Has Clouds, and Crows.</p>
<p>I. Mahāsenā</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once traveling through the country of Kāśi and arrived in Vārāṇasī. He stayed in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana near Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>A householder named Mahāsena was living in Vārāṇasī. He was rich and had great wealth and many possessions. His wife’s name was Mahāsenā. Both he and his wife were pious and good and had virtuous dispositions. Mahāsena heard that the Buddha, the Blessed One, had arrived in Vārāṇasī, having traveled through the country of Kāśi, and that he was staying in the Deer Park at Ṛṣivadana near Vārāṇasī. When Mahāsena heard that, he thought, “Although the Blessed One has been invited to my house many times and has had meals, he has never been offered all the requisites. Now I will offer the Blessed One all the requisites for three months.”</p>
<p>He went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted him in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then the householder Mahāsena praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for three months: namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the householder Mahāsena by remaining silent. The householder Mahāsena again praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>The Blessed One together with the community of monks was then provided by the householder Mahāsena with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, for three months. The householder Mahāsena always rose at dawn, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and visited the monks. There was a monk who was ill, seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness.  The physician told him, “Drink meat broth.” At that time, the householder Mahāsena went to that monk. When Mahāsena arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the monk, and he asked, “Noble one, what did the physician prescribe for you?”</p>
<p>“The physician said to drink meat broth,” replied the sick monk.</p>
<p>Then the householder Mahāsena went to his own house and said to his wife, “Since the physician told Master So-and-so to drink meat broth, prepare it and give it to him.”</p>
<p>The householder Mahāsena’s wife handed money to a girl and sent her to the market. However, the king’s son was born on that day, and the following prohibition was proclaimed with the ringing of bells: “Nobody may kill beings. Whoever kills any living being will be severely punished.” Therefore, the girl could not get meat in the market even with the money.</p>
<p>When the girl reported this matter in detail to the householder Mahāsena, the householder Mahāsena’s wife thought, “Since we have offered the community of monks headed by the Buddha all the requisites, it would not be good if a monk dies because of a lack of medicine.” She took a sharp knife, entered the house, cut off some flesh from her thigh, handed it to the girl, and said, “Girl, make broth from this flesh and take it to the noble one So-and-so.”</p>
<p>The girl took the broth to him, and the monk consumed the broth and recovered his health.  The monk knew that the householder’s wife had served him with her own flesh in that way and thought, “It is not appropriate for me to be lying down after consuming what was given with faith. Now I will exert myself in order to attain what I have not attained, realize what I have not realized, and actualize what I have not actualized.” He then became diligent.  Exerting himself, endeavoring and striving, he came to understand saṃsāra’s ever-revolving five cycles;  overthrew all conditioned states by nature subject to degradation, decline, dispersal, and destruction; abandoned all defilements; realized the state of an arhat; and became an arhat. He was free from desire for the three realms—one for whom a lump of dirt was equal to gold, for whom space was equal to the palm of his hand, who accepted being cut by an adze and being anointed with sandal paste as the same, and whose knowledge had shattered the eggshell of ignorance. He attained knowledge, supernormal knowledge, and discerning wisdom; he turned his back on worldly profit, desires, and honors; and he became an object of veneration, respect, and praise for the gods including Indra and Upendra.</p>
<p>There is nothing, even in the slightest, that the buddhas, the blessed ones, do not know, see, comprehend, or understand. Early the next morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the house of the householder Mahāsena, followed by the community of monks. When the Blessed One arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the householder Mahāsena, “Householder, the householder’s wife Mahāsenā is nowhere to be seen. Where is she?”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, she is in the innermost apartment because she cannot move.”</p>
<p>The majesty of the buddhas, the blessed ones, is inconceivable. The Blessed One exercised his magical power so that her wound healed and her own color, skin, and hair returned. Faith then having arisen in the householder Mahāsena’s wife, she appeared at the door and touched the Blessed One’s feet.  The Blessed One asked, “Why has this householder’s wife experienced the power of a bodhisattva?”</p>
<p>She spoke this verse in reply:</p>
<p>“In saṃsāra, with no effort</p>
<p>A body is exceedingly easy to attain.</p>
<p>But even during ten billion eons,</p>
<p>It is exceedingly difficult to meet a person worthy of gifts.”</p>
<p>The householder Mahāsena then knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When, with his own hands, he had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, and knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the householder took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena. After having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Mahāsena in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One went to the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, human flesh is the worst of all kinds of flesh. Therefore, monks should not eat human flesh. If a monk eats human flesh, he becomes guilty of a sthūlātyaya offense. I will now establish rules of customary behavior for an elder monk of the community.  If flesh is offered, an elder monk of the community should ask, ‘What flesh is this?’ If the elder monk of the community cannot, the second elder monk should ask. If the elder monk of the community does not act in accordance with the established rules of customary behavior, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>All of the monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that the householder Mahāsena’s wife served this monk with her own flesh, and, in dependence upon Mahāsenā, this monk abandoned all the defilements and actualized the state of an arhat?”</p>
<p>“Listen well, monks,” the Blessed One replied, “and bear in mind how, not only in the present but also in the past, she served this monk with her own flesh, and how this monk actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge. I will tell you about it.</p>
<p>“A long time ago, monks, there was a householder named Mahāsena who lived in Vārāṇasī, and his wife’s name was Mahāsenā. At that time, a brahmin schoolteacher was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred sons of brahmins. Faith in the brahmin having arisen in the householder Mahāsena, he offered all the requisites to him and his attendants. The householder Mahāsena honored the brahmin and his attendants.</p>
<p>“The householder always used to rise at dawn and look after the sick. A young brahmin then became seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness. The physician told him, ‘Drink meat broth.’ Then the householder Mahāsena went to the young brahmin. When he arrived, he bowed and asked, ‘Young brahmin, what did the physician prescribe for you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘The physician told me to drink meat broth,’ the young brahmin replied.</p>
<p>“Then the householder Mahāsena  went to his own house and said to his wife, ‘Since the physician told the young brahmin So-and-so to drink meat broth, prepare it and give it to him.’</p>
<p>“The householder Mahāsena’s wife handed money to a girl and sent her to the market. However, the king’s son was born on that day, and the following prohibition was proclaimed with the ringing of bells: ‘Nobody may kill beings. Whoever kills any being will be severely punished.’ Therefore, the girl could not get meat in the market even with the money.</p>
<p>“When the girl reported this matter in detail to the householder Mahāsena’s wife, the householder Mahāsena’s wife thought, ‘Since we have offered this brahmin and his attendants all the requisites, it would not be good if a young brahmin dies because of a lack of medicine.’ She took a sharp knife, entered the house, cut off some flesh from her thigh, handed it to the girl, and said, ‘Girl, make broth from this flesh and take it to the young brahmin So-and-so.’</p>
<p>“The girl took it to him and the young brahmin consumed it and recovered his health. The young brahmin knew that the householder’s wife had served him with her own flesh in that way and thought, ‘It is not appropriate for me to be lying down after consuming what was given with faith. Now I will endeavor to attain what I have not attained, realize what I have not realized, and actualize what I have not actualized.’ He then went to a quiet place and actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who was the householder Mahāsena’s wife at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this householder Mahāsena’s wife. The one who was the young brahmin at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk. She then served this monk with her own flesh and he, in dependence upon her, actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.  Now, too, she served this monk with her own flesh, and this monk, in dependence upon her, abandoned all defilements and actualized the state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative; the maturation of entirely positive actions is entirely positive; the maturation of those that are mixed is mixed. Therefore, monks, henceforth you should abandon entirely negative and mixed actions, and you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>II. Flesh</p>
<p>A. Elephant Flesh</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>At a certain time all the elephants of King Prasenajit of Kosala had died. Since a famine had broken out, brahmins and householders started to eat elephant flesh. Early in the morning, the group of six monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and entered Śrāvastī for alms. When they entered a house where a householder was cooking elephant flesh in a pot, the householder’s wife said, “Noble ones, we have nothing to offer you. Please leave.”</p>
<p>“Is there something cooking in this pot?” asked the monks.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, this is elephant flesh. Do you eat elephant flesh?”</p>
<p>“Our lives depend on you. If you eat it, please give it to us, too.”</p>
<p>She then offered the elephant flesh to them. When they had gone out with their bowls full, they were seen by the other monks who were going for alms. When the other monks saw the group of six monks, they asked them, “O group of six, if your bowls are full, what’s in them?”</p>
<p>“We have some elephant flesh,” they replied.</p>
<p>“Do you eat elephant flesh?”</p>
<p>“Venerables, a famine has broken out. If we cannot get anything else, should we die of hunger?”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, since all the king’s elephants have died, if the king hears that you ate elephant flesh, will he not think, ‘Because the noble ones eat elephant flesh, my elephants have died,’ because there are gods, nāgas, humans, and other nonhuman creatures who have faith in you? Monks should not eat elephant flesh. If a monk eats elephant flesh, he becomes guilty of an offense. Horse flesh is the same as elephant flesh.”</p>
<p>B. Nāga Flesh</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once staying on the bank of Ṛṣi Gargā Pond in the country of Campā.</p>
<p>The nāga of Campā was pious and good and had a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he left his abode, practiced the eightfold abstinence, illuminated the place, expanded his body, and gave it to others. He never harmed or frightened any beings in the world.</p>
<p>Since a famine had broken out, people who had lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, started to cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the group of six monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and entered the town for alms. When they entered a house where a householder was cooking nāga flesh in a pot, the householder’s wife said, “Noble ones, we have nothing to offer you. Please leave.”</p>
<p>“Is there something cooking in this pot?” asked the monks.</p>
<p>“Noble ones, this is nāga flesh. Do you eat nāga flesh?”</p>
<p>“Our lives  depend on you. If you eat it, please give it to us, too.”</p>
<p>She then offered the nāga flesh to them. Most of the other people then started to eat nāga flesh too, thinking, “Even the noble ones eat it.” At that time, the wife of the nāga of Campā thought, “Because even these noble ones eat nāga flesh, most people now eat it too. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? I will ask the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Then the wife of the nāga of Campā, after the first watch of that night, went to the Blessed One, showing her noble figure. When she arrived, she bowed down until her forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then she sat down to one side. At that time, the figure of the wife of the nāga of Campā radiated light, the vast splendor of which filled the entire neighborhood of Ṛṣi Gargā Pond. After she sat down, the wife of the nāga of Campā said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, my husband is pious and good and has a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he leaves his abode, practices the eightfold abstinence, and gives his body to others. He never harms or frightens any beings in the world. Since a famine has broken out, people who have lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them. The noble ones saw this and they too started to eat the flesh. Because the noble ones eat it, most people have also started to cut it off and eat it. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? Alas, Blessed One, please have compassion and devise some reason for the noble ones to resolve not to eat nāga flesh.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the wife of the nāga of Campā by remaining silent. The wife of the nāga of Campā, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed down until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet and then disappeared from that very place. Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, last night the wife of the nāga of Campā came to me after the first watch of the night, showing her noble figure. When she arrived, she bowed down until her forehead touched my feet, and then she sat down to one side. At that time, the figure of the wife of the nāga of Campā radiated light, the vast splendor of which filled the entire neighborhood of Ṛṣi Gargā Pond. After she had sat down, the wife of the Nāga of Campā said to me, ‘Honored One, my husband is pious and good and has a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth days of every month, he leaves his abode, practices the eightfold abstinence, and gives his body to others. He never harms or frightens any beings in the world. Since a famine has broken out, people who have lost their livelihoods, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people making a living properly, and people making a living improperly, cut off pieces of the nāga’s flesh and eat them. When they began to eat the flesh, the noble ones also started to eat it. Because the noble ones also eat the flesh, most people have also started to cut it off and eat it too. How long does my husband have to bear his pain? Alas, Blessed One, please have compassion and devise some reason for the noble ones to resolve not to eat nāga flesh.’  I assented to the wife of the nāga of Campā by remaining silent, and the wife of the nāga of Campā, knowing that I had assented by remaining silent, bowed down until her forehead touched my feet and then disappeared from that very place. Now the gods also criticize, insult, and disparage the monks who ate the nāga flesh, saying, ‘Those monks, the sons of the Śākyans, have fallen away from the virtuous dharmas.’ This incident is not good, not appropriate. Therefore, monks, monks should not eat nāga flesh. If a monk eats nāga flesh, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>III. Hemorrhoids</p>
<p>The Blessed One was once traveling through the country of Magadha and arrived at Rājagṛha. He stayed in Kalandaka­nivāpa Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>When King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard that the Buddha, the Blessed One, was traveling through the country of Magadha, had arrived at Rājagṛha, and was staying in Kalandaka­nivāpa Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha, he thought, “Although I have invited the Blessed One many times and the Blessed One has had meals, he has never been offered all the requisites for three months. Now I will offer the Blessed One all the requisites for three months, and I will also send Jīvaka, the chief physician.”</p>
<p>The king went to the Blessed One displaying royal treasures and great royal power. When the king arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha.  After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the king in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha by remaining silent. King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. The Blessed One together with the community of monks was provided by King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha with all the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months.</p>
<p>When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the Blessed One together with the community of disciples had been provided by King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha with all the requisites, along with Jīvaka, the chief physician, for three months, he thought, “He is an anointed kṣatriya king, and I am also an anointed kṣatriya king. His chief physician is Jīvaka, and my chief physician is Ātreya. So, I will offer the Blessed One together with the community of disciples all the requisites, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, when the Blessed One comes to Śrāvastī.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One stayed at Rājagṛha during the rainy season. When the three months of the rainy season had passed, he finished mending his robes, took his bowl and his robe, and traveled through the country toward Śrāvastī, surrounded by a group of monks and followed by the community of monks. In due course, the Blessed One, traveling through the country, arrived in Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, had arrived in Śrāvastī and was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī, he left Śrāvastī and went to the Blessed One. When the king arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Prasenajit of Kosala. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted him in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said,  “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, for three months.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to King Prasenajit of Kosala by remaining silent. King Prasenajit of Kosala, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed down until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. The Blessed One together with the community of monks was provided by King Prasenajit of Kosala with all the requisites, along with Ātreya, the chief physician, for three months.</p>
<p>King Prasenajit of Kosala always rose at dawn, bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and visited the sick monks.</p>
<p>At that time, a monk had hemorrhoids and turned pale, became emaciated, lost his strength, and was weakened. King Prasenajit of Kosala saw him and asked, “Noble one, why have you turned pale, become emaciated, lost your strength, and been weakened?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I have hemorrhoids,” answered the monk.</p>
<p>The king then ordered Ātreya, the chief physician, “Treat this monk.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” Ātreya replied.</p>
<p>Because Ātreya was impious, he did not treat the monk. Later, the king saw the monk again and asked him, “Noble one, were you not treated by Ātreya?”</p>
<p>“I was not, Your Majesty,” answered the monk.</p>
<p>Then the king became enraged. He summoned Ātreya by messenger and warned, “If you treat this monk, all will be fine. But if you do not, I will curtail your allotment.”</p>
<p>Ātreya, who was naturally impious, himself became very angry and thought,  “His Majesty will curtail my allotment because of this shaven-headed śramaṇa.” Ātreya tied the monk up at the gate of the Jetavana and began surgery. The monk, growing afraid, fearful, and hurt, and experiencing acute, intolerable, and unpleasant pain, wondered to himself, “Does the Blessed One not observe me afraid, fearful, and hurt?”</p>
<p>There is nothing, even in the slightest, that the buddhas, the blessed ones, do not know, see, comprehend, or understand. When the Blessed One, spurred by great compassion, went there, Ātreya, the chief physician, saw the Blessed One arrive. Upon seeing him, Ātreya, fiercely angry, called out to the Blessed One, “Come here, śramaṇa, son of a slave woman—look at your disciple’s anus cut open!”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One left, returned to the monastery, and sat on the seat prepared for him. When he had sat down, the Blessed One smiled.</p>
<p>It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile, rays of blue, yellow, red, and white light emanate from their mouths. Some of the rays stream downward and some stream upward.</p>
<p>Those rays that stream downward go to the hells of Reviving, Black Cord, Being Crushed, Scream, Great Scream, Heat, Intense Heat, Incessant, Blisters, Burst Blisters, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Water Lily, Lotus, and Great Lotus. They alight on and cool those in the hot hells and alight on and warm those in the cold hells.  Thus, each of the various pains of those beings in hell ceases. When those beings think, “Sirs, have we died here and been reborn elsewhere?” the blessed ones send an emanation to engender their faith. Seeing it, they think, “Sirs, we have not died here and been reborn elsewhere. Each of our various pains ceased on account of the power of this being we have never seen before.” Their minds filled with faith in the emanation, they exhaust the karma that led them to experience the hells and are reborn among gods and humans as vessels for seeing the truths.</p>
<p>Those rays that stream upward go to the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, the gods of Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin, the gods attendant on Brahmā, and the gods of Brahma­purohita, Mahābrahman, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, Ābhāsvara, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, Śubhakṛtsna, Anabhraka, Puṇyaprasava, Bṛhatphala, Abṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha. They resonate with the words “impermanent,” “subject to suffering,” “empty,” and “selfless,” and they proclaim these two verses:</p>
<p>“Take action! Go forth!</p>
<p>Apply yourself to the Buddha’s teachings!</p>
<p>As an elephant destroys a house made of reeds,</p>
<p>Destroy the army of Death!</p>
<p>“Those who, with great care,</p>
<p>Exert themselves in this Dharma and Vinaya</p>
<p>Abandon the course of rebirth</p>
<p>And bring an end to suffering!”</p>
<p>Then the rays of light,  after unfurling through the worlds of the great billionfold universe, later return to the Blessed One. The rays disappear into the space behind the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain actions of the past. They disappear into the space in front of the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain the future. They disappear into the soles of his feet when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth in the hells. They disappear into his heels when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as an animal. They disappear into his big toe when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a hungry ghost. They disappear into his knees when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a human. They disappear into his left palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king of power. They disappear into his right palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king. They disappear into his navel when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a god. They disappear into his mouth when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a disciple. They disappear into the circle of hair between his eyebrows when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a self-awakened one. They disappear into the crown of his head when the Blessed One intends to explain complete and perfect awakening.</p>
<p>The rays of light then circled the Blessed One three times and disappeared into the soles of his feet.The venerable Ānanda made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said:</p>
<p>“A mass made brilliant by thousands of colors</p>
<p>Came forth from your mouth,</p>
<p>Like the sun rising,</p>
<p>Shining in every direction.”</p>
<p>And Ānanda then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“One who has become a buddha, the supreme cause in the world,</p>
<p>Free from restlessness, discouragement, and self-satisfaction,</p>
<p>A victor who has subdued enemies—</p>
<p>Not without cause does he flash a smile,</p>
<p>White like a lotus root or a conch shell.</p>
<p>“Therefore, O resolute one, please know when the time is right,</p>
<p>O lord of victors, supreme Muni,</p>
<p>And resolve the doubts of your listeners who desire to hear</p>
<p>With words that are reliable, sublime, and excellent.</p>
<p>“Protectors, perfectly awakened ones,</p>
<p>Who are steady like the mountains in the middle of the ocean,</p>
<p>Do not smile accidentally.</p>
<p>These many people desire to hear</p>
<p>For what reason the resolute one smiles.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “that is exactly it! Tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause or condition. Ānanda, Ātreya, the chief physician, is degenerate and will meet an untimely end. He said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the Tathāgata, who has had no fault in his conduct since he assumed Mahāsammata’s lineage. In seven days Ātreya will die, vomiting blood. With the destruction of his body, he will be reborn among the hell beings. Therefore, monks, you should not treat Ātreya or others like Ātreya with respect. You should not surgically remove hemorrhoids. Treatment for hemorrhoids should be done in two ways: mantras and medicines. If a monk surgically removes hemorrhoids or treats Ātreya or others like Ātreya with respect, the monk becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>The monk died from the particular harm done by Ātreya. The ministers reported to King Prasenajit, “Your Majesty, Ātreya said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the Blessed One and that monk died of the particular harm done by Ātreya.”</p>
<p>The king was then very much enraged and shouted to his ministers, “Sirs, I have renounced Ātreya, the chief physician.  Go!”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” said the ministers, “why would you want to kill he who is already dead? The Blessed One predicted, ‘In seven days he will die, vomiting blood. With the destruction of his body, he will be reborn among the hell beings.’ ”</p>
<p>“Then banish him from my country,” ordered the king.</p>
<p>The ministers banished Ātreya and he went to a country called Sāketā. The gods living in Sāketā greatly reviled him: “You stupid man, why should you who has said ‘son of a slave woman’ to the protector of the three realms stay here?” And so they expelled Ātreya. Then he went to Vārāṇasī. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Vaiśālī. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Campā. Then, having been expelled from there, he went to Rājagṛha. Then, having been expelled from there, he dwelt under a tree. Then, having been expelled from there by the gods living in the tree, Ātreya went to the shores of a river, a lake, and a pond. Even there he could not find an opportunity to stay and thought, “Although even foxes find opportunities to stay on this continent of Jambu, I have nowhere to stay even under a tree, at a lake, or at a pond.” Then, the fierce agony arose for him in which one dies vomiting blood. As soon as he died, he was reborn in the great hell of Incessant.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One spoke these verses about that incident:</p>
<p>“Words, like an axe, hurtle forth from the mouth</p>
<p>Of a person who has been reborn.</p>
<p>Those who speak ill</p>
<p>Cut themselves with the words they say.</p>
<p>“Those who praise those who are worthy of reproach</p>
<p>And reproach those who are worthy of praise</p>
<p>Offend with the mouth,</p>
<p>Because of which they fail to obtain happiness.</p>
<p>“The loss of one who, in this world,</p>
<p>Loses his own wealth by gambling is small.</p>
<p>The loss of one who</p>
<p>Thinks ill of the sugatas is great.</p>
<p>“After reproaching the noble ones and, with body and speech,</p>
<p>Doing evil, he will go to the hell of Burst Blisters</p>
<p>And stay there for one hundred thousand years. Then he will go to the hell of Blisters</p>
<p>And stay there for forty-one thousand years.”</p>
<p>IV. One Who Has a Wind Illness</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once traveling through the country of Kāśi and stayed overnight in a town where the boundary had not been fixed. There the Blessed One caught a wind illness. The venerable Ānanda thought, “Although I have attended to the Blessed One at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a physician for advice. Now I will ask a physician for advice.” He went to a physician and said, “Sir, since the Blessed One has a disease like this, prescribe medicine for him.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” said the physician, “have him eat the three spices boiled with a good amount of ghee, and he will recover his health.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda himself prepared and cooked the food and offered it to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, what is this?”</p>
<p>Ānanda said, “Honored One, I thought, ‘Although I have attended to the Blessed One at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a physician for advice. Now I will ask a physician for advice.’ When I consulted a physician, he said, ‘Noble one, have him eat the three spices boiled with a good amount of ghee, and he will recover his health.’ So I myself prepared and cooked it.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, where did you make it?”</p>
<p>“Within the boundary.”</p>
<p>“Where did you put it?”</p>
<p>“Within the boundary.”</p>
<p>“Who cooked it?”</p>
<p>“I did,  within the boundary.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, what was cooked within the boundary and was left within the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked within the boundary and was left outside the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked outside the boundary and was left within the boundary should not be eaten. What was cooked outside the boundary and was left outside the boundary may be eaten. Ānanda, what was cooked by a monk, whether within the boundary or outside the boundary, should not be eaten in any situation.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One concluded, “What was cooked by a monk should not be eaten in any situation.”</p>
<p>A householder living in Śrāvastī went to the Blessed One. When the householder arrived, he bowed down until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder. After he had . . . delighted him in a variety of ways . . . the Blessed One remained silent.  Then the householder rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” . . . Then the householder let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>Early in the morning the community of monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and  went to the house of the householder. The Blessed One refrained from going for almsfood.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the blessed ones, refrain from going for almsfood for five reasons. What are the five? Wishing to look after the sick, wishing to look after the living quarters, wishing to go into seclusion, wishing to teach the Dharma to the gods, and wishing to establish a rule of training in the Vinaya for the disciples. In this case, the Blessed One refrained from going for almsfood because he wished to establish a rule of training in the Vinaya for the disciples.</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda was in charge of receiving almsfood for the Blessed One. He was there given boiled rice, which was not fully cooked, and he thought, “It has not been long since the Blessed One recovered, and this rice is not fully cooked. So, if he has this rice, his illness may return. Although the Blessed One has not authorized cooking such food, it is probable that this situation will lead him to authorize cooking it.” Ānanda took a pitcher, poured water into the boiled rice, and cooked it until it was done. Then he offered the boiled rice to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The buddhas, the blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, does the entire community have the same boiled rice as this?”</p>
<p>“No, they do not, Honored One. Theirs is not fully cooked.”</p>
<p>“Then where did it come from?”</p>
<p>When Ānanda related to the Blessed One in detail what had happened, the Blessed One said, “Good, good, Ānanda!  You know even what I have not authorized. On account of that, I authorize monks to receive boiled rice that is not fully cooked and to cook and eat it.”</p>
<p>After the Blessed One said “monks may receive boiled rice that is not fully cooked and cook and eat it,” the group of six monks received raw rice and began to cook and eat it.</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You may receive, cook, and eat boiled rice, one third of which is cooked. You may receive and eat vegetables, flowers, fruits, fish, and meat after their color changes. You may receive, boil, and drink liquids such as milk when they have been boiled two or three times. You should not have any regrets about consuming such things. If you consume them in other ways, you become guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>V. Pūrṇa</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada.</p>
<p>At that time a householder named Bhava was living in a city called Sūrpāraka. He was rich and had great wealth and many possessions, with holdings both vast and extensive. He possessed wealth equal to that of Vaiśravaṇa, rivaling that of Vaiśravaṇa. Bhava took a wife from a family of equal rank, and Bhava and his wife played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, and thus the wife conceived a child. After eight or nine months, a boy who was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold was born. At the birth, the householder held a great celebration for twenty-one days and, to give the baby a name, he asked, “What name shall we give this boy?”</p>
<p>His kinsmen  suggested, “Since this boy is the son of the householder Bhava, let us name him Bhavila.” Thus the boy was named Bhavila.</p>
<p>Then the couple again played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, and another boy was born and named Bhavatrāta.</p>
<p>And then again a boy was born to the householder and was named Bhavanandin.</p>
<p>Later, the householder Bhava caught an illness and spoke very harsh words, and thus his wife and sons abandoned him. He had a servant girl, and she thought, “Although my master won possessions through hundreds of thousands of means, he now has an illness and was abandoned even by his wife and sons. If I give up on my master, that would not be appropriate for me.”</p>
<p>She went to a physician and asked, “Master, do you know the householder Bhava?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do. What happened to him?”</p>
<p>“He has such-and-such kind of illness, and he was abandoned by his wife and sons. Prescribe medicine for him.”</p>
<p>“You said he was abandoned by his wife and sons. Then who attends to him?” asked the physician.</p>
<p>“I attend to him. Please prescribe inexpensive medicine.”</p>
<p>The physician prescribed it, saying, “This is his medicine.”</p>
<p>Then the servant girl, taking some food for Bhava from her own provisions and also taking some from the house, attended to him, and he recovered his health. Bhava thought, “I was abandoned by my wife and sons and I owe my life to this girl. I should do something for her in return.” Bhava said to her, “Girl, I was abandoned by my wife and sons and I owe my life to you. So I will give you whatever you most want. Tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>“Master,  if you are satisfied with me, I would like to have sex with you.”</p>
<p>Bhava said, “What is the use of our having sex? I will give you five hundred kārṣāpaṇas and liberate you from servitude.”</p>
<p>“Master, I am nothing but a slave whether I am far from here or in the next life,” she replied. “If I have sex with you, Master, I am not a slave.”</p>
<p>Bhava, knowing she would insist, said, “Girl, tell me when the time is right and you are fertile.”</p>
<p>Later, when the time was right and she was fertile, she told him. Then the two, the householder Bhava and the servant girl, enjoyed themselves together, and she conceived a child. From the very day the child was conceived, all the wealth and all the business of the householder Bhava became abundant and fulfilled. After eight or nine months, a boy was born. He was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold, with a golden complexion, his head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete. From the time he was born, all the wealth and all the business of the householder Bhava again became abundant and fulfilled. At the birth, the householder held a great celebration for twenty-one days and, to give the baby a name, . . . “Let us name him Pūrṇa (Fulfilled).” Thus the boy was named Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>The boy Pūrṇa was entrusted to eight nursemaids: two nursemaids to change his diapers . . . (The passage should be recited in detail, up to:) He grew quickly like a lotus shooting up in a pond.  When Pūrṇa grew up, he was taught letters, calculation, numbers, counting by hand,  and how to deal with loans and two different types of deposits, and he became fully learned in eight kinds of analysis: the analysis of land, the analysis of cloth, the analysis of jewels, the analysis of wood, the analysis of elephants, the analysis of horses, the analysis of boys, and the analysis of girls. He also mastered other kinds of analysis and reading, and became one whose actions are clear.</p>
<p>Later, the householder Bhava made his sons get married one by one, beginning with Bhavila. The sons were so attached to their own wives that they abandoned the family business and settled down, smitten with physical beauty alone. Therefore, the householder Bhava was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. His sons noticed him and asked, “Father, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?”</p>
<p>“Sons,” he replied, “I did not get married until I had a hundred thousand pieces of gold. You have abandoned the family business and settled down, smitten with physical beauty alone. After my death, my family will be full of misery. How could I not be plunged into grief?”</p>
<p>Bhavila, taking off his jeweled earrings and putting on wooden earrings (dārukarṇikā), promised, “I will not put on jeweled earrings until I acquire a hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>The next one, putting on lac earrings (stavakarṇikā), made the same promise.</p>
<p>Then the third one, putting on lead earrings (trapukarṇikā), made the same promise too.</p>
<p>Although they had been known by the names Bhavila, Bhavatrāta, and Bhavanandin, those names disappeared, and they came to be known by the names Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin.</p>
<p>When the three sons took to the great ocean carrying merchandise, Pūrṇa said, “Father, I will take to the great ocean, too.”</p>
<p>His father replied, “Son,  because you are a child, you should stay here and do what needs to be done in the store.”</p>
<p>And so Pūrṇa stayed. His elder brothers returned, having been successful on their voyage. After they were fully rested, they said, “Father, please calculate the value of our merchandise.” Their father calculated the value and found that each of the three sons had acquired a hundred thousand pieces of gold.</p>
<p>Pūrṇa had also lawfully earned more than a hundred thousand pieces of gold. He threw himself at his father’s feet and said, “Father, please calculate the money I earned at the store, too.”</p>
<p>“Son, you have remained here,” replied his father. “What is there to calculate for you?”</p>
<p>“Father, at any rate, please calculate it and you will understand,” said Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>His father calculated it and found that there were, except for the capital, more than a hundred thousand pieces of gold obtained properly. The householder Bhava, being pleased and delighted, thought, “This creature appears to be one who has the great power of merit. Just remaining here, he has acquired a hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>Later, the householder Bhava caught an illness. He thought, “After my death, my sons will go their separate ways. So I must devise a plan to keep them together.” He said to them, “Sons, prepare firewood.” When the sons had prepared firewood, he said, “Kindle a fire.” When the sons had kindled a fire, he said, “Pull out, one by one, the pieces of wood.” When the sons had pulled out, one by one, the pieces of wood, the fire was extinguished. He asked, “Sons, did you see that?”</p>
<p>“We did, father,” said his sons.</p>
<p>Bhava then recited a verse:</p>
<p>“Fire burns when pieces of wood are gathered together.</p>
<p>Brothers together are just the same.</p>
<p>If you separate the pieces of wood, the fire is extinguished.</p>
<p>People are just like that.”</p>
<p>“Sons, after my death,  you should not listen to the words of women.</p>
<p>“Families are divided because of women.</p>
<p>Those who are clever are divided by words.</p>
<p>Mantras increase when they are badly chanted.</p>
<p>Friends are divided because of desire.”</p>
<p>The sons, except for Bhavila, went elsewhere. Bhavila stayed and his father said to him, “Son, whatever happens, you should not abandon Pūrṇa. He has the great power of merit.” Then Bhava passed away, saying:</p>
<p>“All accumulation ends in loss;</p>
<p>What is lofty in the end will fall;</p>
<p>All meetings end in separation;</p>
<p>All life ends in death.”</p>
<p>The sons decorated his bier with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth, performed a great ceremony, carried the body to the charnel ground, and cremated it. Then, having assuaged their grief, they said to one another, “When our father was alive, we depended on him for our livelihoods. But now he is dead. If we now abandon the family business and settle down, the family will dissolve and we will be reproached by our kinsmen. So let us go abroad carrying merchandise.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa said, “Then I will go, too.”</p>
<p>“You should stay here and do what needs to be done in the store,” said the brothers. “Only we three will go.” The three brothers then went abroad carrying merchandise. Pūrṇa, entrusted with all the other responsibilities, stayed behind.</p>
<p>It is commonplace that in a wealthy family each member of the family is given money for everyday expenses. The wives of the three elder brothers sent their female slaves to Pūrṇa to receive the money for everyday expenses. But since Pūrṇa was surrounded by merchants,  businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, the female slaves did not find an opportunity to receive the money for everyday expenses. After the guests had stood up and left, the female slaves were then given the money for that day. When the female slaves returned late, they were scolded: “Hey, girl, why are you so late?”</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa was surrounded by merchants, businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, and his brightness was blazing like the light of the sun,” they replied. “When everyone else had stood up and left, we were given the money.”</p>
<p>“Such a thing occurs when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house,” remarked the wives.</p>
<p>The wife of Bhavila asked her female slave, “Why are you so late?”</p>
<p>When the female slave had explained the matter in detail, the wife of Bhavila said, “Thank you. You should go when you know the time is right.”</p>
<p>Because the female slave knew when the time was right and went then, she quickly received the money. The other female slaves took a long time. They asked the first one, “How did you come back so quickly?”</p>
<p>She explained everything, and the other female slaves began to go to Pūrṇa with her. Pūrṇa was again surrounded by merchants, businessmen, caravan leaders, and servants, and when they left, he gave the female slave of Bhavila’s wife the day’s money. The other two female slaves also quickly obtained the money. Their mistresses asked, “How is it that you came back so quickly this time?”</p>
<p>They said, “May the eldest mistress be free from illness. When her female slave goes, Pūrṇa gives the money to her. So we go with her.”</p>
<p>Unable to bear it, the two wives again remarked,  “Such a thing occurs when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house.”</p>
<p>Later, Bhavila, Bhavatrāta, and Bhavanandin returned from the great ocean, joyfully, having succeeded on their voyage. Bhavila asked his wife, “Good lady, did Pūrṇa protect you well?”</p>
<p>“He was as good to me as a brother or a son,” she replied.</p>
<p>When the other two husbands asked their wives the same, the wives remarked yet again, “These are things that occur when sons of slave women come into power in someone’s house.”</p>
<p>The two brothers thought, “Women usually split friends apart.”</p>
<p>Later, immediately after the store of cloth from Kāśi was opened, Bhavila’s son came, and Pūrṇa dressed him with a piece of cloth from Kāśi. The wives of the two younger brothers saw the cloth and asked, “Child, who gave you this?”</p>
<p>“Uncle gave it to me,” answered the child.</p>
<p>Having seen such cloth, the other wives also sent their own sons. But, unfortunately for them, the store of cloth from Kāśi was closed and only the store of rough cloth was open, and so Pūrṇa dressed them in rough cloth. Seeing this, the wives of the two younger brothers complained to their husbands, “Did you see that? He gives cloth from Kāśi to one while he gives rough cloth to the others.”</p>
<p>The husbands answered, “That is definitely because when the boys arrived the store of cloth from Kāśi was closed, but the store of rough cloth was open.”</p>
<p>“Give it more thought,” said their wives.</p>
<p>Later, when the store of śarkarā was opened, Bhavila’s son came and got a bowl full of śarkarā.  When Bhavila’s son returned home carrying the śarkarā, the wives of the younger brothers saw him and asked, “Child, who gave you this?”</p>
<p>“Uncle gave it to me,” answered the child.</p>
<p>The two wives also sent their own sons. But unfortunately for them, the store of śarkarā was closed and only the store of guḍa was open. Since they came when only the store of guḍa was open, they got guḍa. “Did you see that?” the wives complained again. “Pūrṇa gives śarkarā to the one while he gives guḍa to the others.”</p>
<p>Having seen all that, the wives tried to alienate their husbands from one another in order to split up the household. The two younger brothers discussed the matter together: “Since our household has been ruined for good, we should divide it.”</p>
<p>One suggested, “Let’s call our eldest brother.”</p>
<p>The other replied, “For the time being, let’s consider how to divide the household ourselves.”</p>
<p>The two then considered it independently and thought, “One will take what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, another will take what there is in the store and what there is abroad, and the third will take Pūrṇa. If our eldest brother takes what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, we will be able to live on what there is in the store and what there is abroad. And if our eldest brother takes what there is in the store and what there is abroad, we will be able to live on what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, and we will also be able to torment Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>Thus the two brothers discussed the matter. They went to Bhavila and said, “Since our family relations have dissolved, we are going to divide the household.”</p>
<p>“I think we should do this after we have carefully analyzed the situation,” Bhavila replied, “because it is usually women who break up households.”</p>
<p>“We have already analyzed the situation,” said the other two,  “so we are going to divide the household.”</p>
<p>“Then call five arbitrators,” said Bhavila.</p>
<p>“Why do we need five arbitrators when we have already figured out the division of the household?” asked the two brothers. “One will take what there is in the house and what there is in the farm, another will take what there is in the store and what there is abroad, and the third will take Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>“Why do you not give Pūrṇa his share?” asked Bhavila.</p>
<p>“Who gives a share to the son of a slave woman?” the other two answered. “Not only that, he himself is one of the things we have apportioned. If you want Pūrṇa, take him.”</p>
<p>Bhavila thought, “Father ordered me: ‘You should not abandon Pūrṇa even if you part with your entire estate.’ So I should take Pūrṇa.” He then said, “If that is how it is, then I will provide for Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>The brother who took possession of what there was in the house and what there was in the farm went quickly to the house and called out, “Sister, get out of here!”</p>
<p>When Bhavila’s wife stepped out, he shouted, “Don’t come back again!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because we have divided what belongs to the household.”</p>
<p>The brother who took possession of what there was in the store and what there was abroad went quickly to the store and called out, “Pūrṇa, come down!”</p>
<p>When Pūrṇa came down, the brother said, “You cannot go up to the store anymore.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“We divided the household. What there is abroad and what there is in the store are mine.”</p>
<p>“Give me my share,” said Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>The brother retorted, “Why should we give a share to you, the son of a slave woman? Not only that, you yourself are one of the things we have apportioned. You have been taken by our eldest brother.”</p>
<p>When Bhavila’s wife went with Pūrṇa to the house of a kinsman, her children  began to cry from hunger. She implored him, “Pūrṇa, give my children something to eat.”</p>
<p>“Give me a kārṣāpaṇa,” said Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>“You earned a hundred thousand pieces of gold,” she replied. “Do you not have something for the children to eat?”</p>
<p>“How could I have known that your family would come to be needy like this?” said Pūrṇa in return. “If I had known that, I would have prepared hundreds of thousands of gold pieces.”</p>
<p>It is commonplace for women to carry a few brass coins wrapped in the hems of their garments. Bhavila’s wife gave Pūrṇa a brass coin and said, “Bring something to eat.”</p>
<p>Taking the coin with him, Pūrṇa went to the market, where he saw a man carrying a bundle of wood that had been cast ashore by the ocean waves. The man was shivering with cold, and Pūrṇa asked him, “Say, why are you shivering like this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” answered the man, “but I grow cold like this whenever I carry this bundle of wood even briefly.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa, who was learned in the analysis of wood, began to analyze the wood and found in it a piece of gośīrṣacandana. He asked the man, “Say, how much would you sell this for?”</p>
<p>“For five hundred kārṣāpaṇas.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa took the bundle of wood, extracted the piece of gośīrṣacandana, went to the market, sawed it into four pieces, sold just the sawdust for a thousand kārṣāpaṇas, and gave the man five hundred kārṣāpaṇas, saying, “Since Bhavila’s wife is staying at such-and-such a house, take this bundle of wood there and say that Pūrṇa sent it.”</p>
<p>When the man had brought the wood and told her what happened, Bhavila’s wife, beating her breast, cried out, “So did Pūrṇa also lose his mind after he lost his estate? I sent him to find something to be cooked.  Instead, he sent something to kindle a fire with, but nothing to be cooked!”</p>
<p>Later, the king of Sūrpāraka came down with a serious fever and was semiconscious. The physician prescribed gośīrṣacandana for him, and so the ministers began to look for gośīrṣacandana. They heard talk in the market and went to Pūrṇa. The ministers asked him, “Do you have gośīrṣacandana?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“How much would you sell it for?”</p>
<p>“For a thousand kārṣāpaṇas.”</p>
<p>The ministers bought the gośīrṣacandana for a thousand kārṣāpaṇas, and when they anointed the king with it, he recovered his health. The king thought, “What sort of house has gośīrṣacandana in it?” The king asked his ministers, “Where did this come from?”</p>
<p>“From Pūrṇa, Your Majesty,” answered the ministers.</p>
<p>“Call Pūrṇa here.”</p>
<p>A messenger went to Pūrṇa and told him, “Pūrṇa, His Majesty will speak with you.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa wondered, “Why would the king speak with me?” He then thought further, “Since he recovered his health on account of gośīrṣacandana, he would speak with me about gośīrṣacandana. So I should take all the gośīrṣacandana with me.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa wrapped three pieces of gośīrṣacandana with cloth, held another piece in his hand, and went to the king. The king asked, “Pūrṇa, do you have any gośīrṣacandana?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, here it is,” Pūrṇa answered.</p>
<p>“What is the price of this?”</p>
<p>“A hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any more?”</p>
<p>“I do, Your Majesty,” Pūrṇa said, showing him, one by one, the three other pieces of gośīrṣacandana. The king ordered his ministers, “Pay Pūrṇa four hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” said Pūrṇa, “give me three hundred thousand. I will present one to Your Majesty as a gift.”</p>
<p>The king gave three hundred thousand pieces of gold to Pūrṇa and said, “Pūrṇa, I am pleased with you.  So, tell me whatever you most want and I will give it to you.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, if you are pleased with me, I would ask to stay in your country without being harmed by anyone.”</p>
<p>The king ordered his ministers, “Sirs, from now on, you should not give orders to Pūrṇa even if you give orders to princes.”</p>
<p>Later, five hundred merchants came to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on their voyage on the great ocean. The guild of merchants in Sūrpāraka made a private agreement: “None of us should go alone to the foreign merchants. If someone goes alone, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed. We should gather our merchandise together.”</p>
<p>One of them said, “We should call Pūrṇa, too.”</p>
<p>“What is the use of calling that poor man?” asked another.</p>
<p>At that time Pūrṇa went out and heard that five hundred merchants had come to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on their voyage on the great ocean. Pūrṇa, without entering the city, went to the foreign merchants and asked, “Sirs, what are these goods?”</p>
<p>“They are this and that,” they answered.</p>
<p>“What is their price?”</p>
<p>“Caravan leader, wherever you go you only ask questions.”</p>
<p>“Even so, tell me the price,” Pūrṇa insisted.</p>
<p>The merchants priced the goods at one million, eight hundred thousand pieces of gold. Pūrṇa said, “Sirs, here are three hundred thousand pieces of gold for a deposit. This merchandise is mine. I will pay the balance when I get home.”</p>
<p>“Please do so,” they said, and Pūrṇa paid three hundred thousand pieces of gold as a deposit, placed his own seal on the merchandise, and departed.</p>
<p>Later, the guild of merchants sent servants, telling them, “Go see what goods there are.”</p>
<p>They went and asked, “What are these goods?”</p>
<p>“They are this and that.”</p>
<p>“Our  treasury and warehouse are full of such things.”</p>
<p>“Whether full or not, these goods have already been sold,” said the foreign merchants.</p>
<p>“To whom did you sell them?”</p>
<p>“To Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>“You must have made a great profit if you sold it to Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>The merchants said, “You would not pay even for full price what he paid as a deposit.”</p>
<p>“How much did he pay as a deposit?”</p>
<p>“Three hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>“He must have stolen the gold from his brothers.”</p>
<p>The servants went back and reported to the guild of merchants, “Those goods have already been sold.”</p>
<p>“To whom?”</p>
<p>“To Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>“They must have made a great profit if they sold it to Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>“You would not pay even for full price what he paid as a deposit.”</p>
<p>“How much did he pay as a deposit?”</p>
<p>“Three hundred thousand pieces of gold.”</p>
<p>“He must have stolen the gold from his brothers.”</p>
<p>They called Pūrṇa and said, “Pūrṇa, why did you take the merchandise when the guild of merchants had an agreement: ‘None should take the merchandise alone, but only the guild of merchants should take it’?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” he replied, “when you made the agreement, did you tell me or my brothers? You made the agreement without me. You alone should keep it.”</p>
<p>The guild of merchants then became angry. They seized Pūrṇa and placed him in the sun so that he would pay sixty kārṣāpanas. The king’s men witnessed this and told the king.</p>
<p>“Sirs, summon them,” ordered the king.</p>
<p>When the king’s men had summoned the merchants, the king asked them, “Sirs, why did you seize Pūrṇa and place him in the sun?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, we did so because the guild of merchants had an agreement that none should trade by themselves, but he engaged in trade by himself.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” said Pūrṇa, “please ask them whether they told me or my brothers when they made the agreement.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, Pūrṇa’s claim is fair,” said the king.</p>
<p>The merchants were ashamed, and they freed Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>Later, when the king needed an item, he summoned the guild of merchants and ordered them, “Sirs, since I need such-and-such an item, present it to me.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Pūrṇa has it,” they replied.</p>
<p>“Since I cannot order him,” said the king, “buy it from him and present it to me.”</p>
<p>The merchants sent a messenger to Pūrṇa, who told him, “The guild of merchants calls you.”</p>
<p>“I will not go,” answered Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>Then all the members of the guild of merchants assembled, went to Pūrṇa’s house, stood at the door, and sent him a message: “Pūrṇa, the guild of merchants is at your door. Come out!”</p>
<p>When Pūrṇa came out arrogantly, with pride and haughtiness, the guild of merchants said, “Caravan leader, please sell your merchandise at the price you paid for it.”</p>
<p>“If I sell my merchandise at the price I paid for it, I would surely be such a great merchant, wouldn’t I?” said Pūrṇa.</p>
<p>The merchants replied, “Sell it at twice the price and the guild of merchants will be honored.”</p>
<p>“The guild of merchants should be honored,” thought Pūrṇa. He then sold it at twice the price of one million, five hundred thousand.</p>
<p>After Pūrṇa hid the remaining money in his house, he thought, “How can I fill a vessel with dew drops? I will take to the great ocean.” In order to take to the great ocean, he issued a proclamation in the city of Sūrpāraka with the ringing of bells: “Sirs, merchants living in the city of Sūrpāraka, listen! The caravan leader Pūrṇa will take to the great ocean. Whoever among you who wants to take to the great ocean with the caravan leader Pūrṇa, free from taxes, duties, and boatman’s fees, should prepare your merchandise to carry across the great ocean.”</p>
<p>Five hundred merchants prepared their merchandise to carry across the great ocean. Then the caravan leader Pūrṇa, after performing rituals that bring good fortune, blessings, and well-being, took to the great ocean with his retinue and the five hundred merchants, and then returned to the city of Sūrpāraka, having succeeded on his voyage.</p>
<p>Six times Pūrṇa took to the great ocean and returned, having succeeded on each voyage.</p>
<p>Everywhere it was said, “Six times Pūrṇa took to the great ocean and returned, having succeeded on each voyage.” Then, the merchants of Śrāvastī came to the city of Sūrpāraka bearing their merchandise. After they were fully rested, they went to the caravan leader Pūrṇa. When they arrived, they said, “Caravan leader, let us leave for the great ocean.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” Pūrṇa replied, “have any of you ever seen or heard of anyone who, six times, returned from the great ocean after succeeding on each voyage, and was going a seventh time?”</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa, we came a long way to see you. If you do not go, we will not go either because you are the authority,” the merchants said.</p>
<p>Pūrṇa thought, “Although there is no wealth at all that I need, I will go for the sake of these people.” Then Pūrṇa left for the great ocean together with the merchants.</p>
<p>At dawn the merchants recited the Udāna, Pārāyaṇa, Satyadṛś, Sthaviragāthā, Sthavirīgāthā, Śailagāthā, Munigāthā, and Arthavargīya Sūtras. Pūrṇa heard them and said, “Sirs, you are singing good songs.”</p>
<p>“Caravan leader,” they replied, “these are not songs.”</p>
<p>“Then what are they?”</p>
<p>“They are the words of the Buddha.”</p>
<p>When Pūrṇa heard the sound buddha, a word he had never heard before, the hairs in every pore of his body stood on end. Pūrṇa asked reverently,  “Sirs, who is the Buddha?”</p>
<p>The merchants explained, “There is a son of the Śākyans, a śramaṇa of the Gautama family, who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. He awoke to supreme, complete awakening. Caravan leader, he is the Buddha.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, where is that blessed one now?”</p>
<p>“Caravan leader, he is staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.”</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, Pūrṇa took to the great ocean together with them and came back, having succeeded on his voyage.</p>
<p>His brother Bhavila thought, “He is tired from continually traveling the great ocean. He should get married.” He then asked Pūrṇa, “Tell me, which daughter of which merchant, businessman, or caravan leader shall I request for you?”</p>
<p>“I do not want an object of desire,” Pūrṇa replied. “If you allow it, I will go forth.”</p>
<p>“You did not go forth when we were not engaged in the family business. Why do you go forth now?” asked Bhavila.</p>
<p>“It was not appropriate then,” replied Pūrṇa. “It is appropriate now.”</p>
<p>Bhavila, knowing he would insist, allowed Pūrṇa to go forth.</p>
<p>“Brother,” said Pūrṇa, “there is much danger and little to gain on the great ocean. Many people take to it but only a few of them return. So you should never take to the great ocean. You have abundant wealth gained properly, while your brothers have what was gained improperly. So you should not live with them if they ask you to live together.”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa went to Śrāvastī with a servant. He stayed in the park of Śrāvastī and sent his servant as a messenger to the householder Anāthapiṇḍada, saying, “Householder, the caravan leader Pūrṇa is staying in the park of Śrāvastī, hoping to meet you.”</p>
<p>Anāthapiṇḍada thought, “He must have come in a carriage, having grown tired of traveling by boat.” Then Anāthapiṇḍada asked, “Say, how much merchandise has he brought with him?”</p>
<p>“What merchandise? He came only with me, a servant.”</p>
<p>“It would not be appropriate for me to invite that important person to my house without honoring him,” thought Anāthapiṇḍada. So, he invited Pūrṇa to his house with great honor: he offered him a massage, let him bathe, and gave him food. When they sat down, talking pleasantly, Anāthapiṇḍada asked, “Caravan leader, what is the purpose of your coming here?”</p>
<p>“Householder, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.”</p>
<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada stretched his upper body, raised his right hand, and spoke an inspired utterance: “O Buddha, O Dharma, O Saṅgha! O well-taught Dharma! A great person like this, abandoning a great many relatives and friends and full treasuries and warehouses, now wishes to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.”</p>
<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada took the caravan leader Pūrṇa to the Blessed One. At that time the Blessed One was teaching the Dharma, seated before an audience of many hundreds of monks. When the Blessed One saw the householder Anāthapiṇḍada coming with a gift, he said to the monks, “Monks, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada is coming with a gift. For the Tathāgata, there is no gift equal to this, a person to be tamed.”</p>
<p>The householder Anāthapiṇḍada bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side together with the caravan leader Pūrṇa. When Anāthapiṇḍada had sat down, he said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, the caravan leader Pūrṇa wishes to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. May the Blessed One let him go forth and ordain him.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the householder Anāthapiṇḍada by remaining silent. Then the Blessed One said to the caravan leader Pūrṇa, “Come, monk, lead the pure life.”  As soon as the Blessed One said this, Pūrṇa’s hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe, with but a week’s worth of hair and beard, his bowl and pitcher in his hand, and standing like a monk who had been ordained a hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>Because the Tathāgata said “Come,”</p>
<p>His hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe,</p>
<p>His faculties at once calmed,</p>
<p>And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>At another time, the venerable Pūrṇa went to the Blessed One. When Pūrṇa arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Pūrṇa implored the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please preach to me a condensed Dharma so that after I have listened to the condensed Dharma from the Blessed One, I will come to dwell alone, in solitude, carefully and diligently, directing myself toward myself. If I dwell alone, in solitude, carefully and diligently, directing myself toward myself, I will, in this life, by my own supernormal knowledge, actualize and accomplish the supreme end of the pure life for which the sons of noble families go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards  and donned saffron robes, and I will understand, ‘My births have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ ”</p>
<p>When the venerable Pūrṇa had finished speaking, the Blessed One said to him, “Good, good, Pūrṇa! Pūrṇa, it was good that you said this: ‘Please preach to me a condensed Dharma . . . . I will not know another existence after this one.’ Therefore, listen well and keep this in mind and I will preach to you.</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa, there are visual objects to be cognized by the eye that are attractive, desirable, delightful, pleasing to behold, and connected with desire, and that give rise to clinging. If a monk sees these visual objects and rejoices in, welcomes, clings to, and remains attached to them, joy will arise in he who rejoices in, welcomes, clings to, and remains attached to them. If there is joy, the joy will turn into delight and pleasure. If there is delight and pleasure, it will turn into clinging. If there is clinging, it will turn into a fetter. A monk who has come to have delight, clinging, and fetters, Pūrṇa, is said to be far from nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa, there are auditory objects to be cognized by the ear, olfactory objects to be cognized by the nose, gustatory objects to be cognized by the tongue, tangible objects to be cognized by the body, and  mental objects to be cognized by the mind that are attractive, desirable, delightful, pleasing to behold, and connected with desire, and that give rise to clinging. If a monk knows these objects . . . he is said to be far from nirvāṇa.</p>

<p>“Pūrṇa, since I have entrusted you with this condensed instruction, then where do you want to dwell? Where do you want to live?”</p>
<p>“Honored One, since the Blessed One has entrusted me with this condensed instruction, I would like to go to Śroṇāparāntaka.”</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa,  the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are fierce, impetuous, rough, abusive, short tempered, and disparaging. Pūrṇa, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka directly abuse, ridicule, and disparage you with bad, coarse, and intolerable words, what will you think?”</p>
<p>“Honored One, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka directly abuse, ridicule, and disparage me with bad, coarse, and intolerable words, I will think, ‘Ah, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are proper. Ah, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are intelligent. Although they abuse, ridicule, and disparage me with bad, coarse, and intolerable words, they do not strike me with their hands or with clods of dirt.’ ”</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are fierce . . . and disparaging. Pūrṇa, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka strike you with their hands or with clods of dirt, what will you think?”</p>

<p>“Pūrṇa, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are fierce . . . and disparaging. Pūrṇa, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka strike you with sticks or with swords, what will you think?”</p>

<p>“Pūrṇa, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are fierce . . . and disparaging. Pūrṇa, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka  attempt to take your life, what will you think?”</p>
<p>“Honored One, if the people of Śroṇāparāntaka attempt to take my life, I will think, ‘Among the Blessed One’s disciples there are those who, because of this purulent body, are grieved and ashamed and self-loathing, and who cut themselves with swords, ingest poison, hang themselves, or throw themselves from a cliff to their deaths. Therefore, ah, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are proper. Ah, the people of Śroṇāparāntaka are intelligent. They liberate me from this purulent body with little trouble.’ ”</p>
<p>“Good, good, Pūrṇa! Pūrṇa, it is good that you who possess such patience and gentleness are able to dwell in Śroṇāparāntaka. Pūrṇa, go and liberate those who have not been liberated. Release those who have not been released. Relieve those who have not been relieved. Emancipate those who have not been emancipated.”</p>
<p>The venerable Pūrṇa praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. The venerable Pūrṇa then bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>After that night had passed, early in the morning the venerable Pūrṇa dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Śrāvastī for alms. He took a meal of almsfood in Śrāvastī and returned after the meal. He put in order the bedding and the seat he had used, took his bowl and his robe, and set out for Śroṇāparāntaka.  Traveling through the country, he arrived in due course at Śroṇāparāntaka.</p>
<p>Then, early in the morning the venerable Pūrṇa dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Śroṇāparāntaka for alms.</p>
<p>A hunter, carrying his bow and arrows and going to hunt deer, saw Pūrṇa and thought, “It is inauspicious that I saw this shaven-headed śramaṇa.”</p>
<p>When the hunter, his bow drawn, charged at the venerable Pūrṇa, the venerable Pūrṇa caught sight of him. Upon seeing him, Pūrṇa removed his upper robe and said, “Shoot this, sir, since I entered this place for the sake of this that is hard to fill up,” and then he spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“Quick, shoot an arrow into this stomach with its many ills,</p>
<p>For the sake of which birds wander in the sky, beasts are ensnared,</p>
<p>People wielding arrows, spears, and lances are killed in battle,</p>
<p>And fish, swimming around from hunger, affliction, and deprivation, are caught with fishhooks.”</p>
<p>The hunter thought, “This mendicant has such patience and gentleness. Why should I shoot him with an arrow?” When he thought thus, the hunter’s mind was filled with faith in the venerable Pūrṇa. Then the venerable Pūrṇa preached the Dharma to him and established him in the refuges and the rules of training. The venerable Pūrṇa also made five hundred other huntsmen lay brothers and five hundred women lay sisters. Five hundred monastery buildings were offered to him, and hundreds of couches, stools, cushions, pillows, and square blankets were also offered. After three months had passed, the venerable Pūrṇa actualized with his body the threefold knowledge and became an arhat.  He was free from desire for the three realms; . . .  and he  became an object of veneration, respect, and praise for the gods including Indra and Upendra.</p>
<p>Later, the two brothers of Dārukarṇin, having consumed and exhausted their possessions, came to Dārukarṇin and said, “Since that creature who was our misfortune has left our home, come, let us live together.”</p>
<p>“Who is that creature that you say was our misfortune?” asked Dārukarṇin.</p>
<p>“Pūrṇa, of course.”</p>
<p>“He is not a creature who brings misfortune; rather, he brought good fortune to my home.”</p>
<p>Dārukarṇin’s two brothers said, “Whether good fortune or misfortune, come, let us live together.”</p>
<p>“Your wealth was not gained properly while mine was gained properly,” replied Dārukarṇin. “Because of this difference, we cannot live together.”</p>
<p>“The son of a slave woman took to the great ocean many times and helped you gain your possessions, which you spend and boast about. How were you able to take to the great ocean?” asked Dārukarṇin’s two brothers.</p>
<p>Dārukarṇin, his pride hurt by his two brothers, thought, “I will take to the great ocean, too.” Having thought this . . . Dārukarṇin took to the great ocean. His ship was driven by a tail wind to a forest of gośīrṣacandana.</p>
<p>The guide said, “Sirs, this is the forest of gośīrṣacandana. So, choose and take wood from here.”</p>
<p>At that time, there was a yakṣa named Maheśvara, who was master of the forest of gośīrṣacandana, and he was away at a meeting of yakṣas. The merchants began to cut down the gośīrṣacandana trees with five hundred axes. When a yakṣa named Apriya saw the gośīrṣacandana trees being cut down with the five hundred axes, he went to the yakṣa Maheśvara and said to him, “Sir, please be informed  that the forest of gośīrṣacandana is being destroyed by five hundred axes. Thus, please do your duty, or what you ought to do.”</p>
<p>Then the yakṣa Maheśvara canceled the meeting of yakṣas, and, unable to bear it, caused a violent storm and set out for the forest of gośīrṣacandana.</p>
<p>The guide said, “Sirs, merchants of the continent of Jambu, listen. Since this is the very thing that is known as the fear of a great storm, think of a countermeasure.”</p>
<p>Then the merchants were frightened, terrified, dejected, and, with the hairs in every pore of their bodies standing on end, started to beg the gods for help, saying:</p>
<p>“O Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, Vāsava, and others,</p>
<p>Gods, humans, serpents, yakṣas, masters of the asuras,</p>
<p>Since we are utterly tormented and frightened,</p>
<p>May the fearless ones help us!”</p>
<p>Some bow to the husband of Śacī.</p>
<p>Others bow to Brahmā, Hari, and Śaṅkara.</p>
<p>To the deities who reside in the earth, in the trees and forest,</p>
<p>Those who are caught in a fiendish storm bow down, hoping for their protection.</p>
<p>Dārukarṇin stood undisturbed. The merchants asked him, “Caravan leader, why do you stand undisturbed while we are in intolerable pain and fear?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” replied Dārukarṇin, “my younger brother told me, ‘Brother, there is much danger and little to gain on the great ocean. Many people driven by desire take to it but only a few of them return. So, you should never take to the great ocean.’ I disobeyed my younger brother’s words and took to the great ocean. So what can I do now?”</p>
<p>“Who is your younger brother?”</p>
<p>“He is Pūrṇa.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” said the merchants, “the noble one Pūrṇa has the great power of merit. Let us seek refuge in him.”</p>
<p>Then they all, with one voice, exclaimed, “Homage to the noble one Pūrṇa!  Homage, homage to the noble one Pūrṇa!”</p>
<p>Gods who were delighted with the venerable Pūrṇa then went to him. When they arrived, they said to the venerable Pūrṇa, “Noble one, your elder brother feels intolerable pain and fear. Please consider rescuing him.”</p>
<p>The venerable Pūrṇa considered this, and entered a meditative state by which, directing his mind, he disappeared from Śroṇāparāntaka and appeared seated with his legs crossed on the edge of the ship in the great ocean. The storm was then turned back as if it had struck Mount Sumeru and was thwarted. The yakṣa Maheśvara thought, “Though, in the past, ships that were hit by a storm were tossed like a piece of cotton and broken apart, now the storm has been turned back as if it had struck Mount Sumeru and was thwarted. What was the cause of that?”</p>
<p>The yakṣa Maheśvara looked around and then discovered the venerable Pūrṇa seated with his legs crossed on the edge of the ship. When the yakṣa Maheśvara had discovered the venerable Pūrṇa, he asked, “Noble one Pūrṇa, why do you harass me?”</p>
<p>“O you whose nature is to grow old, why do I harass you?” asked the venerable Pūrṇa in return. “You are harassing me. Had I not attained a number of good qualities like these, you would have killed my brother, and only his name would have remained.”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” replied Maheśvara, “I am protecting this gośīrṣacandana for the wheel-turning king.”</p>
<p>“Sir, what do you think?” asked the venerable Pūrṇa. “Which is greater, a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, or a wheel-turning king?”</p>
<p>“Noble one, has the Blessed One appeared in the world?”</p>
<p>“He has.”</p>
<p>“If so, then fill your ship that is not yet full.”</p>
<p>Their lives having been saved, the minds of the merchants were then filled with faith in Pūrṇa.  They filled the ship with gośīrṣacandana, set out again, and arrived in due course at the city of Sūrpāraka.</p>
<p>Pūrṇa then said to his brother, “Since your treasures belong to the one by whose name you, having succeeded on your voyage, were able to return, you should distribute them to these merchants. With this gośīrṣacandana, I will build a palace garlanded with sandalwood for the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Dārukarṇin distributed his treasures to the merchants. The venerable Pūrṇa then began to build a palace with a hall of gośīrṣacandana. He called the craftsmen together and asked them, “Sirs, would you like to take five hundred kārṣāpaṇas every day or take one viḍālapada of gośīrṣacandana dust?”</p>
<p>“Noble one,” they replied, “we would like to take one viḍālapada of gośīrṣacandana dust.”</p>
<p>The palace garlanded with sandalwood was then quickly built and made clean. The wood chips and remaining dust of gośīrṣacandana were crushed into powder and smeared on the palace walls.</p>
<p>Pūrṇa reconciled with his eldest brother and his other two brothers and said, “Invite the community of monks headed by the Buddha and offer a meal.”</p>
<p>“Noble one Pūrṇa, where is the Blessed One?”</p>
<p>“In Śrāvastī.”</p>
<p>“How far is that?”</p>
<p>“To Śrāvastī, it is more than one hundred yojanas.”</p>
<p>“We will ask His Majesty for permission.”</p>
<p>“You should do so.”</p>
<p>The brothers went to the king and said, “Your Majesty, we would like to invite the community of monks headed by the Buddha and offer a meal. Please help us.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, I will do so.”</p>
<p>The venerable Pūrṇa then went up to the roof, looked in the direction of the Jetavana, dropped to his knees, scattered flowers, burned incense, made a layman hold a golden pitcher,  and began to pray:</p>
<p>“O you of pure conduct, one with greatly pure intellect,</p>
<p>One who always seeks to benefit at mealtimes,</p>
<p>Please look upon those who are masterless—</p>
<p>Have compassion and come.”</p>
<p>Then the flowers, by the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods, formed the shape of a flower pavilion, and that flower pavilion came to abide at the elders’ dwelling in the Jetavana. The smoke of the incense was woven together like a cloud. The water assumed the shape of a lapis lazuli vessel. Since the venerable Ānanda was familiar with omens, he made the gesture of supplication and asked the Blessed One, “Honored One, where is this invitation from?”</p>
<p>“From Sūrpāraka, Ānanda.”</p>
<p>“Honored One, how far is Sūrpāraka from here?”</p>
<p>“More than a hundred yojanas, Ānanda. Go and give this order to the monks: ‘Those who, among you, will go to the city of Sūrpāraka and have a meal there tomorrow should take a counting stick.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, and he took the counting sticks and sat down before the Blessed One. The Blessed One and the monks who were the most venerable of the elders took counting sticks.</p>
<p>At that time, the venerable elder Pūrṇa, who was an elder from Kuṇḍopadāna and had been liberated through wisdom, was sitting in the assembly. When the venerable elder Pūrṇa also tried to take a counting stick, the venerable Ānanda spoke this verse to him:</p>
<p>“Venerable one, this meal is not a meal</p>
<p>In the court of the king of Kosala,</p>
<p>The house of Sudatta,</p>
<p>Or the house of Mṛgāra.</p>
<p>“We are going to a city called Sūrpāraka,</p>
<p>More than a hundred yojanas distant from here,</p>
<p>With our magical power.</p>
<p>Pūrṇa, remain here silently.”</p>
<p>Although the venerable elder Pūrṇa had been liberated through wisdom, he had not attained magical power. Therefore he asked himself, “Why am I disheartened by lack of magical power even like that of the non-Buddhist ascetics when I have searched for the whole collection of defilements within myself, discarded all the defilements, abandoned them, and driven them away?”</p>
<p>The venerable elder Pūrṇa exerted his vigor and gave rise to magical power. He stretched his arm, which was like the trunk of an elephant, and took a counting stick before the venerable Ānanda passed a counting stick to a third elder, and the venerable elder Pūrṇa spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“O Gautama, in this world, the six sorts of supernormal knowledge</p>
<p>Are not attained by fame, learning,</p>
<p>Various types of military force,</p>
<p>Words, or a great wish.</p>
<p>“Those who realize as I do,</p>
<p>Even if their youth has been diminished by old age,</p>
<p>Become endowed with the six sorts of supernormal knowledge</p>
<p>By the power of tranquility, moral conduct, insight, and the various powers of dhyāna.”</p>
<p>On that occasion the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, this is the best of my monks, the best of my disciples for taking a counting stick for offerings. The elder Pūrṇa, who is an elder from Kuṇḍopadāna, is the best of those who take a counting stick.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One instructed the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and say to the monks, ‘Though I have said, “Monks, you should live not displaying your virtue and not hiding your evil,” those among you who have attained magical power should go by means of that power to the city of Sūrpāraka and have a meal, because there are non-Buddhist ascetics in the city.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he said to the monks, “Venerables, the Blessed One said, ‘Though I have said, “Monks, you should live not displaying your virtue and not hiding your evil,” . . . because there are non-Buddhist ascetics in the city.’ ”</p>
<p>The king had beautified the city of Sūrpāraka by removing stones, pebbles, and gravel, sprinkling sandalwood water, setting out sweet-smelling censers, hanging many silk tassels, and scattering flowers around the city.</p>
<p>There were eighteen gates around the city of Sūrpāraka, and the king had seventeen sons. At each surrounding gate a prince stood with the highest majesty. At the largest gate stood the king, the ruler of Sūrpāraka, with the great majesty of kings, together with the venerable Pūrṇa, Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin.</p>
<p>The king then saw those handing out leaves, those handing out grass, and those handing out receptacles coming by means of their magical power and asked, “Reverend Pūrṇa, is the Blessed One coming?”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa replied, “This is not the Blessed One but rather those handing out leaves, those handing out grass, and those handing out receptacles.”</p>
<p>At that time the monks who were the most venerable of the elders came by practicing dhyāna, and the king again asked, “Reverend Pūrṇa, is the Blessed One coming?”</p>
<p>“No,” Pūrṇa replied. “They are the monks who are the most venerable of the elders who have come by practicing dhyāna.”</p>
<p>A lay brother then spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“Some come riding lions, tigers, elephants, horses, nāgas, or bulls;</p>
<p>Some come seated on heavenly vehicles made from jewels, mountains, trees, or beautiful chariots;</p>
<p>And others come through the sky, like clouds adorned by garlands of lightning, joyfully,</p>
<p>As if going to the palace of the gods, by means of magical power.</p>
<p>“Some appear on the ground, breaking through the surface of the earth,</p>
<p>Some descend from the center of the sky,</p>
<p>And some emerge from their seats.</p>
<p>Look at the ability of those with magical power.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One  washed his feet outside the monastery, entered inside, sat on the prepared seat, stretched his back, and focused his mind on a point in front of himself. When the Blessed One put his foot down with a specific intention in the perfume chamber, the great earth quaked in six ways. This great earth quaked, quaked furiously, and quaked absolutely furiously. It roared, roared furiously, and roared absolutely furiously. When the eastern side rose, the western side sank. When the western side rose, the eastern side sank. When the southern side rose, the northern side sank. When the northern side rose, the southern side sank. When the periphery rose, the middle sank. When the middle rose, the periphery sank. The king asked Pūrṇa, “Noble one Pūrṇa, what is this?”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa answered, “Because the Blessed One put his foot down with a specific intention in the perfume chamber, the great earth quaked in six ways.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then emanated a ray of light colored like the radiance of gold, by which the continent of Jambu blazed like molten gold. Again the king stared in surprise and asked, “Noble one Pūrṇa, what is this?”</p>
<p>Pūrṇa answered, “Great King, the Blessed One emanated a ray of light colored like the radiance of gold.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then went to Sūrpāraka together with five hundred arhats, himself tamed and his assembly tamed, himself pacified and his assembly pacified.</p>
<p>A god who lived in the Jetavana followed the Blessed One, holding a branch of vakula with which he provided shade for him. The Blessed One knew the god’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him, and caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. When the god had heard the Dharma, he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>There then lived in another place about five hundred widows, and they saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks,  ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels whose light surpasses a thousand suns. As soon as the five hundred widows saw him, great faith in the Blessed One arose in them.</p>
<p>It is commonplace that when beings who possess the cause of having accumulated roots of merit look at the Buddha for the first time, they experience far greater pleasure than that of those who have practiced tranquility of mind for a dozen years, those who gain a son after having been childless, those who look upon treasure after having been poor, or those who are anointed as king after having longed for kingship.</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One knew that it was the right time to train the widows, and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The women bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then they sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivities, dispositions, and nature . . . and they actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After seeing the four truths of the noble ones, they spoke an inspired utterance three times: “Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for us is what has never been done for us by our mothers, our fathers, a king, gods, our husbands, our kinsmen and relatives, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, or brahmins.  You have dried up the ocean of blood and tears, liberated us from the mountain of bones, shut the gate to inferior states of existence, opened the gates to liberation and heaven, and placed us among gods and humans. O Honored One, we have been exalted, truly exalted! Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, may the Blessed One accept us as lay sisters.”</p>
<p>They rose from their seats, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and implored the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, please give us something to worship.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then cut off his hair and nails by means of his magical power and gave his hair and nails to the widows. They built a stūpa for the hair and nails of the Blessed One. After that, the god who lived in the Jetavana planted a vakula tree along the stūpa’s circumambulatory path, and then the god who lived in the Jetavana said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, I will stay here, worshiping this stūpa.”</p>
<p>The god who lived in the Jetavana stayed there. Some people named the place the widows’ stūpa, and other people named it the circumambulatory path of the vakula. Monks who worship the stūpa worship the place even now.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then departed. At that time, there lived five hundred ṛṣis in a hermitage. Since the hermitage was abundant in flowers, fruits, and water, the ṛṣis were intoxicated with those things and were without worries. The Blessed One then knew that it was the right time to train the five hundred ṛṣis and went to the hermitage. When the Blessed One arrived, with his magical power he destroyed the flowers and fruits of the hermitage, dried up the water, dug up the meadow, and smashed the residence to pieces. The ṛṣis were then plunged into grief, resting their cheeks on their hands.</p>
<p>The Blessed One asked, “Why are you plunged into grief?”</p>
<p>“Blessed One,” they replied, “after you, a human field of merit, came here, we were placed in a grievous situation.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then asked, “Ṛṣis, why was the hermitage, which was abundant in flowers, fruits, and water, ruined? Shall I make the hermitage as it was before?”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, please do so.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then ceased his magical power, and the hermitage became as it had been before. Thus, the five hundred ṛṣis were very much astonished, and their minds were filled with faith in the Blessed One. The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivities, dispositions, and natures, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. When the five hundred ṛṣis had heard the Dharma, they actualized the fruit of a never-returner and achieved magical power. They then made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said, “Honored One, we wish to go forth and be ordained monks in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. We will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, using the “Come, monk” formula of ordination, said, “Come, monks, lead the pure life.”  As soon as the Blessed One said this, their hair fell out and they were clad in their outer robes, with but a week’s worth of hair and beards, their bowls and pitchers in their hands, standing like monks who had been ordained a hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>Because the Tathāgata said “come,”</p>
<p>Their hair fell out and they were clad in their outer robes,</p>
<p>Their faculties at once calmed,</p>
<p>And their bodies swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>Exerting themselves, endeavoring and striving, they came to understand saṃsāra’s ever-revolving five cycles, overthrew all conditioned states . . . and the five hundred ṛṣis became objects of veneration, respect, and praise for the gods including Indra and Upendra.  The ṛṣi who was their leader said, “Blessed One, I deceived many people in this guise. I will go forth after making the people’s faith arise.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, surrounded, in the shape of a half-moon, by the five hundred ṛṣis and monks who had been monks from the beginning, soared with them into the air from there using his magical power, and arrived in due course at Mount Musalaka.</p>
<p>At that time there lived a ṛṣi on Mount Musalaka named Vakkalin. He saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man . . . . As soon as Vakkalin saw the Blessed One, his mind was filled with faith in the Blessed One. When Vakkalin’s faith had arisen, he thought, “Now I will descend from the mountain and go to meet the Blessed One. The Blessed One may pass through here out of consideration for people to be trained. Therefore, I will now throw myself off the mountain.”</p>
<p>Thinking thus, Vakkalin threw himself from the top of the mountain. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, have a watchful nature, the Blessed One caught him with his magical power. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him. When Vakkalin had heard the Dharma, he actualized the fruit of a never-returner and achieved magical power. Then Vakkalin said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya . . . .”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, saying “Come, monk,” . . . . </p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, it is he, the monk Vakkalin, who is the best of the monks who were emancipated by faith.”</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One, surrounded by a thousand monks, performing miracles, went to the city of Sūrpāraka. The Blessed One thought, “If I enter from one gate, those who are at the other gates will be disappointed. Thus, I will enter by using my magical power.”</p>
<p>So the Blessed One entered the city of Sūrpāraka from the sky using his magical power. Then the king, the ruler of Sūrpāraka, and the venerable Pūrṇa, Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin, as well as the seventeen princes, went to the Blessed One along with the attendants of each one and hundreds of thousands of other beings.</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One, accompanied by hundreds of thousands of beings, went to the palace garlanded with sandalwood and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Since the large crowd could not see the Blessed One, the crowd started to destroy the palace garlanded with sandalwood. The Blessed One thought, “If the palace garlanded with sandalwood is destroyed, such destruction will decrease the donors’ merit. Now I will transform this palace into a palace made of crystal.” The Blessed One transformed the palace into a palace made of crystal so that the large crowd could see the Buddha’s body without obstructions blocking the view.</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew the audience’s thinking, proclivities,  dispositions, and natures, and so preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. When the audience had heard the Dharma, hundreds of thousands of beings attained great excellence. Some generated the roots of merit of liberation, some generated the roots of merit of penetration, some actualized the fruit of stream-entry, some the fruit of a never-returner, and some went forth, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat. Some generated the intention for the awakening of disciples, some the intention for the awakening of a self-awakened one, and some the intention for complete and supreme awakening.</p>
<p>Most of the audience became absorbed in the Buddha, devoted to the Dharma, and inclined to the Saṅgha.</p>
<p>Dārukarṇin, Stavakarṇin, and Trapukarṇin then prepared a pure and fine meal, arranged seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>At that time there lived in the great ocean two nāga kings named Kṛṣṇa and Gautama. They both thought, “Since the Blessed One is preaching the Dharma in the city of Sūrpāraka, let’s go to listen to the Dharma.” Then they both, along with five hundred nāga attendants, departed for the city of Sūrpāraka, creating five hundred rivers flowing toward the city. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, have a watchful nature, the Blessed One thought, “If these two nāga kings, Kṛṣṇa and Gautama, come to the city of Sūrpāraka, they will ruin the country.” The Blessed One then said to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana,  “Maudgalyāyana, accept the alms requiring haste by the Tathāgata. Why, Maudgalyāyana? Because there are five kinds of alms requiring haste. What are the five? The almsfood of temporary visitors, of those who are setting forth on a journey, of sick people, of those attending the sick, and of monks responsible for monastic property.”</p>
<p>In this situation, the Blessed One intended that the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana would be the monk who was responsible for monastic property.</p>
<p>The Blessed One soared up into the air from there, using his magical power. The two, the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, went to the nāga kings Kṛṣṇa and Gautama. When the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had arrived, the Blessed One said, “Lords of nāgas, you should be attentive to the city of Sūrpāraka, and you should not destroy the country.”</p>
<p>“Honored One,” said the nāga kings, “we have come here with faith, because of which we never harm any beings, even ants, to say nothing of the people living in the city of Sūrpāraka.”</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One preached the Dharma to the nāga kings Kṛṣṇa and Gautama, the hearing of which caused them to seek refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and to accept the rules of training.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had begun his meal, each nāga thought, “Ah, may the Blessed One drink my water!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One thought, “If I drink water from only one individual, it will disappoint the others. Therefore, I must devise a plan to drink the water of everyone.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One instructed the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, go and bring water from the very point where the five hundred rivers meet.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, and he filled a bowl with water at the very point where the five hundred rivers met and returned to the Blessed One, bringing the water with him. When he arrived, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana offered the bowl of water to the Blessed One,  and the Blessed One accepted the water and drank it.</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana thought, “The Blessed One once said, ‘Monks, fathers and mothers do what is quite difficult to do because they nourish their children, raise them, bring them up, feed them, and teach them everything on the continent of Jambu. Even if a son should try to carry his parents, his mother on one shoulder and his father on the other, for a hundred years; if he should give them the earth’s jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, glass, coral, silver, gold, agate, amber, ruby, and shells; or if he should put his parents in a position of power, the son cannot truly help or sufficiently repay his father and mother with such efforts. If a person motivates his parents to have complete faith, and leads them to, leads them to enter into, and leads them to stand safely in their faith when they do not have faith; if he motivates them to have completely good conduct when they have disordered conduct; if he motivates them to be completely generous when they are ungenerous; if he motivates them to have complete intelligence, and leads them to, leads them to enter into, and leads them to stand safely in their intelligence when they have disordered intelligence, he comes to truly help and repay his father and mother with just such efforts.’ Since I have not yet repaid my mother, now I will consider where my mother has been reborn.”</p>
<p>When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana considered this, he found that she had been reborn in the Marīcika world. Then he observed by whom she should be trained and found that it was the Blessed One. He thought, “Since I have come here from a distance, I will by all means tell this to the Blessed One.” The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, the Blessed One once said, ‘Monks, fathers and mothers do what is quite difficult to do.’  My mother has been reborn in the Marīcika world and she is one who should be trained by the Blessed One. May the Blessed One have compassion and train her.”</p>
<p>“Maudgalyāyana, by whose magical power shall we go there?” asked the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“By mine, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana departed, stepping on the summit of Mount Sumeru, and arrived in the Marīcika world after seven days.</p>
<p>When she, Bhadrakanyā, saw the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana from a distance, she was delighted, and she went to him and said, “Ah, I see my son after so long! Ah, I see my son after so long!”</p>
<p>Then a large crowd asked, “Sirs, how is this girl the mother of this mendicant who is so old?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “this woman bore this body of mine. Thus, she is my mother.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew Bhadrakanyā’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her and that caused her to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  When Bhadrakanyā had heard the Dharma, she leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After she had seen the truths, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “. . . you placed me among gods and humans.” Again, she said:</p>
<p>“The terrible path to inferior states of existence,</p>
<p>With their many dangers, was closed by you.</p>
<p>The path to the heavens, with their excellent merits,</p>
<p>Was opened, and I found the path to nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Supported by you, I acquired the pure eye</p>
<p>That is extremely pure and free from fault.</p>
<p>After obtaining the pacified state that pleases the noble ones,</p>
<p>I will cross over to the far shore beyond the ocean of suffering.</p>
<p>“O, you who are venerated by the gods and humans of this world,</p>
<p>Who is free from birth, old age, illness, and death,</p>
<p>Muni who is hard to see even should we be reborn a thousand times,</p>
<p>My encounter with you bore fruit right here and now.</p>
<p>“I am exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community, may you accept me as a lay sister. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.  Blessed One and Mahā­maudgalyāyana, please assent to my offer of a meal today.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Bhadrakanyā’s request by remaining silent, and Bhadrakanyā understood the Blessed One’s assent. Then Bhadrakanyā knew that the Blessed One and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had sat down in comfort, and with her own hands she served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When she had, with her own hands, served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One then preached the Dharma to Bhadrakanyā. When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had taken the Blessed One’s bowl and washed it, the Blessed One said, “Maudgalyāyana, shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, let us go.”</p>
<p>“By whose magical power?”</p>
<p>“The Blessed One’s, please.”</p>
<p>“Then think about the Jetavana.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, have we already arrived there?”</p>
<p>“We have arrived, Maudgalyāyana.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana was astonished and asked, “Blessed One, what is the name of this magical power?”</p>
<p>“Maudgalyāyana,  it is called manojavā (“swift as thought”).”</p>
<p>“Honored One, I had not known that the Buddha’s magical power was so profound. If I had known, I would never have turned my mind from the goal of complete and supreme awakening, even if my body had broken into pieces like grains of sesame. Now I am like firewood that has burned out, and I have no more opportunity.”</p>
<p>All the monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “Honored One, what karma did the venerable Pūrṇa create that matured to cause his birth in a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions? What karma did he create, because of which he was born from a female slave’s womb, went forth, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the monk Pūrṇa himself, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach him like a flood, inevitably. Who else but Pūrṇa would experience the actions that he himself performed and accumulated? Monks, actions performed and accumulated do not mature in the earth element, the water element, the fire element, or the wind element, which are outside the body. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated like this mature in the aggregates, elements, and sense spheres.</p>
<p>“Even after hundreds of eons,</p>
<p>Actions are never lost.</p>
<p>When the time and conditions are right,</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lives were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, who was a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans,  a buddha, and a blessed one. He stayed near the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“In the teachings of that buddha this Pūrṇa went forth, became well acquainted with the three divisions of the canon, and came to serve as the monk entrusted with the monastery’s business according to the rules. After a little while, an arhat became responsible for monastic property. When he started to clean the monastery, a wind arose and blew the dust hither and thither. The arhat thought, ‘I shall wait for a while until the wind has died down.’</p>
<p>“Then the monk entrusted with the monastery’s business saw that the monastery was unclean; fiercely angry, he spoke harshly: ‘Which son of a slave woman is responsible for monastic property?’</p>
<p>“The arhat thought, ‘Since this person is angry, I shall wait for a while and make him understand later.’ After the monk’s anger subsided, the arhat went to him and asked, ‘Do you know who I am?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I do,’ said the monk. ‘You and I went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“ ‘That is true,” said the arhat, ‘but I have finished what should be done by a mendicant. While I have been released from all bondage, you performed the action of speaking harshly because you remain bound by all bonds. Confess your sin as a sin and hence the action will diminish, waste away, and disappear.’</p>
<p>“The monk confessed his sin as a sin. Hence, although he had been doomed to be born in hell and become the son of a female slave, he was not born in hell but was born in a female slave’s womb for five hundred lives. And now, in his last life, he was also born in a female slave’s womb.</p>
<p>“And because he had served the community, he was born into a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions. And because he was well acquainted with the aggregates, elements,  sense spheres, and dependent origination through recitation and repetition, he went forth in my teaching, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“ Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative; the maturation of entirely positive actions is entirely positive; the maturation of those that are mixed is mixed. Therefore, monks, henceforth you should abandon entirely negative and mixed actions, and you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Blessed One, and the monks rejoiced in and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
<p>VI. Agnidatta</p>
<p>A. The Story of the Two Nāga Kings and King Bimbisāra</p>
<p>The following took place in Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>At that time, there lived in Rājagṛha two nāga kings named Valguka and Giri. Because of their power, five hundred hot springs were always flowing, the fountains, lakes, and ponds never dried up, and the gods brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, the harvest was exceedingly abundant.</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had converted the two nāga kings Nanda and Upananda, they both came every day from the terrace of Mount Sumeru to serve the Blessed One. The nāga kings Valguka and Giri thought, “While these nāga kings Nanda and Upananda come every day from the terrace of Mount Sumeru to serve the Blessed One, it is not good that we, living in this very place, do not serve the Blessed One. Therefore, let us serve the Blessed One, too.”</p>
<p>They went to the Blessed One, and when they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side,  the Blessed One preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. After they had heard the Dharma, they sought refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha and accepted the rules of training. Once they had sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, their bodies and the amount of food they needed for their bodies greatly increased. They both went to the Blessed One, and when they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Blessed One, and said, “Blessed One, when we sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, our bodies and the amount of food we needed for our bodies greatly increased. Blessed One, if the Blessed One would authorize it, we will enter the great ocean.”</p>
<p>“Lords of nāgas,” replied the Blessed One, “since you are living in the land of the king, ask the king for permission.”</p>
<p>The two considered this and stayed there, saying, “The Blessed One means that he does not give us permission.”</p>
<p>The nāga kings Valguka and Giri were always dressed as gods if they went to see the Blessed One at night, and as householders if they went by day. Dressed as householders, they both served the Blessed One every day.</p>
<p>Whenever King Bimbisāra went to see the Blessed One, the king, who was proud of his status as a kṣatriya, always sent his retainer ahead, saying, “There must not be anyone who does not stand up when he sees me.” Once, he sent a retainer, saying, “Hey, go and see who is serving the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The retainer went and saw two householders. He thought, “Since these two people are living in the land of His Majesty, why would they not stand up at the sight of His Majesty?”  He said to the king, “Your Majesty, there are two householders, and they are living in the very land of Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>King Bimbisāra thought, “Why would those two people not stand up at the sight of me? Therefore, I shall go.” Then he went to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>When the nāga kings Valguka and Giri saw King Bimbisāra, they asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if King Bimbisāra comes, to which should we show respect, the king or the Dharma?”</p>
<p>“Nāga kings, show respect to the Dharma,” replied the Blessed One. “Thus the buddhas, the blessed ones, also respected the true Dharma. The arhats also respected the Dharma.” He then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Those who were past buddhas,</p>
<p>Those who will be future buddhas,</p>
<p>And he who is the present Buddha</p>
<p>Conquer many sorrows.</p>
<p>“Those who have passed, those who will come, and he who is present</p>
<p>All respect the true Dharma.</p>
<p>This is the rule of the buddhas.</p>
<p>“Therefore, anyone here who wishes for their own benefit,</p>
<p>Who wishes for a great state for themselves,</p>
<p>Should remember the teachings of the Buddha</p>
<p>And show respect to the true Dharma.”</p>
<p>The two did not stand up, and the king found this unbearable. He requested, “May the Blessed One preach the Dharma.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“With thoughts of anger, confusion,</p>
<p>And impiety</p>
<p>You cannot understand the true Dharma</p>
<p>Preached by the Perfectly Awakened One.</p>
<p>“One who has controlled his thoughts</p>
<p>Of wrath and carelessness,</p>
<p>And abandoned thoughts of torment here,</p>
<p>Can understand what is well preached.”</p>
<p>The king thought, “Because these two householders came, the Blessed One  interrupted my hearing of the Dharma.” He rose from his seat, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed. When he had departed, he instructed his ministers, “Sirs, when those two householders depart from the presence of the Blessed One, order them both to leave my land.”</p>
<p>When they had both bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s two feet and departed, the ministers ordered them, “This was uttered from His Majesty’s lips: ‘You two must not live in my land.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” they both answered.</p>
<p>The nāga kings then thought, “We both obtained without difficulty the very thing for which we had long hoped.” They then caused a great flood and entered a small valley. Then from the small valley they entered a large valley, from the large valley a small river, from the small river a large river, and from the large river the great ocean. When they entered the great ocean, their bodies and the amount of food they needed for their bodies again greatly increased.</p>
<p>Later, the five hundred hot springs and the fountains, lakes, and ponds in Rājagṛha became smaller, depleted, and dried up, and the gods did not bring rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, there was a very poor harvest, a famine, and fear, and it was difficult for beggars in the wilderness to find food. The king thought, “In this Rājagṛha there once lived the nāga kings Giri and Valguka. Thanks to their power, five hundred hot springs were always flowing, the fountains, lakes, and ponds never dried up, the gods brought rain at the appropriate times, and therefore the harvest was abundant. But now the five hundred hot springs, fountains, lakes, and ponds have become smaller, depleted, and dried up,  and the gods have not brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, there has been a very poor harvest, a famine, and fear, and it is difficult for beggars in the wilderness to find food. Did the nāga kings Giri and Valguka die? Were they taken away by the king of birds, the garuḍa? Were they captured by a snake charmer? Perhaps they have run away frightened. Still, since the Buddha, the Blessed One, is omniscient, one who sees everything, I shall now ask the Blessed One this question.”</p>
<p>He went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Bimbisāra explained the matter in detail to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“Great King,” said the Blessed One, “neither has died, nor have they been taken away by the king of birds, the garuḍa, nor been captured by a snake charmer, and they have not run away frightened. But you yourself, who are the king, banished them from your land.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, I have never seen either of them, let alone banished them from my land.”</p>
<p>“Great King, I will remind you. Great King, do you remember banishing two householders from your land?”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, I remember that.”</p>
<p>“Those two people were the nāga kings Giri and Valguka.”</p>
<p>“Honored One, where are they now?”</p>
<p>“They have gone to the great ocean.”</p>
<p>“My land will be ruined!”</p>
<p>“Great King, beg the two of them for forgiveness, and your land will not be ruined.”</p>
<p>“How should I beg them for forgiveness when they are in the great ocean?”</p>
<p>“On the eighth and fourteenth days of the month, they both come dressed as householders to bow low until their foreheads touch my feet. At that time, I will make a sign. Then you should beg them for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“Blessed One, should I throw myself at their feet,  or should I not throw myself at their feet?”</p>
<p>“No, reach out your hand and say, ‘O nāga kings, forgive me,’ and you will be forgiven.”</p>
<p>The king was sitting patiently when the two nāga kings arrived. Just as they both came dressed as householders into the presence of the Blessed One, the king also came. And when the Blessed One made a sign, the king reached out his hand and said, “O you two nāga kings, please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Great King, you are forgiven.”</p>
<p>“If I am forgiven, please return.”</p>
<p>“Great King, since we sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, our bodies and the amount of food we need for our bodies have increased. If we come here with our present body size, even the whole country of Magadha would not be able to accommodate us.”</p>
<p>“Then the country of Magadha will be ruined!”</p>
<p>“It will not be ruined.”</p>
<p>“Why will it not?”</p>
<p>“Have two palaces built for us and offer worship every six months, and we will make our attendants stay there and gather together at the time of worship.”</p>
<p>The king did as he had been told. The two nāga kings made their attendants stay there, and the nāga kings received his worship themselves.</p>
<p>B. The Quarrel between the Brahmin Agnidatta and the Citizens of Rājagṛha</p>
<p>Later, when their attendants were living in idleness, wicked nāgas took the opportunity to cause hail. In Rājagṛha, there was a brahmin who was familiar with a charm against hail, and he stopped the hail each time. The people living in the country of Magadha gave him an allotment.</p>
<p>There was another brahmin named Agnidatta in the southern region who was also familiar with a charm against hail. He heard that there was a country in the northern region named Powerful over which a king named Best Army ruled, that there was the residence of a nāga king named Sundara in that country,  and that there was a medicine that had great potency and surpassed any other medicine. He decided to go there in order to get the medicine. He departed and in due course he arrived at Rājagṛha, where he stayed in the residence of the first brahmin who had the charm against hail. Then, when it hailed a lot, the brahmin who had originally lived there was unable to stop the hail and, at a loss, was going in and out of the house again and again. The brahmin Agnidatta asked him, “Sir, why are you going in and out of the house again and again?”</p>
<p>“Because I cannot stop the great hail, my son,” said the first brahmin.</p>
<p>“I shall stop it.”</p>
<p>“That would be good, my son.”</p>
<p>Agnidatta placed a spell on some water and sprinkled the water, whereupon the cloud broke into a hundred pieces and dispersed. The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha were very surprised and went to the brahmin’s house, bringing gifts. “Sir,” they said, “the people in Rājagṛha are rejoicing. Please accept our gifts.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because you stopped the great hail.”</p>
<p>“I did not stop the hail,” he told them, “this brahmin did.”</p>
<p>They went to the brahmin Agnidatta and said, “O young brahmin, please remain here and we shall give you an allotment.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I shall live here.”</p>
<p>So, he lived there. He stopped the hail with the charm and for a while it never hailed. The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha said to each other, “Sirs, since it does not hail thanks to our own merits, why should we give him an allotment?” They stopped giving the allotment.</p>
<p>The brahmin Agnidatta then stopped using his charm and went to the country of Powerful, and later it started to hail again. The people went to the brahmin who had originally lived there and asked him, “Sir, where is the young brahmin?”</p>
<p>He replied, “Since you did not treat him with respect, he has left.”</p>
<p>“Sir, if he comes back, please let us know.”</p>
<p>“I shall do so.”</p>
<p>Agnidatta went in due course to King Best Army. Upon his arrival, he wished King Best Army victory  and long life and said, “Your Majesty, there is a nāga king named Sundara in your land, and there is a medicine named immediate effect in his residence. Your Majesty, please tell me where he is, and I will offer you a portion of the medicine.”</p>
<p>“O brahmin,” said the king, “since the nāga king Sundara is fierce, he will certainly defeat you.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, for the time being I have the power of a charm and the power of medicine. If the continent of Jambu were to be filled with nāgas like the nāga king Sundara as densely as a thicket of sugarcane or a thicket of reeds, a single hair of mine would not be moved by the nāgas, much less so by the nāga king Sundara alone. By the way, is there any citizen of Your Majesty who is to be executed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there is, brahmin.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, please summon him here and make him tell me where the residence of the nāga king is.”</p>
<p>The king then summoned the man and ordered him, “Hey, tell this brahmin where the residence of the nāga king Sundara is.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to the king, and he departed, guiding the brahmin. Then, after having traveled for some distance, the man halted and said to the brahmin, “Brahmin, do you see that green forest rising up over there?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“That is the residence of the nāga king Sundara.”</p>
<p>Agnidatta went there and bound the medicine called immediate effect in a bundle, brought it to the country of Powerful, and gave King Best Army his portion of the medicine. He arrived in due course at Rājagṛha and stayed at the house of the original brahmin. Then, when the brahmin had called together the brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha, they brought offerings and said, “O young brahmin, please remain here. We shall give you an allotment.”</p>
<p>Agnidatta replied, “Since you did not treat me with respect, I will not remain.”</p>
<p>They started to insist that he stay, entreated him, made a promise, and provided him with sustenance.</p>
<p>Since people in the world desire prosperity and abhor decline, Agnidatta  took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a boy was born, and Agnidatta named his son Mountain. When the couple again played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, a girl was born, and Agnidatta named his daughter Hail. The name of the brahmin’s wife was Free from the Cycle. The name of his son’s wife was Lightning.</p>
<p>Agnidatta thought, “What is the use of my stopping the hail each and every time? I will use a charm to block it for a long time.” Because he used a charm to block the hail for a long time, it did not hail.</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders in Rājagṛha said to each other, “Sirs, since it does not hail thanks to our own merits, why should we give him an allotment?” They stopped giving the allotment. The brahmin, out of jealousy, had not taught the words of the charm even to his son, and, attached to his life of ease, he had neither recited the charm nor kept the medicine dry, whereupon he forgot the words of the charm and found the medicine rotten because it had not been dried.</p>
<p>Agnidatta, who had once trusted the brahmins and the householders in Rājagṛha but again began to quarrel with them, visited the residences of non-Buddhist ascetics and the forests of ascetics here and there and asked them, “Sirs, is there any means to attain all that I want and seek?”</p>
<p>On those occasions, one said, “Enter into a fire”; another one said, “Take poison”; another one said, “Throw yourself from a cliff”; and another one said, “Tie a rope around your neck and hang yourself from the bough of a tree.” All of them thus taught a means of death, not a means of going forth.</p>
<p>He went to the Bamboo Grove and saw a monk  and asked him, “Noble one, is there any means to attain all that I want and seek?”</p>
<p>“Go forth in the presence of the Blessed One,” said the monk.</p>
<p>“What will I do there?”</p>
<p>“You should, throughout your life, lead the pure life and be engaged in dhyāna and recitation. If you attain omniscience in this present life, you will have arrived at the end of your suffering. On the other hand, should you die with your fetters remaining, you will attain all that you want and seek.”</p>
<p>“Noble one, if I cannot do that, is there any other means?”</p>
<p>“Invite the community of monks headed by the Buddha and offer a meal.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me another way in case I cannot do that either.”</p>
<p>“Invite the four great disciples who are like a wish-fulfilling vase, offer them a meal, and make an aspiration, and you will attain all that you want and seek.”</p>
<p>“Noble one, I can do that. I will.”</p>
<p>He invited the four great disciples who are like a wish-fulfilling vase, offered them a meal, and made this aspiration: “May this root of merit cause Sundara to die and disappear from the state of a nāga and allow me be born there, and after that do harm to the people of Rājagṛha!”</p>
<p>His wife asked him, “My dear, what aspiration did you make?”</p>
<p>“I made an aspiration that this root of merit might cause Sundara to die and disappear from the state of a nāga and allow me to be born there, and after that do harm to the people of Rājagṛha.”</p>
<p>“Good. May I become your wife when you get your wish!”</p>
<p>His son said, “May I become your son, too!”</p>
<p>His daughter said likewise, “May I become your daughter, too!”</p>
<p>And his son’s wife said likewise, “May I become your son’s wife, too!”</p>
<p>When they entered an old house  and slept, rain fell from a cloud of five colors, and they were all killed, crushed by a falling wall. After the nāga Sundara had died, they were born there with sixty thousand attendant nāgas. The nāga who had been Agnidatta in his former life then became known as Sundara, too. His wife’s name became Free from the Cycle, his son’s name Mountain, his daughter’s name Hail, and his son’s wife’s name Lightning.</p>
<p>It is natural that male nāgas and female nāgas remember three things just after birth: where they died, where they were reborn, and by what action. The nāga observed that he had died in the human world. Where was he born? In the midst of nāgas. By what karma? By the force of an aspiration. For what purpose? For the purpose of doing harm to the people in Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>He asked himself, “Which causes greater suffering to people, doing harm to crops that have just sprung up, or to crops that have not yet sprung up?” He saw that doing harm to crops that have not yet sprung up would do less damage than doing harm to crops that have just sprung up. He ordered his attendants, “Sirs, now cause all the crops in the country of Magadha to grow with rain today.” They caused all the crops to grow. Then he, with his sixty thousand attendants, caused rain as thick as the shafts of a plough, which looked as if it would carry away everything down to the last straw. Because of this, the people said to each other, “This nāga carried away even the straw.” The nāga’s name thus became Apalāla (Without a Straw).</p>

<p>I. Rājagṛha</p>
<p>A. The Disaster of Rājagṛha and Its End</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was once staying in Kalandaka­nivāpa Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>When Prince Ajātaśatru was enticed by Devadatta to kill his own father, who was a righteous Dharma king, and crown himself king, he began to perform a number of disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One  and set the elephant Dhanapālaka and a fierce dog on the Blessed One in order to kill him.</p>
<p>His mother, Vaidehī, told him, “My son, do not perform disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One will leave Rājagṛha, which is bound to be a loss for us. Thanks to the Blessed One’s power, the people of the countries of Aṅga and Magadha have been rich and enjoyed themselves.”</p>
<p>In an agitated state of mind, he replied, “Will a country where the Blessed One is not staying become ruined and uninhabited?” All his mother’s attempts to stop him were in vain.</p>
<p>The Blessed One thought, “Since this Prince Ajātaśatru has performed a number of nonmeritorious acts, now is not a good time for me to establish him in rootless faith. Therefore I shall go to Śrāvastī.” Thereupon the Blessed One, with the community of disciples, traveled toward Śrāvastī. In due course, he arrived in Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>Neighboring minor kings heard that since Ajātaśatru had performed disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One, the Blessed One had become concerned about such disrespectful acts, left Rājagṛha, and arrived in Śrāvastī. They thought, “For the time being, that sinful king, after having killed his father who was a righteous Dharma king, is not content and has performed disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One, who is venerated by gods, asuras, and humans. Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One left Rājagṛha and arrived in Śrāvastī. Therefore, by whatever means, we shall dethrone him.”</p>
<p>They sent messengers to each other and unified their efforts, prepared an army consisting of four divisions, and set off for Rājagṛha with an elephant division,  a horse division, a chariot division, and an infantry division. They damaged the crops and camped around the city.</p>
<p>The nāga king Apalāla also damaged other crops by causing hail. Because the five hundred hot springs, fountains, lakes, and ponds had dried up, there was a famine. The rest of the water supply was polluted with poison by the neighboring minor kings. Then, as if throwing ash on the wound of Ajātaśatru, who could not bear his pain and was frightened, nonhuman beings took the opportunity to cause an epidemic, and then funeral biers jostled with one another. King Ajātaśatru, his mind confused by the hundreds of losses, was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. Vaidehī asked him, “My son, why are you plunged into grief?”</p>
<p>“Mother, I have suffered hundreds of losses.”</p>
<p>“My son, did I not once tell you, ‘Do not perform disrespectful acts toward the Blessed One.  Since the buddhas, the blessed ones, are concerned about disrespectful acts, the Blessed One will leave Rājagṛha, which is bound to be a loss for us’? That’s why!”</p>
<p>“Mother, what should I do about it?”</p>
<p>“My son, beg the Blessed One for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“Mother, I cannot go into the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“My son, have you not heard that the buddhas, the blessed ones, accept being cut by an adze and being anointed with sandal paste as the same, and have abandoned anger and attachment? If one cut the Blessed One’s arm with an adze and anointed his other arm with gośīrṣacandana, the Blessed One would feel neither attachment nor anger toward him.”</p>
<p>Then King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī,  ordered a man, “Go now to the Blessed One. When you arrive, bow low on my behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say, ‘Honored One, this is a message from Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī: “Honored One, though there is a bad son, there is no bad father. So, may the Blessed One have compassion and come to Rājagṛha. If the Blessed One does not come, the city of Rājagṛha will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.” ’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, and departed.</p>
<p>The man in due course arrived in Śrāvastī and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the man said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, bows low until his forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and asks if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness . . . and living in vigor and comfort.”</p>
<p>“I hope you and Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“Honored One, this is a message from Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī: ‘Honored One, though there is a bad son, there is no bad father. So, may the Blessed One have compassion and come to Rājagṛha. If the Blessed One does not come, the city of Rājagṛha will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the man by remaining silent. Then the man, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent,  departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>Thereafter the Blessed One stayed in Śrāvastī as long as he wished, and then traveled toward Rājagṛha with the community of disciples. In due course, he arrived in the country of Magadha.</p>
<p>By the power of the Blessed One, the gods who send wind dried up the waters that had been polluted with poison. The gods who bring rain filled the land with water of the eight good qualities. The gods brought rain. The gods who have faith in the Buddha expelled the nonhuman beings from Rājagṛha and the epidemic ceased. When the neighboring minor kings heard that the Blessed One had come, they ended their siege of the city and left. Merchants displayed their merchandise. Each craftsman began to work. Merchants and caravan leaders living in each country began to enter Rājagṛha bringing their merchandise. The harvest became abundant. The great state of the Blessed One was proclaimed in wide streets, in small streets, at three-forked roads, and at crossroads. Non-Buddhist ascetics became timid. People were very pleased.</p>
<p>When Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, heard that the Blessed One had come to the country of Magadha, he was pleased, he rejoiced, he was very pleased, he was highly pleased, and he felt happy. He instructed his ministers, “Sirs, today decorate the road for three and a half yojanas and beautify the cities for the sake of the Blessed One. In the whole city of Rājagṛha, remove the stones, pebbles, and gravel, sprinkle sandalwood water, and hang many silk tassels. Set out sweet-smelling censers  and set up parasols and banners. At various intervals make beautiful houses of flowers.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the ministers to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, and they completed everything thoroughly.</p>
<p>Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, with the majesty of a great king and the power of a great king, went to meet the Blessed One by himself along with his army of four divisions.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, who was self-controlled and followed by a self-controlled assembly, who was calm and followed by a calm assembly, who was peaceful and followed by a peaceful assembly, who was excellently self-controlled and followed by an excellently self-controlled assembly, who was an arhat and followed by an assembly of arhats, who was free from desire and followed by an assembly free from desire, who was beautiful and followed by a beautiful assembly, like a bull surrounded by bullocks, like an elephant surrounded by young elephants, like a lion surrounded by a pride of beasts, like a king of haṃsas surrounded by a flock of haṃsas, like a garuḍa surrounded by a flock of birds, like a brahmin surrounded by a group of his disciples, like an excellent physician surrounded by a group of patients, like a hero surrounded by a group of soldiers, like a guide surrounded by a group of visitors, like a caravan leader surrounded by a group of merchants, like a guild head surrounded by his kinsmen, like a minor king surrounded by a group of his ministers, like a wheel-turning king surrounded by his thousand sons, like the moon surrounded by the group of lunar mansions, like the sun surrounded by a thousand lights, like Dhṛtarāṣṭra surrounded by a group of gandharvas, like Virūḍhaka surrounded by a group of kumbhāṇḍas, like Virūpākṣa surrounded by a group of nāgas, like Vaiśravaṇa surrounded by a group of yakṣas, like Vemacitra surrounded by a group of asuras, like Śakra surrounded by the group of Thirty-Three Gods,  like Brahmā surrounded by a group of gods attendant on Brahmā, like the immovable ocean, like a rain cloud, like the best of elephants free from rutting, exhibiting an undisturbed manner and behavior because his senses were completely restrained, fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with a radiance surpassing a thousand suns, and having the ten powers, four types of self-confidence, three unshared applications of mindfulness, and great compassion, arrived at the city of Rājagṛha followed by a large community of monks, Ajātaśatru the king of Magadha and son of Vaidehī, and hundreds of thousands of gods.</p>
<p>At the moment the Blessed One entered Rājagṛha and, with a specific intention, placed his right foot on the threshold of the city gate, the great earth quaked in six ways. This great earth quaked, quaked furiously, and quaked absolutely furiously. It roared, roared furiously, and roared absolutely furiously. When the eastern side rose, the western side sank. When the western side rose, the eastern side sank. When the southern side rose, the northern side sank. When the northern side rose, the southern side sank. When the periphery rose, the middle sank. When the middle rose, the periphery sank. This whole world, along with the interstices between the worlds, was illuminated by a huge light. Gods beat drums in the air. Gods in the sky scattered divine flowers such as utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka; agaru powder, tagara powder, and powder from the tamāla leaf; divine mandārava flowers;  and garments. When the Blessed One came to the city, these wonders occurred. In addition, narrow places became wide, low places rose, and high places sank; elephants roared, horses roared, and bulls also roared; various musical instruments in houses sounded of their own accord without being struck; blind people could see, deaf people could hear, mute people could speak, and those who had other imperfect faculties gained the perfection of each faculty; and the drunk became sober, those who had taken poison recovered from the effect of the poison, those who were angry with each other became friendly, pregnant women bore their children safely, those who had been confined in prison were freed, and those who lacked property obtained property.</p>
<p>Having seen such prosperity, a lay brother spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“In the country where the Lord of the World appears,</p>
<p>There are no crop failures, epidemics, or external attacks,</p>
<p>The gods bring rain, people make merit,</p>
<p>And hundreds of wonders occur there.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One entered Rājagṛha and relieved the people. He then left Rājagṛha and entered the Bamboo Grove.</p>
<p>Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī,  and was then silent. Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, then praised and rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for three months, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One gave his assent to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Then Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from his seat, and departed. The Blessed One with the community of monks was then provided by Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, for three months.</p>
<p>B. The Epidemic in Vaiśālī</p>
<p>After that, the epidemic was eradicated by the gods who had faith in the Buddha; it left Rājagṛha but appeared in a place named Guṃjika. When it entered Vaiśālī, the people of Vaiśālī suffered from the epidemic and funeral biers jostled one another.</p>
<p>There was a brahmin in Vaiśālī named Tomara, who was the chief priest of the country. In a dream, a god living in Vaiśālī said:</p>
<p>“If the Blessed One, the supreme tamer of people to be tamed,</p>
<p>The joy of the lineage of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>Comes to Vaiśālī,</p>
<p>Harm will cease.”</p>
<p>After the night had passed, Tomara said to the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī, “Sirs, I dreamed such-and-such a dream.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, what should we do about it?” they wondered. “Whom shall we send as a messenger to the Blessed One?” They conferred with each other and said, “This chief priest Tomara is himself capable in everything and he loves us. We shall send him.” They said to him, “Go to the Blessed One. When you have arrived, bow low on our behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and then ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness . . . . Then say, ‘Honored One, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: “May the Blessed One come to Vaiśālī. If the Blessed One does not come to Vaiśālī, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” he said, “since Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, has sought to do harm to you and been your enemy for many years, I am afraid he may do harm to me.”</p>
<p>They answered with this verse:</p>
<p>“Even at a time of war against another country,</p>
<p>It is said that messengers are not killed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, nobody will kill you,</p>
<p>Because you are a messenger to the Victor.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the chief priest Tomara performed various rituals that bring good fortune, blessings, and well-being, and in due course arrived in Rājagṛha. After he was fully rested, he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the chief priest Tomara  said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, the people of Vaiśālī bow low until their foreheads touch the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, having no trouble, and living in vigor and comfort.”</p>
<p>“Tomara, I hope you and the people of Vaiśālī are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: ‘May the Blessed One come to Vaiśālī. If the Blessed One does not come to Vaiśālī, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”</p>
<p>“Tomara,” replied the Blessed One, “together with the community of disciples, I am being provided with all the requisites for three months by Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. So, ask the king for permission. If the king permits it, I shall go as you have asked.”</p>
<p>Tomara sent a message to the people of Vaiśālī that the Blessed One had spoken thus. The people of Vaiśālī returned a message: “Then you should go to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. When you arrive, ask on our behalf if Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, having no trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say this: ‘Your Majesty, please permit the Blessed One to come to Vaiśālī. If Your Majesty does not permit it, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’ ”</p>
<p>Then the chief priest Tomara asked himself, “Should I first contact the king, or his ministers?”  He thought, “Some people say, ‘Do not make contact directly. You should contact those who help you contact the person.’ In short, I should contact the ministers.”</p>
<p>And so he did try to contact the ministers. The ministers then inquired of him, “O Chief Priest, for what business have you come?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” he replied, “I came to ask His Majesty a favor for the Blessed One. Please help me.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Come when we call you,” they said.</p>
<p>Thereupon they found an appropriate time and called him. The chief priest Tomara then went to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. When he arrived, he wished Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, victory and long life and sat to one side. When he had sat to one side, the chief priest Tomara said to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, “Your Majesty, the people of Vaiśālī ask whether Your Majesty is free from trouble . . . .”</p>
<p>“Tomara, I hope you and the people of Vaiśālī are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, this is a message from the people of Vaiśālī: ‘Your Majesty, please permit the Blessed One to come to Vaiśālī. If Your Majesty does not permit it, Vaiśālī will soon be uninhabited, retaining only its name.’”</p>
<p>“Tomara,” said the king, “I have long thought, ‘Oh, why shouldn’t the land of Vaiśālī become uninhabited?’ If the land of Vaiśālī becomes uninhabited, it will happen that I obtain without difficulty the very thing for which I have hoped.”</p>
<p>When the king had spoken thus, Tomara departed. The ministers  said, “Your Majesty, does the Blessed One abandon any living being?”</p>
<p>“No, sirs, he does not.”</p>
<p>“Then Your Majesty is performing a disrespectful act toward the Blessed One. Whether Your Majesty permits the Blessed One or not, the Blessed One will go out of compassion for the beings in Vaiśālī.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, I did not know that,” said the king. “Call Tomara back, then.”</p>
<p>They called Tomara back and the king said to him, “Tomara, I promise I will permit the Blessed One to go. I will permit this if the people of Vaiśālī venerate and serve the Blessed One as I do.”</p>
<p>Tomara then sent a message to the people of Vaiśālī: “The king has spoken thus.”</p>
<p>The people said, “While the king has venerated and served the Blessed One only by himself, why would we, who are many, not do so?” They sent a message back: “Ask the Blessed One to come, and we will venerate and serve the Blessed One as a noble one more beautifully than the king did.” Tomara then informed the king of this.</p>
<p>Thereupon Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, I wish to provide the Blessed One together with the community of monks with the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, throughout my life,  but the Blessed One will not permit it out of compassion for other beings. May the Blessed One then assent to my offer of a meal.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed.</p>
<p>Thereupon Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. The next morning he let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>Knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the king held a golden pitcher and asked the Blessed One a favor: “Honored One, the Blessed One has converted a lot of wicked nāgas and wicked yakṣas. Honored One, this nāga king Apalāla has, for a long time, been hostile toward us who are not hostile, adversarial toward us who are not adversarial, and injurious to us who have not been injurious, and he wasted our crops that had just grown. May the Blessed One have compassion and excellently convert the nāga king Apalāla.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, by remaining silent. Thereupon the Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, and departed. When he arrived at the monastery, the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to convert the nāga king  Apalāla in the northern region. There are five advantages of the northern region. What are the five? There are abundant flowers; there are abundant fruits; there is abundant water; there is sufficient almsfood; and there are honest people.” When he had said this, the Blessed One entered the monastery to go into seclusion.</p>
<p>Thereupon Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, ordered that the road from Rājagṛha to the Ganges and the cities in the country of Magadha all be cleaned: all the stones, pebbles, and gravel be removed; sandalwood water be sprinkled; sweet-smelling censers be set out; many silk tassels be hung; and at various intervals beautiful houses made of flowers be prepared. The people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī had the road from the Ganges to Vaiśālī and the cities cleaned more beautifully than he did.</p>
<p>Then in the evening the Blessed One arose from his seclusion and said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Nālandā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>II. Nālandā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Magadha, arrived in Nālandā, and stayed in a mango forest named Prāvārika near Nālandā.</p>
<p>At that time, there lived a wandering mendicant named Reed Merchant, who was old, aged, elderly—a hundred and twenty years old. He was treated with honor, looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man. Now, a god who had once been a friend, companion, relative, and relation of the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant thought, “If I say to the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant,  ‘O ṛṣi, lead now the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One,’ he will never listen to me. Now I will go to him and make him ponder some questions.”</p>
<p>The god then went to the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant. When he arrived, he said to the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant, “O ṛṣi, now accept and ponder these questions from me: How should you recognize a person who pretends to be a friend while he is not in fact a friend? How should you know a friend who loves you as much as himself? For the sake of what should you enter into renunciation? How should you attain freedom from illness? O ṛṣi, hold these questions in your mind, and if someone answers them and thereby pleases you, you should lead the pure life in the presence of that person.” He then disappeared from there.</p>
<p>Then the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant, having accepted and pondered the questions from the god, went to Pūraṇa Kāśyapa. When he arrived, he considered the questions in his mind in front of Pūraṇa Kāśyapa: “How should I recognize a person who pretends to be a friend while he is not in fact a friend? . . . . How should I attain freedom from illness?” Pūraṇa Kāśyapa did not know or understand the questions being considered in the mendicant’s mind, let alone answer them. Then the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant thought, “Pūraṇa Kāśyapa did not know or understand the questions considered in my mind, let alone answer them.”</p>
<p>He went to Maskarī Gośālīputra, Saṃjayī Vairaṭṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, and Nirgrantha Jñātiputra. When he arrived, he considered the questions in his mind in front of Nirgrantha Jñātiputra:  “How should I recognize a person who pretends to be a friend while he is not in fact a friend?” . . . . He thought, “Nirgrantha Jñātiputra did not know or understand the questions considered in my mind, let alone answer them, either.”</p>
<p>Then the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant thought, “What is the use of my going forth under one who cannot answer the questions being considered in my mind? Since my kinsmen have many possessions, I shall now stay at home, enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.” Yet this idea also occurred to him: “Now I shall go to the śramaṇa Gautama.”</p>
<p>When he had departed, he again thought, “For the time being, Pūraṇa Kāśyapa . . . and Nirgrantha Jñātiputra, who are aged śramaṇas and brahmins, did not know or understand the questions being considered in my mind. Needless to say, the śramaṇa Gautama, who is younger and has only recently gone forth, will not either.”</p>
<p>When he had started to turn back, he again thought, “I have heard from my teachers of conduct, who were old, aged, and elderly, former wandering mendicants, that one should not despise a young monk, one should not slight a young monk, since even a young monk can become one who has great force and great power.”</p>
<p>He then went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he considered the questions in his mind in front of the Blessed One: “How should I recognize a person who pretends to be a friend while he is not in fact a friend? . . . . How should I attain freedom from illness?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant’s mind with his own mind,  then at that time spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“One who, condemning his friend in the presence of other people,</p>
<p>Says, ‘He exhausted me,’</p>
<p>And acts with regard to high and low status,</p>
<p>Should be known not to be your friend.</p>
<p>“One who, speaking untrue words</p>
<p>To his friends,</p>
<p>Does not do what he has said</p>
<p>Is also well known by the wise.</p>
<p>“You should know that such a person is a person who pretends to be a friend while he is not in fact a friend. How should you know a friend who loves you as much as himself?</p>
<p>“One who is always shrewd</p>
<p>And watching opportunistically is not your friend.</p>
<p>In this world, one whose mind is equal to yours,</p>
<p>And who is never separated from you by others, is your friend.</p>
<p>“You should know such a person is a friend who loves you as much as himself. For the sake of what should you enter into renunciation?</p>
<p>“To be one who, abandoning completely that to which he had been attached,</p>
<p>Sees the fruits of acts</p>
<p>And meditates on peace,</p>
<p>Which causes pleasure and leads to an exalted status.</p>
<p>“You should meditate, seeking it. How should you attain freedom from illness?</p>
<p>“One who, knowing the taste of</p>
<p>Complete solitude and the taste of peace,</p>
<p>Savors the joy of the Dharma</p>
<p>Becomes one free from illness and sin.</p>
<p>“You will attain freedom from illness in such a way.”</p>
<p>Then the wandering mendicant Reed Merchant thought, “My mind was known by the śramaṇa Gautama’s mind.” He said to the Blessed One, “Gautama, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. Blessed One, I will lead the pure life in the presence of the śramaṇa Gautama.”</p>
<p>The wandering mendicant Reed Merchant went forth and was ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. After having thus gone forth, the venerable . . . became an arhat whose mind had been completely liberated.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Pāṭali Village.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>III. Veṇuyaṣṭikā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, stayed overnight at Veṇuyaṣṭikā, which was a residence of the king. Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, you and I have transmigrated through this difficult course because we did not know, see, comprehend, or realize the four truths of the noble ones. What are the four? You and I have transmigrated . . . because we did not know, see . . . the truth of the noble ones that is suffering. You and I have transmigrated . . . because we did not know, see . . . the truths of the noble ones that are the origination of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering. Since I have cut off desire for existence through reflecting on and comprehending the truth of the noble ones that is suffering, my births have been exhausted and now I will have no further existence. Since I have cut off desire for existence through reflecting on and comprehending the truths of the noble ones that are the origination of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering, my births have been exhausted and now I have no further existence.”</p>
<p>Thus said the Blessed One. Thus said the Sugata. Thus said the Teacher.</p>
<p>“You and I have transmigrated</p>
<p>Through this difficult course</p>
<p>Because we did not see</p>
<p>The four truths of the noble ones as they are.</p>
<p>“Having seen those truths,</p>
<p>I cut off desire for existence</p>
<p>And my births were exhausted.</p>
<p>Now I will have no further lives.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Blessed One, and the monks rejoiced in and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
<p>IV. Pāṭali Village</p>
<p>A. The Sermon at Pāṭali Village</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Pāṭali Village.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Magadha, then arrived in Pāṭali Village. He stayed at the Pāṭalaka Shrine in Pāṭali Village.</p>
<p>When the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Magadha, had arrived in Pāṭali Village and was staying at the Pāṭalaka Shrine, they met together, flocked together, left Pāṭali Village, and went to the Blessed One. When they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One said to the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village, “Brahmins and householders, these five are the faults of being careless. What are the five?</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carelessly, you will lose many possessions. Brahmins and householders, it is the first fault of being careless that, because of living carelessly, you will lose many possessions.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carelessly, also your sinfulness, infamy, and bad name and reputation will be known in all directions. Brahmins and householders,  it is the second fault of being careless that, because of living carelessly, your sinfulness, infamy, and bad name and reputation will be known in all directions.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carelessly, also to whatever assemblies you go, namely, to an assembly of kṣatriyas, to an assembly of brahmins, to an assembly of householders, or to an assembly of śramaṇas, you will go to the assembly being nervous, unhappy, and frightened. Brahmins and householders, it is the third fault of being careless that, because of living carelessly, to whatever assemblies you go . . . being . . . frightened.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carelessly, also you will die full of regret. Brahmins and householders, it is the fourth fault of being careless that, because of living carelessly, you will die full of regret.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carelessly, also after dying in a certain body you will descend to the inferior states, inferior modes of existence, and be born in hell. Brahmins and householders, it is the fifth fault of being careless that, because of living carelessly, after dying in a certain body you will descend to inferior states, inferior modes of existence, and be born in hell.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, these five are the benefits of being careful. What are the five?</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carefully, you will not lose many possessions.  Brahmins and householders, it is the first benefit of being careful that, because of living carefully, you will not lose many possessions.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carefully, also your goodness, fame, and good name and reputation will be known in all directions. Brahmins and householders, it is the second benefit of being careful that, because of living carefully, your goodness, fame, and good name and reputation will be known in all directions.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carefully, also to whatever assemblies you go, namely, to an assembly of kṣatriyas, to an assembly of brahmins, to an assembly of householders, or to an assembly of śramaṇas, you will go to the assembly not nervous but happy and unafraid. Brahmins and householders, it is the third benefit of being careful that, because of living carefully, to whatever assemblies you go . . . and unafraid.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carefully, also you will die without regret. Brahmins and householders, it is the fourth benefit of being careful that, because of living carefully, you will die without regret.</p>
<p>“Brahmins and householders, because of living carefully, also you will ascend from a certain body and be born among the gods in the heavens. Brahmins and householders, it is the fifth benefit of being careful that, because of living carefully, you will ascend from a certain body and  be born among the gods in the heavens.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, please spend the night in our residence.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village by remaining silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>B. The Donation by the Brahmin Varśākāra</p>
<p>The brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, heard that the śramaṇa Gautama, traveling through the country of Magadha, had arrived in Pāṭali Village and was staying at the Pāṭalaka Shrine in Pāṭali Village, and that the brahmins and householders in Pāṭali Village were serving him.  Upon hearing this, he left Pāṭali Village riding an entirely white chariot pulled by mares, carrying a golden water jar with a handle, and surrounded and followed by young brahmins, and he went to see and serve the Blessed One.  Having gone as far as he could go by vehicle, he alighted from the vehicle, entered the park on foot, and went to the Blessed One.  When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side.  When the brahmin had sat down to one side, the Blessed One,  through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted him in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent.  The brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, then rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One Gautama with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, by remaining silent. Then the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, knowing it was not long after the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, had departed, went to the residence. When he arrived, he washed his feet outside the residence, entered, sat on the prepared seat, stretched his back, and focused his mind on a point in front of himself. While the Blessed One was dwelling for the day in the residence, he saw with his divine sight, which is pure and surpasses that of humans, gods of great power covering the ground in Pāṭali Village. Upon seeing this, he arose in the evening from his seclusion, left the residence, and sat  on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks in the shade of the residence. After he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, who have you heard is going to build a city in Pāṭali Village?”</p>
<p>“Honored One, I have heard that it is the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha.”</p>
<p>“Good, good, Ānanda! Ānanda, the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, is wise as if he had consulted the Thirty-Three Gods. Ānanda, when I was dwelling for the day in the residence here, I saw with my divine sight, which is pure and surpasses that of humans, gods of great power covering the ground in Pāṭali Village. Ānanda, wherever gods of great power cover the ground, people of great power intend to live. Wherever gods of middling and average power cover the ground, people of middling and average power intend to live. Ānanda, because in this place gods of great power are covering the ground, people of great power will intend to live in this place. Ānanda, this city of Pāṭaliputra will be the best of places for trading as long as there are noble dwelling places and noble conduct. However, Ānanda, you should know that there will be three types of danger here, namely, the dangers of fire, water, and civil war.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . . Knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the brahmin held a golden pitcher,  sat down in front of the Blessed One, and asked a favor: “O Gautama, please assign the outcome of the merits, the outcome of the virtue, and the roots of happiness that will be generated from this offering to the gods living in Pāṭali for the sake of their everlasting prosperity, benefit, and happiness.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“One who has faith</p>
<p>And venerates the gods</p>
<p>Practices as the Teacher taught,</p>
<p>And he is praised by the buddhas.</p>
<p>“One who is wise and attentive should,</p>
<p>Where he prepares his residence,</p>
<p>Offer a meal to a virtuous one</p>
<p>And thereupon assign the rewards of the offering to the gods.</p>
<p>“Such people will be respected due to their respect</p>
<p>And venerated due to their veneration.</p>
<p>Then the gods will love him</p>
<p>Just as a mother loves a son born from her own womb.</p>
<p>One who is loved by the gods</p>
<p>Will see happiness.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, through talk consistent with the Dharma, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>The brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, then relinquished all the leftovers of the meal and followed the Blessed One. He thought to himself, “I will name the gate of Pāṭali Village through which the Blessed One Gautama leaves ‘Gautama Gate.’ And I will also name the ford where he crosses the Ganges ‘Gautama Ford.’ ”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing the mind of the brahmin Varśākāra, chief minister of Magadha, with his own mind, went through Pāṭali Village  to the north and arrived where the Ganges was located.</p>
<p>C. The Donation of Parasols</p>
<p>Then King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, thought, “Now, I am the very person who must make an effort to venerate the Blessed One.” With this thought in mind, he had five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>The people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī thought, “If this King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, makes an effort to venerate the Blessed One more and more, why should we not make an effort, too?” They also had five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>The nāgas thought, “If these humans make such an effort to venerate the Blessed One more and more, why should we not make an effort, too, even though we nāgas are ones whose bodies are inferior?” They also had five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>The gods attendant on the Four Great Kings thought, “If these humans, who do not understand merit, make such an effort to venerate the Blessed One more and more, why shouldn’t we, who do understand merit, make an effort, too?” They also had five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>The Thirty-Three Gods thought, “If these gods and humans make such an effort to venerate the Blessed One more and more, why should we not make an effort, too?” They also had five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over the Blessed One’s head.</p>
<p>The Blessed One thought,  “I will exercise my magical powers so that they greatly expand their aspiration.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One exercised his magical powers so that each of them thought in their mind, “I am the very person who is raising a parasol over the Blessed One’s head.”</p>
<p>Thus, gods and humans there raised twenty-five hundred parasols over the Blessed One, the Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>D. A Story of a Former Life of the Buddha: King Mahāsudarśana</p>
<p>All the monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause gods and humans to raise twenty-five hundred parasols over the head of the Blessed One, the Completely Awakened One?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Monks, the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself . . . .</p>
<p>“. . .</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there appeared a wheel-turning king named Mahāsudarśana, who had conquered the border regions in the four directions, was a righteous Dharma king, and had attained the seven treasures. The king had ninety-nine sons. Whenever the king went out, he always took all of his sons along. His consorts thought, ‘Since whenever this king goes out, he always takes all of his sons along, we are as good as sonless even though we do have sons. Now let us make it a rule that if one of us conceives a child, she must not inform the king.’</p>
<p>“Later, one of the consorts did conceive a child. She was kept in a secret place by the other consorts, and after eight or  nine months a boy was born. He was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, and attractive, with a golden complexion, his head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete. When he grew up, every consort loved the boy as if he were her own son.</p>
<p>“One day King Mahāsudarśana came back from the eastern continent of Videha preceded by the seven treasures, surrounded by a thousand neighboring minor kings, surrounded also by his ninety-nine sons lined up in the shape of a half-moon, and most beautifully shining with his brilliance like the light of a thousand suns. His newest son, who was on the terrace, saw the king and asked his mother, ‘Mother, who is coming there?’</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, that is your father, King Mahāsudarśana.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, will I become king when he dies?’</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, the king has ninety-nine other sons, and the eldest of them will become king when the king dies. You are the youngest of them.’</p>
<p>“He then requested of her, ‘Mother, if I will not become king when he dies, please allow me to go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O son,’ said all the king’s consorts, ‘do not do that, for we love you as if you were the son of each of us.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, I shall certainly go forth.’</p>
<p>“Knowing he would certainly insist, they said, ‘O son, then we shall allow it with the promise that when you have attained any good qualities, you will inform us.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall do so.’</p>
<p>“Having been given permission by them, he went to a solitary place,  generated the thirty-seven aspects of awakening without any instruction by a preceptor or teacher, and actualized the awakening of a self-awakened one. Now a self-awakened one, he thought, ‘Since I must tell those mothers what I have promised to tell them, now I will go and fulfill my former promise.’ Since such great people do not make demonstrations with words but with their bodies, he began to display miracles in their presence, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike. Since ordinary people tend to be swiftly attracted by magical powers, they bowed down to his feet like trees that had been cut at the roots and asked, ‘O noble one, have you attained these good qualities?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, I have.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O noble one, since you wish for almsfood and we wish for merit, please stay in this park, and we shall in due course offer you almsfood.’</p>
<p>“The self-awakened one assented, and the women offered the self-awakened one almsfood. The self-awakened one thought, ‘Since I have done what is to be done with this purulent body, I will now enter the realm of emancipation without remainder.’</p>
<p>He then soared high into the sky as if a haṃsa king had stretched its wings and displayed miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike, and he entered the realm of peace, which is emancipation without remainder. Thereupon the women piled up pieces of every kind of fragrant wood. Having piled up all the wood, they cremated his body, poured milk on the fire to put it out, and placed the ashes in a golden urn. They built a stūpa for the ashes in the park, adorned it with their necklaces, bracelets,  and various kinds of ornaments, and hung on it parasols, banners, and flags.</p>
<p>“Later, King Mahāsudarśana, surrounded by his consorts, went to the park in the forest where the blossoms of the trees were budding in the spring, and haṃsas, cranes, peacocks, parrots, śārikās, cuckoos, and jīvaṃjīvakas were singing. Wandering around the park, he saw the stūpa of the arhat. He asked a guardian of the park, ‘Hey, what is this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied the guardian, ‘I do not know. But your consorts know what it is.’</p>
<p>“The king then asked his consorts. They threw themselves at his feet and said, ‘Your Majesty, please grant us freedom from the fear of reprisal.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will give you what you want,’ he replied.</p>
<p>“They then explained in detail what had occurred. The king said to them, ‘It was not good of you that you did not tell me when my son longed for kingship. If you had told me, I would have anointed him as king. But I will hang parasols, a crown, and a turban on the stūpa, even though the great one has already been emancipated and has gone.’</p>
<p>“Then he hung parasols, a crown, and a turban on the stūpa of the self-awakened one out of love for his son.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who was King Mahāsudarśana at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of the action performed by me there, namely, my hanging parasols, a crown, and a turban on the stūpa of the self-awakened one out of love for my son, I became a wheel-turning king  twenty-five hundred times. Because of the remains of the action, as a completely awakened one I now had twenty-five hundred parasols, each of which had a hundred spokes, raised over my head by gods and humans. If I had not attained a number of good qualities like these, I would have become a wheel-turning king another twenty-five hundred times. Therefore, I transferred my merit that would mature later so that it would mature and be enjoyed by my disciples. Even if there should be such a serious famine that a droṇa of rice could only be bought for a droṇa of pearls, my disciples will not lack for almsfood.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative. . . . you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Blessed One, and the monks rejoiced in and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
<p>V. The Ganges</p>
<p>Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, had a bridge of boats placed on the river, and the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī also made a bridge of boats for the Blessed One. The nāgas thought, “Since the bodies of nāgas are inferior, let us now have the Blessed One cross the Ganges over a bridge of our expanded hoods.” They then made a bridge with their expanded hoods.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, those of you who wish to cross the Ganges over the bridge of boats of Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, should go over that. Those of you who wish to go over the bridge of boats of the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī should go over that. I,  with the monk Ānanda, will cross the Ganges over the bridge of the expanded hoods of the nāgas.”</p>
<p>At that time some monks went over the bridge of boats of Ajātaśatru, the king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī. Some went over the bridge of boats of the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī. And the Blessed One, with the venerable Ānanda, went over the bridge of the expanded hoods of the nāgas.</p>
<p>Then a lay brother spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“Having built bridges and leaving brooks behind, some cross the ocean.</p>
<p>People construct rafts. The wise ford the river.</p>
<p>The Buddha—Blessed One, Brahmin—who has crossed over the river, stands on dry land.</p>
<p>Monks bathe here. The disciples construct rafts.</p>
<p>“If there is water everywhere,</p>
<p>What need is there for a well?</p>
<p>Having cut off the root of desire,</p>
<p>Who would look for something more to do?”</p>
<p>VI. Mahāpraṇāda</p>
<p>A. The Appearance of King Mahāpraṇāda’s Pillar</p>
<p>The Blessed One saw a place of high elevation, and said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, King Mahāpraṇāda had a divine pillar that was a thousand fathoms high and sixty fathoms wide, made entirely of gold and covered with various jewels. After he had given donations and made merit, he threw it into the Ganges. Do you want to see it?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, it is the right time. Sugata, it is the right time. If the Blessed One draws the pillar up, the monks will see it.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then touched the earth with his hand, which was marked with a chakra, swastika, and nandyāvarta and whose fingers were connected with a web; which had been generated by hundreds of merits; and which comforts those who are frightened.</p>
<p>The nāgas thought,  “For the sake of what did the Blessed One touch the earth?” Having thought this, they understood that he wished to see the pillar. They then raised it, and the monks all gazed at the pillar, save for the venerable Bhaddālin. As he was one of few desires, he went to a solitary place and remained sewing his robes of refuse rags.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, as the pillar is going to sink, grasp its characteristics.” The pillar then sank.</p>
<p>B. The Former Life of the Monk Bhaddālin</p>
<p>The monks asked the Buddha, the Blessed One, “How is it, O Honored One, that while the monks gazed at the pillar, the venerable Bhaddālin, as he is one of few desires, went to a solitary place and remained sewing his robes of refuse rags? Did he do so because he has abandoned desire or because he attended to the pillar before? If it was because he has abandoned desire, there are other people who have also abandoned desire. If it was because he attended to the pillar before, where did he attend to the pillar?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “it was both because he has abandoned desire and because he attended to the pillar before.”</p>
<p>“When in the past did he attend to it?”</p>
<p>“Monks, once there was a king named Praṇāda, who was a friend of Śakra, Lord of the Gods. Although he wished for a son, he was sonless. He was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, and he thought, ‘Though I have accumulated a mass of property, after my death the royal lineage will end since I do not have a son.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra saw him and asked, ‘O my friend, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika,’ the king replied, ‘it is because, though I have accumulated such a mass of property, after my death the royal lineage will end since I do not have a son.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O my friend,’ said Śakra,  ‘you should not be plunged into grief. If some god is destined to die, I shall make him be reborn as your son.’</p>
<p>“It is natural that five omens appear to a god who is destined to die: his garments that have not been worn out become worn out; his garland that has not wilted becomes wilted; a foul odor issues from his body; sweat oozes from his armpits; and he feels uncomfortable on his seat.</p>
<p>“Just then, the five omens appeared to a god. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, said to him, ‘O my friend, enter the womb of King Praṇāda’s chief consort.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika,’ said the god, ‘that is grounds for carelessness. O Kauśika, because kings commit much misconduct, I will, having unlawfully ruled over the kingdom, go to hell, which I do not want.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O my friend, I will remind you,’ Śakra reassured him.</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, gods are careless, since they enjoy much pleasure.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Indeed they are, my friend. But I will remind you.’</p>
<p>“The god entered the womb of King Praṇāda’s chief consort. On the day that he entered the womb, a large crowd raised a cry. After eight or nine months, a boy was born. He was well proportioned . . . and he had a prominent nose. The king’s kinsmen assembled and, wishing to give the baby a name, they said, ‘What name shall we give this boy?’</p>
<p>“The kinsmen said, ‘Since on the day that the boy entered the mother’s womb a large crowd raised a cry (nāda), let us name him Mahāpraṇāda.’</p>
<p>“Thus the boy was named Mahāpraṇāda.  The boy Mahāpraṇāda was entrusted to eight nursemaids . . .  and he became fully learned in eight kinds of analysis, and he also mastered other kinds of analysis and  reading, and became one whose actions are clear.</p>
<p>“ He became fully learned in the various arts and technical skills of kṣatriyas who have been anointed and have attained dominance, mastery, and sovereignty over the kingdom and have conquered vast lands, namely, riding on the neck of an elephant, riding a horse, handling a chariot, handling a sword and a bow and arrow, retreating and advancing, taming elephants, handling a noose, handling a spear, handling a cudgel, clenching the fist, pacing, cutting, tearing, piercing, and the five arts of shooting, namely, shooting from afar, shooting at a sound, shooting at a vital part, shooting without being noticed, and shooting truly.</p>
<p>“It is commonplace that a son’s name is not known while his father is alive. Later, King Praṇāda died and Mahāpraṇāda ascended the throne. After having lawfully ruled over the kingdom for a while, he began to rule over the kingdom unlawfully. Then Śakra said to him, ‘O my friend, did I not, when I assigned you as the son of King Praṇāda, tell you not to rule over the kingdom unlawfully lest you should go to hell?’</p>
<p>“Then the king, having lawfully ruled over the kingdom for a while, again began to rule over the kingdom unlawfully. Again, Śakra said to him, ‘O my friend, did I not, when I assigned you as the son of King Praṇāda, tell you not to rule over the kingdom unlawfully lest you should go to hell?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika,’ replied the king,  ‘since we kings enjoy much pleasure, we quickly forget things through carelessness. Please leave a reminder for me, so when I see it, I will certainly give donations and make merit.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, ordered the god Viśvakarman, ‘O Viśvakarman, go and produce, in the palace of King Mahāpraṇāda, a divine courtyard and a divine pillar that is a thousand fathoms high and sixty fathoms wide, made entirely of gold, and covered with various jewels.’</p>
<p>“The god Viśvakarman then did produce, in the palace of King Mahāpraṇāda, a divine courtyard and a divine pillar that was a thousand fathoms high and sixty fathoms wide, made entirely of gold, and covered with various jewels. King Mahāpraṇāda then had an offering hall built, and appointed Aśoka, his uncle on his mother’s side, as the manager of the pillar.</p>
<p>“Thereupon all the people living on the continent of Jambu gathered to see the pillar. They continued to stare at the pillar even while eating their meals and did not do their own work. As a result, the crops failed and the king’s taxes were not paid. When the ministers presented only a small amount of tax to the king, King Mahāpraṇāda asked them, ‘Sirs, why are you presenting only a small amount of tax?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, all the people living on the continent of Jambu have gathered to see the pillar. They have continued to stare at the pillar even while eating their meals and do not do their own work. Therefore, the crops have failed and the taxes have not been paid.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Destroy the pillar’s offering hall!’ ordered the king.</p>
<p>“Even after they had destroyed it, the people still gathered there as before, bringing food with them, and they continued to stare at the pillar even while eating their meals  and did not do their own work. Since the crops failed, the taxes were not paid. The king asked them, ‘Sirs, why are the taxes dwindling, even though you have destroyed the offering hall?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the ministers responded, ‘the people have still gathered there as before, bringing food with them. They stare at the pillar even while eating their meals and do not do their own work. Therefore, the crops have failed and the taxes are dwindling.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahāpraṇāda, having given donations and made merit, sank the pillar into the Ganges.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was King Mahāpraṇāda’s uncle, Aśoka, was indeed this monk Bhaddālin. And so he once attended to this pillar.”</p>
<p>C. The Prediction of the Appearance of the Buddha Maitreya and the Wheel-Turning King Śaṅkha</p>
<p>“Honored One, on what occasion will this pillar be destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One explained, “in the future, the human lifespan will be eighty thousand years. Among the people whose lifespan is eighty thousand years, there will appear a king named Śaṅkha, a wheel-turning king who is in control of himself and has conquered the border regions in the four directions, a righteous Dharma king who has attained the seven treasures. His seven treasures will be these: the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He will have a thousand sons who will be brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. He will conquer the land entirely, as far as the seashore, without risking harm, without violence, without punishment or weapons, but in accord with the Dharma and impartially.</p>
<p>“King Śaṅkha will have a brahmin named Brahmāyus, who will be chief priest of the country. The brahmin will have a wife named Brahmāvatī. She will, having filled the world with immeasurable love, have a son named Maitreya (Loving). The brahmin Brahmāyus will teach brahmanical mantras to eighty thousand young brahmins. He will entrust the young brahmins to Maitreya, and the young brahmin Maitreya will teach brahmanical mantras to the eighty thousand young brahmins.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the Four Great Kings will bring four great treasures, namely:</p>
<p>“Piṅgala from Kaliṅga,</p>
<p>Pāṇḍuka from Mithilā,</p>
<p>Elāpatra from Gāndhāra,</p>
<p>And Śaṅkha from Vārāṇasī,</p>
<p>“and this pillar, and they will offer them to King Śaṅkha. King Śaṅkha will give them to the brahmin Brahmāyus, the brahmin Brahmāyus to the young brahmin Maitreya, and the young brahmin Maitreya to the young brahmins. Thereupon the young brahmins will break the pillar into pieces and divide the pieces. Then the young brahmin Maitreya, having realized the impermanence of the pillar and experienced grief, will go to the forest. On the very day when he goes to the forest, having filled the world with immeasurable love, he will attain supreme knowledge. His name will be the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya.</p>
<p>“On the very day when the Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya attains supreme knowledge, the seven treasures of King Śaṅkha will disappear. King Śaṅkha will, along with his attendants, eighty thousand minor kings, also go forth, following the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One  Maitreya who himself went forth. His precious woman, Viśākhā, will also go forth along with her eighty thousand female attendants, following the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya who himself went forth. The brahmin Brahmāyus will also go forth along with his attendants, the eighty thousand young brahmins, following the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya who himself went forth.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya, surrounded by ninety-six hundred thousand monks, will go to Mount Kukkuṭapādaka. Because the whole skeleton of the monk Kāśyapa will be there in the mountain, Mount Kukkuṭapādaka will open itself for the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya. Then the Supremely Perfectly Awakened One Maitreya will take the whole skeleton of the monk Kāśyapa with his right hand, place it in his left hand, and teach the Dharma to his disciples: ‘Monks, when the human lifespan was a hundred years, there appeared in the world a teacher called Śākyamuni. Among his disciples, Kāśyapa was said to have been the one who was the best at being content with what he had, being free from avarice, and accomplishing the ascetic practices. He is here. Moreover, after Śākyamuni was completely emancipated, his teachings were collected by this Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“The monks will see the skeleton and experience grief, thinking, ‘How could such a number of good qualities be attained with such a body?’ Through the experience of grief they will actualize the state of an arhat—the ninety-six hundred thousand monks will actualize the state of an arhat and the ascetic practices. Then the pillar will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>D. The Former Lives of the Buddha Maitreya and the Wheel-Turning King Śaṅkha</p>
<p>“O Honored One, by what cause and what condition do the two treasures (a wheel-turning king and a buddha)  appear in the world?”</p>
<p>“It is by the power of an aspiration,” replied the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, where did you make such an aspiration?”</p>
<p>“Monks, once there was a king named Vāsava in the midland region. He ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  His trees were always full of blossoms and fruits, and the gods brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, the harvest was exceedingly abundant.</p>
<p>“In the northern region, there was a king named Dhanasaṃmata.  He ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  His trees were always full of blossoms and fruits, and the gods brought rain at the appropriate times. Therefore, the harvest was exceedingly abundant.</p>
<p>“One day King Vāsava’s chief priest had a son whose crest (śikhā) was naturally ornamented with jewels (ratna). A great celebration at the boy’s birth was held and he was named Ratnaśikhin. Later, having seen the old, the sick, and the dead, he experienced grief and went to the forest. On the very day when he went to the forest, he attained supreme knowledge, and his name became the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin.</p>
<p>“Then one day King Dhanasaṃmata was sitting on a terrace made of jewels, surrounded by his ministers. He asked the ministers, ‘Sirs, is there any other king like me, whose land is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, and in whose land trees are always full of blossoms and fruits,  and the gods bring rain at the appropriate times, and therefore the harvest is exceedingly abundant?’</p>
<p>“People who had come from the midland region to the northern region bearing merchandise said, ‘Your Majesty, there is a king named Vāsava in the midland region.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he heard this, King Dhanasaṃmata found it unbearable. Unable to bear it, he ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, prepare an army consisting of four divisions. I will destroy his land.’</p>
<p>“Then King Dhanasaṃmata, having prepared an army consisting of four divisions, namely, an elephant division, a horse division, a chariot division, and an infantry division, went to the midland region and took up his position on the south bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>“When King Vāsava heard that King Dhanasaṃmata had prepared an army consisting of four divisions, namely, an elephant division, a horse division, a chariot division, and an infantry division, and that he had come to the midland region and taken up his position on the south bank of the Ganges, he also prepared an army consisting of four divisions, namely, an elephant division, a horse division, a chariot division, and an infantry division, and took up his position on the north bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>“The Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin knew that it was the right time to train these two kings and stayed overnight on the bank of the Ganges. Then the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, Śakra, Brahmā, and the other gods understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. Then Śakra, Brahmā, and the other gods  went to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and then they sat down to one side.</p>
<p>“King Dhanasaṃmata saw the vast splendor of light created by the figures of the gods, and he asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, what is this vast splendor of light that has appeared in the land of King Vāsava?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they answered, ‘the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin has appeared in the land of King Vāsava. Śakra, Brahmā, and the other gods have come to see him. Therefore, a vast splendor of light has appeared. He is of great magical power and dignity, and the splendor of light is his dignity.’</p>
<p>“King Dhanasaṃmata then asked, ‘Sirs, what harm can I do to a king in whose land has appeared a human field of merit such as is visited even by Śakra, Brahmā, and the other gods?’</p>
<p>“He sent a messenger to King Vāsava, saying, ‘O my friend, I will not do anything against you. Come here. You are a man with the great power of merit, and in your land is a human field of merit, the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, who is visited by Śakra, Brahmā, and the other gods. I would rather clasp you around the neck and leave so that we will be content with one another.’</p>
<p>“King Vāsava did not trust him. He went to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Vāsava told the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin,  ‘O Honored One, King Dhanasaṃmata sent me a message: “O my friend, I will not do anything against you. Come here. I would rather clasp you around the neck and leave so that we will be content with one another.” What should I do about this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King,’ said the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, ‘go there and it will be good for you.’</p>
<p>“‘Blessed One, should I throw myself at his feet?’</p>
<p>“‘Great King, you must throw yourself at the feet of kings who have a great army.’</p>
<p>“King Vāsava then rose from his seat, bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and departed. He went to King Dhanasaṃmata, and when he arrived, he threw himself at King Dhanasaṃmata’s feet. King Dhanasaṃmata then clasped him around the neck, made peace with him, and departed.</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Vāsava went to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Vāsava asked the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, ‘Honored One, who is the king at whose feet every king throws himself?’</p>
<p>“‘Great King, it is the wheel-turning king.’</p>
<p>“ King Vāsava then rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and said to him,  ‘May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“The Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin assented to King Vāsava by remaining silent. Then King Vāsava, knowing that the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had assented by remaining silent, departed from the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin. Thereupon King Vāsava prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. The next morning he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin know the time by messenger: ‘O Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.’</p>
<p>“Then, early in the morning, the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the dining hall of King Vāsava, followed by the community of monks. When he arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. King Vāsava then knew that the community of monks headed by the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal.  When, with his own hands, he had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl,  the king threw himself at the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin and made this aspiration: ‘O Honored One, may I become a wheel-turning king by this root of merit from my offering.’ Soon after that, he also blew a conch shell (śaṅkha).</p>
<p>“Then the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin said to King Vāsava, ‘Great King, you will become a wheel-turning king named Śaṅkha when the human lifespan is eighty thousand years.’</p>
<p>“Then there was a loud shout. King Dhanasaṃmata heard the shout and asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, there was a shout in the land of King Vāsava. What was it?’</p>
<p>“They investigated it carefully and answered, ‘Your Majesty, because the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin predicted King Vāsava would become a wheel-turning king, the people were pleased and delighted and rejoiced. Hence there was a shout.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Dhanasaṃmata went to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Dhanasaṃmata asked the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, ‘O Honored One, at whose feet does every wheel-turning king throw himself?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, it is the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One.’</p>
<p>“ King Dhanasaṃmata then rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and said, ‘May the Blessed One together with the community of monks  assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“The Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin assented to King Dhanasaṃmata by remaining silent. Then King Dhanasaṃmata, knowing that the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, and then departed from his presence. Thereupon King Dhanasaṃmata prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin know the time by messenger: ‘O Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.’</p>
<p>“Then, early in the morning, the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the dining hall of King Dhanasaṃmata, followed by the community of monks. When he arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. King Dhanasaṃmata then knew that the community of monks headed by the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When, with his own hands, he had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl,  the king threw himself at the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin, filled this whole world with immeasurable love, and made this aspiration: ‘May I become a teacher of the world, a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, by this root of merit from my offering.’</p>
<p>“The Perfectly Awakened One Ratnaśikhin said, ‘Great King, you will become the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly awakened one named Maitreya when the human lifespan is eighty thousand years.’</p>
<p>“Thus, monks, by the power of an aspiration, two treasures will appear in the world at the same time.”</p>
<p>E. The Sermon in Kuṭi Village</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to the village named Kuṭi.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>And so the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Kuṭi Village. He stayed in a śiṃśapā forest to the north of Kuṭi Village. Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, this is moral conduct. This is meditation. This is wisdom. Monks, if you practice moral conduct, your meditation will long endure. If you practice meditation, your wisdom will long endure. If you practice wisdom, your mind will be perfectly liberated from desire, anger, and delusion. A noble disciple whose mind has thus been perfectly liberated will perfectly understand: ‘My defilements have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ ”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Blessed One, and the monks rejoiced in and praised what the Blessed One had said.</p>
<p>F. The Sermon in Nādikā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to *Nādikā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Nādikā. He stayed at the ṛṣi Guṃjika’s abode (Guṃjikāvasatha) in Nādikā.</p>
<p>At that time, an epidemic had broken out among the people of Nādikā, and the lay brother Karkaṭaka had died. Nikaṭa, Kaḍaṅgara, Kātyarṣabha, Cāru, Upacāru, Ariṣṭa, Upāriṣṭa, Bhadra, Subhadra, Yaśas, Yaśodatta, and the lay brother Yaśottara had also died.</p>
<p>Then in the morning many monks dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and entered Nādikā for alms. When the many monks were walking around Nādikā for alms, they heard that an epidemic had broken out among the people of Nādikā and that at that time the lay brother Karkaṭaka had died and Nikaṭa, Kaḍaṅgara, Kātyarṣabha, Cāru, Upacāru, Ariṣṭa, Upāriṣṭa, Bhadra, Subhadra, Yaśas, Yaśodatta, and the lay brother Yaśottara had also died. After hearing this, they walked around Nādikā for alms and then took their meal. After the meal they returned, put their bowls and their robes in order, washed their feet, and went to the Blessed One. When they had gathered, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down, the many monks recounted to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, Blessed One,  in the morning we many monks dressed here, took our bowls and our robes, and entered Nādikā for alms. O Honored One, when we many monks were walking around Nādikā for alms, we heard that an epidemic had broken out among the people here in Nādikā and that at that time the lay brother Karkaṭaka had died and Nikaṭa, Kaḍaṅgara, Kātyarṣabha, Cāru, Upacāru, Ariṣṭa, Upāriṣṭa, Bhadra, Subhadra, Yaśas, Yaśodatta, and the lay brother Yaśottara had also died. Honored One, what are their destinies? What are their next births? What are their destinations?”</p>
<p>“Monks, the lay brother Karkaṭaka, since he had abandoned the five fetters that bind one to lower states, will have a miraculous birth. There he will be completely emancipated and become a never-returner, one who will naturally never return to this world. Nikaṭa, Kaḍaṅgara, Kātyarṣabha, Cāru, Upacāru, Ariṣṭa, Upāriṣṭa, Bhadra, Subhadra, Yaśas, Yaśodatta, and the lay brother Yaśottara, since they too had abandoned the five fetters that bind one to lower states, will also have miraculous births. There they will be completely emancipated and become never-returners, those who will naturally never return to this world.</p>
<p>“Monks, here in Nādikā two hundred and fifty-one lay brothers have died. Since they had also abandoned the five fetters that bind one to lower states, they will have miraculous births. There they will be completely emancipated and become never-returners, those who will naturally never return to this world.</p>
<p>“Monks, here in Nādikā three hundred other lay brothers have died. Since they had abandoned the three fetters and restrained desire, anger, and delusion, they are once-returners, those who will, after returning to this world once more, bring their suffering to an end.</p>
<p>“Monks,  here in the city of Nādikā five hundred and one other lay brothers have died. Since they had abandoned the three fetters, they are stream-enterers, those who will naturally never fall into inferior states, are firmly absorbed in awakening, and will have seven more lives at most. They will be reborn seven times among gods and humans and then bring their suffering to an end.</p>
<p>“Monks, it is scornful of the Tathāgata that you ask the Tathāgata about those who have passed away and died. It does not please the Tathāgata. What wonder is there in the fact that someone who is born will die? The nature of phenomena, the enduring reality of phenomena, the element of phenomena endures whether tathāgatas appear or not. The Tathāgata himself, after having completely known and been completely awakened, explains, teaches, establishes, analyzes, interprets, clarifies, expounds—correctly and completely expounds—the following: Because this exists, that arises; because this has been born, that will be born. Conditioned by ignorance, there are actions; conditioned by actions, there is consciousness; conditioned by consciousness, there are name and form; conditioned by name and form, there are the six sense spheres; conditioned by the six sense spheres, there is contact; conditioned by contact, there is perception; conditioned by perception, there is thirst; conditioned by thirst, there is attachment; conditioned by attachment, there is existence; conditioned by existence, there is birth; and conditioned by birth, there arise old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress. Thus, this whole vast mass of suffering arises.</p>
<p>“If this does not exist, that does not arise; if this has ceased, that will cease. With the cessation of ignorance,  actions cease; with the cessation of actions, consciousness ceases; with the cessation of consciousness, name and form cease; with the cessation of name and form, the six sense spheres cease; with the cessation of the six sense spheres, contact ceases; with the cessation of contact, perception ceases; with the cessation of perception, thirst ceases; with the cessation of thirst, attachment ceases; with the cessation of attachment, existence ceases; with the cessation of existence, birth ceases; and with the cessation of birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress cease. Thus, this whole vast mass of suffering ceases.</p>
<p>“Further, monks, I will teach you a teaching device of the Dharma called mirror of the Dharma. Listen to it well and keep it in mind; I shall teach it.</p>
<p>“What is the teaching device of the Dharma called mirror of the Dharma? To understand and have faith in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha is the teaching device of the Dharma called mirror of the Dharma. Moral conduct pleasing to a noble one is the teaching device of the Dharma called mirror of the Dharma. I said that I would teach you a teaching device of the Dharma called mirror of the Dharma, and this is it.”</p>
<p>G. The Invitation by Āmrapālī</p>
<p>Āmrapālī heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, had arrived in Nādikā, and was staying at the ṛṣi Guṃjika’s abode in Nādikā. When she heard this, Āmrapālī said to her parrot named Pūrṇamukha, who understood human language, “Come, Pūrṇamukha, go to the Blessed One. When you arrive, bow low on my behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say, ‘This is a message from Āmrapālī:  “O Honored One, may the Blessed One have compassion for me and come first to my mango grove when you come to Vaiśālī.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” replied the parrot Pūrṇamukha to Āmrapālī, and he then went to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The boys of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī saw the parrot and said, “Sirs, the parrot flying there is the courtesan’s.” They shot arrows at it, but the arrows fell instead upon the boys themselves. The parrot then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“Even at a time of war against another country,</p>
<p>It is said that messengers are not killed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, nobody will kill me,</p>
<p>Because I am a messenger to the Victor.”</p>
<p>The boys also spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If, by the force of your words, the arrows shot were repulsed,</p>
<p>Needless to say, we will retreat.</p>
<p>Because you are protected by a great magical power,</p>
<p>You should proceed without fear.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the parrot Pūrṇamukha went to the Blessed One. When it arrived, it bowed low until its forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then it said to him, “O Honored One, Āmrapālī bows low until her forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and asks if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness . . . and living in vigor and comfort.”</p>
<p>“Pūrṇamukha, I hope you and Āmrapālī are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“Honored One, this is a message from Āmrapālī: ‘O Honored One, may the Blessed One have compassion on me and come first to my mango grove when you come to Vaiśālī.’”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the parrot Pūrṇamukha by remaining silent. Then the parrot Pūrṇamukha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent,  bowed low until its forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from the Blessed One’s presence. Soon after it had gained faith in the Blessed One and departed, it was killed by a kite and reborn among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings.</p>
<p>It is natural for gods or goddesses to give rise to three thoughts just after birth, namely, where they died, where they were reborn, and by what action. The god observed that he had died in the animal world, that he had been born among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, and that this was because his mind was filled with faith in the Blessed One. Then the god who had once been the parrot Pūrṇamukha thought, “Since it would not be appropriate for me to let any days pass before going to see the Blessed One, by all means I will go to see the Blessed One before any days have passed.”</p>
<p>Having thought this, the god who had once been the parrot then put on untarnished, swinging earrings, adorned himself with a necklace and a half necklace, filled the front part of his garment with divine utpala, padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka, and mandārava flowers, and that night went to the Blessed One, displaying his extremely, exceptionally noble figure. When he arrived, he scattered flowers for the Blessed One and sat down in front of him.  At that time, by the force of the figure of the god who had once been the parrot, a vast display of light filled the entire neighborhood of Nādikā.</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew the thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature of the god who had once been the parrot, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  When the god who had once been the parrot had heard the Dharma, he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and  actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, he spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for me is what has never been done for me by my mother, father, wife, kinsmen and relatives, a king, gods, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, or brahmins. You have pulled me out from the states of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts, placed me among the gods and humans, caused me to leave the course of rebirth far behind, dried up the ocean of blood and tears, liberated me from the mountain of bones, shut the gate to inferior states of existence, and opened the gate to heaven and liberation. With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the god who had once been the parrot rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. Like a merchant who had obtained merchandise, like a farmer who had gotten a bumper crop, like a warrior who had won a battle, like a patient who had been cured of every disease, he went to his house with the same majesty with which he had come into the presence of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>VII. Vaiśālī</p>
<p>A. The Visit of Āmrapālī</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Vaiśālī.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,”  replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>And so the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Vaiśālī, and he stayed in the mango grove in Vaiśālī.</p>
<p>When Āmrapālī heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, had arrived in Vaiśālī and was staying in her own mango grove in Vaiśālī, she adorned herself with every ornament and, surrounded by her female attendants and riding a beautiful vehicle, left Vaiśālī and went to see and serve the Blessed One. Having gone as far as she could go by vehicle, she alighted from the vehicle and entered the park on foot.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One was preaching the Dharma before a hundred monks. The Blessed One saw Āmrapālī from a distance. When he saw her, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Since Āmrapālī is coming, abide with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness. What I have taught is this:</p>
<p>“How does a monk abide with vigor? Here a monk gives rise to diligence, endeavors, makes efforts, grasps his own mind, and exerts himself in order to abandon evil and nonvirtuous states that have arisen. He gives rise to diligence, endeavors, makes efforts, grasps his own mind, and exerts himself in order to prevent evil and nonvirtuous states that have not arisen from arising. He gives rise to diligence, endeavors, makes efforts, grasps his own mind, and exerts himself in order to give rise to virtuous states that have not arisen. He gives  rise to diligence, endeavors, makes efforts, grasps his own mind, and exerts himself in order to maintain virtuous states that have arisen, protect them from ruin, practice them, give rise to them again, and actualize vast wisdom. If so, that monk is called one who abides with vigor.</p>
<p>“How does a monk possess vigilance? Here a monk abides with vigilance in his going back and forth. He abides with vigilance in his watching, observing, bending his body, stretching his body, holding his outer robe, robe, and bowl, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, not sleeping, talking, not talking, sleeping, being tired, and resting. If so, that monk is called one who possesses vigilance.</p>
<p>“How does a monk possess mindfulness? Here a monk, because he abides with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness observing the inner body, has abandoned malice and despair toward the world. Because he abides with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness observing the outer body and the inner and outer body; inner perceptions, outer perceptions, and inner and outer perceptions; the inner mind, the outer mind, and the inner and outer mind; and inner phenomena, outer phenomena, and inner and outer phenomena, he has abandoned malice and despair toward the world. If so, that monk is called one who possesses mindfulness.</p>
<p>“Monks, I said, ‘Since Āmrapālī is coming, abide with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness. What I have taught is this.’ This is it.”</p>
<p>Then Āmrapālī went to the Blessed One. When she arrived, she bowed low until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then she sat down to one side. When she had sat down, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed,  inspired, encouraged, and delighted Āmrapālī. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted her in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent. Then Āmrapālī rose from her seat, draped her upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Āmrapālī by remaining silent. Then Āmrapālī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until her forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>B. The Visit of the Licchavis</p>
<p>When the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, had arrived in Vaiśālī and was staying in the grove of Āmrapālī in Vaiśālī, each of them mounted a chariot or a horse. Some of them prepared horses in blue; blue chariots; blue reins and whips; blue turbans, parasols, and sword sheaths; blue cowries with jeweled sticks, garments, ornaments, and ointments; and attendants in blue. Some of them prepared horses in yellow; yellow chariots; yellow reins and whips; yellow turbans, parasols, and sword sheaths; yellow cowries with jeweled sticks, garments, ornaments, and ointments; and attendants in yellow. Some of them prepared horses in red; red chariots; red reins and whips; red turbans, parasols,  and sword sheaths; red cowries with jeweled sticks, garments, ornaments, and ointments; and attendants in red. Some of them prepared horses in white; white chariots; white reins and whips; white turbans, parasols, and sword sheaths; white cowries with jeweled sticks, garments, ornaments, and ointments; and attendants in white. They left Vaiśālī noisily, speaking loudly, and went to see and serve the Blessed One.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One saw the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī coming from a distance, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, those of you who have not seen the Thirty-Three Gods going to a park should look at the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī. Why? Monks, the Thirty-Three Gods go to a park like these people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī, with magical power like this, with majesty like this, and in vestments like these.”</p>
<p>Having gone as far as they could go by vehicle, they alighted from their vehicles and entered the park on foot. Then the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī went to the Blessed One. After they had gathered, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī. After he had  instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted them in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent.</p>
<p>At that time, a young brahmin named Paiṅgika was sitting in the assembly. This young brahmin Paiṅgika rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “Blessed One, I am inspired. Sugata, I am inspired.”</p>
<p>“Paiṅgika, speak of it,” said the Blessed One. The young brahmin Paiṅgika then spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“The king of Aṅga in jeweled armor,</p>
<p>The lord of Magadha has profited well.</p>
<p>The Buddha, who appeared in his land,</p>
<p>Possesses fame like that of the Himalaya.</p>
<p>“Like a well-grown lotus</p>
<p>Blooming fragrantly in the evening,</p>
<p>Like the sun shining brightly in the sky,</p>
<p>Look at the descendant of Aṅgiras.</p>
<p>“Look at the power of the wisdom of the tathāgatas,</p>
<p>Which is like a fire burning in the night.</p>
<p>He opens our eyes, illuminates,</p>
<p>And resolves the questions of those who approach him.”</p>
<p>The five hundred Licchavis, saying, “The young brahmin Paiṅgika has spoken eloquently. The young brahmin Paiṅgika has spoken eloquently,” gave him five hundred upper robes for his eloquence. The people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī then rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at our house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Vāsiṣṭhas, I have already been invited by Āmrapālī.”</p>
<p>“Honored One,  we have been defeated by that lowly, dimwitted Āmrapālī. And so, though we were unable to come to see and serve the Blessed One first, we will again offer service to the Blessed One and the community of monks.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to them, “Vāsiṣṭhas, it is good that you have said this.” Thereupon the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. They bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and they departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>The young brahmin Paiṅgika remained seated there. As soon as the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī had left, the young brahmin Paiṅgika then rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, here the five hundred Licchavis have given me five hundred upper robes for my eloquence. May the Blessed One have compassion for me and accept the robes.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One had compassion for the young brahmin Paiṅgika and accepted the five hundred upper robes. Thereupon the Blessed One said to the young brahmin Paiṅgika, “When a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one appears in the world, five wonders and marvels will appear in the world. What are the five?</p>
<p>“Paiṅgika, here in the world there appears a teacher who is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. He will teach Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good at the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in wording, distinct, complete, pure, and  immaculate, teaching the pure life. Paiṅgika, this is the first wonder and marvel that appears in the world when a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Some people listen to the Dharma with respect, look up to it, revere it, incline their ears to it attentively while concentrating their minds, and listen to it while focusing their entire mind. Paiṅgika, this is the second wonder and marvel that appears in the world when a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Having listened to the Dharma, some people accomplish the Dharma according to how they have heard it. Paiṅgika, this is the third wonder and marvel that appears in the world when a tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened one appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Having listened to the Dharma, some people are pleased and delighted and attain great virtue, endowed with renunciation. Paiṅgika, this is the fourth wonder and marvel that appears in the world when a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Having listened to the Dharma, some people penetrate with wisdom matters of profound meaning. Paiṅgika, this is the fifth wonder and marvel that appears in the world when a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Paiṅgika, the best people remember what was done and know what was done. They do not waste what was done even to the slightest extent, let alone what was done to a great extent. Therefore, Paiṅgika, you must thus learn to remember what was done and know what was done. You must not waste what was done even to the slightest extent, let alone what was done to a great extent. Paiṅgika, you must learn thus.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the young brahmin Paiṅgika rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed  from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>C. The Sermon to Āmrapālī</p>
<p>Meanwhile Āmrapālī prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After she rose at dawn, she prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “O Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the dining hall of Āmrapālī, followed by the community of monks. When he arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Āmrapālī then knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and with her own hands she served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When, with her own hands, she had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One celebrated the offering provided by Āmrapālī with this celebration:</p>
<p>“If someone is pleased with an offering and people rely on him,</p>
<p>He will win praise and his fame will increase.</p>
<p>When he goes to an assembly without avarice,</p>
<p>He will not be discouraged or frightened.</p>
<p>“Therefore, wise people who desire virtue</p>
<p>Abandon the stain of avarice and present offerings.</p>
<p>They will live among the Thirty-Three Gods for a long time</p>
<p>And enjoy the same fortune as the gods do.</p>
<p>“Having presented offerings and practiced virtue, after death they will</p>
<p>Stroll by their own light in the Nandana Grove of Indra.</p>
<p>There, couples of them will play and amuse themselves,</p>
<p>Enjoying the objects of the five kinds of desires.</p>
<p>Having listened to what the unfettered protector said,</p>
<p>The disciples of the Sugata will be pleased with heaven.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Āmrapālī, and he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>D. The Former Lives of the Licchavis</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī create that matured to cause them to be gods of great power if they were born among gods, to be people of great power if they were born among humans, and now to be compared even with the Thirty-Three Gods?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One said, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the people of the Licchavi clan in Vaiśālī themselves, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach them like a flood, inevitably. Who else but these people would experience the actions that they themselves performed and accumulated? Monks, actions performed and accumulated do not mature in the earth element, the water element, the fire element, or the wind element, which are outside the body. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated like this mature in the aggregates, elements, and sense spheres.</p>
<p>“Even after hundreds of eons,</p>
<p>Actions are never lost.</p>
<p>When the time and conditions are right,</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, who was a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. He stayed near  Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī, with twenty thousand monks who were his attendants.</p>
<p>“At that time there lived five hundred lay brothers in Vārāṇasī. They prepared merchandise to carry across the great ocean, arranged a ship, took to the great ocean in due course, and arrived by means of a tailwind at an island of jewels. Thereupon they filled their ship with jewels and departed. They were driven by the wind to the middle of the great ocean. Dejected and bereft of hope, they made a stūpa out of sand for the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and offered various jewels to it. Thereupon they fell asleep. In their dreams a god said, ‘Do not be frightened but take care, and after seven days a current will come. With the current you will arrive safely at the continent of Jambu.’</p>
<p>“After the night had passed, they discussed this with one another: ‘Sirs, because it is by the force of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa that the god told us not to be frightened, it would not be proper if we took with us the jewels that we offered to the stūpa for the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa.’ They then gathered and made an aspiration: ‘By this root of merit from our performing a service for the supreme human field of merit, the Perfectly Awakened One, the Blessed One Kāśyapa, may we become those of great power if we are born among gods. May we become those of great power if we are born among humans. May we become those to be compared with the Thirty-Three Gods, too, even if we are born among humans.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The five hundred lay brothers were indeed these five hundred people of the Licchavi clan. Because they made  a stūpa for the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa out of sand and offered jewels to it, they were born among people of great power and became those to be compared with the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative; the maturation of entirely positive actions is entirely positive; the maturation of those that are mixed is mixed. Therefore, monks, henceforth you should abandon entirely negative and mixed actions, and you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>E. The End of the Epidemic in Vaiśālī</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go to the city of Vaiśālī, place your foot on the threshold of the city gate, and utter these mantras and these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Visarata visarata visarata visarata</p>
<p>“ ‘The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken. This is the wish of all buddhas. It is the wish of all self-awakened ones. It is the wish of all arhats. It is the wish of all those undergoing training. It is the wish of all disciples. It is the wish of all who speak words of truth. It is the wish of the Dharmas. It is the wish of Kāmeśvara.

<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, and he went to Vaiśālī and, placing his foot on the threshold of the city gate, uttered these mantras and these verses:</p>
<p>“Visarata visarata visarata visarata</p>
<p>“The Buddha, who has compassion for the world, has spoken.  This is the wish of all buddhas. It is the wish of all self-awakened ones. It is the wish of all arhats.

<p>Chapter Four</p>
<p>Summary of Contents:</p>
<p>Veṇu, Middle Village,</p>
<p>Mithilā, Videha,</p>
<p>Sālā, The Well, Bhārgava,</p>
<p>Kāṣāya, Crown of the Head, Kanthaka,</p>
<p>Gośālaka, Pāpā,</p>
<p>And Kuśinagarī, which is the last.</p>
<p>I. Veṇu</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Veṇu Village.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Veṇu Village, and he stayed in a śiṃśapā forest to the north of Veṇu Village. At that time a famine broke out, a calamity in which it became difficult for a beggar to find food. The Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, now here a famine has broken out, a calamity in which it has become difficult for a beggar to find food. Therefore, monks, those of you who have any acquaintances, who have any allies, who have any friends in the villages of Vṛji near Vaiśālī, should enter the rainy-season retreat there.  I will enter the rainy-season retreat, too, in this Veṇu Village with my attendant monk, Ānanda. None of you should want for almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the monks to the Blessed One. And so those who had any acquaintances, who had any allies, who had any friends in the villages of Vṛji near Vaiśālī entered the rainy-season retreat there. The Blessed One entered the rainy-season retreat, too, in that Veṇu Village with his attendant monk, Ānanda.</p>
<p>During the rainy-season retreat, the Blessed One caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness. The Blessed One thought, “I have caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness. However, the community of monks is now dispersed. Since it is not appropriate for me to be completely emancipated while the community of monks is dispersed, I will now remove the pain with vigor, will not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and will abide, having accomplished with my body meditation that is free from outward appearances.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One did remove the pain with vigor, did not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and abided, having accomplished with his body meditation that is free from outward appearances. Thereupon the Blessed One recovered his ability to act and survive.</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then arose from his seclusion in the evening and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One,  “O Honored One, ever since I knew that the Blessed One had caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal illness, my body has lost its bearings, just as if I had taken poison, and I have forgotten the Dharma I had heard. I hope that the Blessed One does not become completely emancipated until he leaves a will for the community of monks.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, if someone thinks, ‘The community of monks is mine. I will teach the community of monks. The community of monks is led by me,’ he would certainly leave a will for the community of monks. However, Ānanda, I never think, ‘The community of monks is mine. I will teach the community of monks. The community of monks is led by me.’ So why would I leave a will for the community of monks? Again, Ānanda, how could the community of monks rely on me? Ānanda, I have taught the Dharma to be practiced always, namely, the four applications of mindfulness, the four right relinquishments, the four bases of magical power, the five faculties and the five powers, the seven limbs of awakening, and the eightfold path of the noble ones.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, the Tathāgata does not have the closed fist of a teacher who keeps secrets that the Tathāgata would want to conceal because it would be undesirable if others knew them. Ānanda, when the Tathāgata caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal disease, I thought, ‘I have caught a grave, unbearable, severe, and potentially fatal disease. However, the community of monks is now dispersed.  Since it would not be appropriate for me to be completely emancipated while the community of monks is dispersed, I will now remove the pain with vigor, will not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and will abide, having accomplished with my body meditation that is free from outward appearances.’</p>
<p>“I did remove the pain with vigor, did not concentrate the mind on any outward appearances, and abided, having accomplished with my body meditation that is free from outward appearances. Then the Tathāgata recovered his ability to act and survive.</p>
<p>“Now, Ānanda, because the Tathāgata has come to be eighty years old, my body has grown old and decrepit, and it persists by depending on its two things. Like an old chariot held together by depending on its two things, because the Tathāgata has come to be eighty years old, my body has grown old and decrepit, and it persists by depending on its two things.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Ānanda, you should not feel sorrow, be disturbed, or lament. That which has been born, has arisen, has been formed, has been produced, and has been accumulated is naturally dependently originated and subject to dispersal. In this regard, how could you find anything imperishable? There is no such thing.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, I have previously taught you that one has to part from, be divided from, be separated from, and lose everything desirable, valuable, agreeable, and pleasant.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Ānanda, whether now or after I am gone, you should rely on the island that is yourself, the refuge that is yourself, the island that is the Dharma, the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges. Why? Ānanda, whether now or after I am gone, those who rely on the island that is themselves, the refuge that is themselves, the island that is the Dharma,  the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges are the best of my disciples who seek to train.</p>
<p>“And so, Ānanda, how should a monk rely on the island that is himself, the refuge that is himself, the island that is the Dharma, the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges? Ānanda, here a monk, observing the inner body, abides with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness and has abandoned malice and despair toward the world. Because, observing the inner body, the outer body, and the inner and outer body; inner perceptions, outer perceptions, and inner and outer perceptions; the inner mind, the outer mind, and the inner and outer mind; and inner phenomena, outer phenomena, and inner and outer phenomena, he abides with vigor, vigilance, and mindfulness and has abandoned malice and despair toward the world. If so, Ānanda, that monk is said to be relying on the island that is himself, the refuge that is himself, the island that is the Dharma, the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges.”</p>
<p>II. Middle Village</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Middle Village.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Then, in a certain place, the Blessed One smiled. It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile, rays of blue, yellow, red, and white light emanate from their mouths. Some of the rays stream downward and some stream upward.</p>
<p>Those rays that stream downward go to the hells of Reviving,  Black Cord, Being Crushed, Scream, Great Scream, Heat, Intense Heat, Incessant, Blisters, Burst Blisters, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Water Lily, Lotus, and Great Lotus. They alight on and cool those in the hot hells and alight on and warm those in the cold hells. Thus, each of the various pains of those beings in hell ceases. When those beings think, “Sirs, have we died here and been reborn elsewhere?” the blessed ones send an emanation to engender their faith. Seeing it, they think, “Sirs, we have not died here and been reborn elsewhere. Each of our various pains ceased on account of the power of this being we have never seen before.” Their minds filled with faith in the emanation, they exhaust the karma that led them to experience the hells and are reborn among gods and humans as vessels for seeing the truths.</p>
<p>Those rays that stream upward go to the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-Three Gods, the gods of Yāma, Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, and Para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin, the gods attendant on Brahmā, and the gods of Brahma­purohita, Mahābrahman, Parīttābha, Apramāṇābha, Ābhāsvara, Parīttaśubha, Apramāṇaśubha, Śubhakṛtsna, Anabhraka, Puṇyaprasava, Bṛhatphala, Abṛha, Atapa, Sudṛśa, Sudarśana, and Akaniṣṭha. They resonate with the words “impermanent,” “subject to suffering,”  “empty,” and “selfless,” and proclaim these two verses:</p>
<p>“Take action! Go forth!</p>
<p>Apply yourself to the Buddha’s teachings!</p>
<p>As an elephant destroys a house made of reeds,</p>
<p>Destroy the army of Death!</p>
<p>“Those who, with great care,</p>
<p>Exert themselves in this Dharma and Vinaya</p>
<p>Abandon the course of rebirth</p>
<p>And bring an end to suffering!”</p>
<p>Then the rays of light, after unfurling through the worlds of the great billionfold universe, later return to the Blessed One. The rays disappear into the space behind the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain actions of the past. They disappear into the space in front of the Blessed One when the Blessed One intends to explain the future. They disappear into the soles of his feet when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth in the hells. They disappear into the heels when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as an animal. They disappear into his big toe when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a hungry ghost. They disappear into his knees when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a human. They disappear into his left palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king of power. They disappear into his right palm when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a wheel-turning king. They disappear into his navel when the Blessed One intends to explain rebirth as a god. They disappear into his mouth when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a disciple. They disappear into the circle of hair between his eyebrows when the Blessed One intends to explain the awakening of a self-awakened one. They disappear into the top of his head when the Blessed One intends to explain complete and perfect awakening.</p>
<p>At that time those rays, after circumambulating the Blessed One three times, disappeared into the top of the Blessed One’s head.  The venerable Ānanda then made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said:</p>
<p>“A mass made brilliant by thousands of colors</p>
<p>Came forth from your mouth,</p>
<p>Like the sun rising,</p>
<p>Shining in every direction.”</p>
<p>Ānanda also spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“One who has become a buddha, the supreme cause in the world,</p>
<p>Free from restlessness, discouragement, and self-satisfaction,</p>
<p>A victor who has subdued enemies,</p>
<p>Not without cause does he flash a smile,</p>
<p>White like a lotus root or a conch shell.</p>
<p>“Therefore, O resolute one, please know when the time is right,</p>
<p>O lord of victors, supreme Muni,</p>
<p>And resolve the doubts of your listeners who desire to hear</p>
<p>With words that are reliable, sublime, and excellent.</p>
<p>“Protectors, perfectly enlightened ones,</p>
<p>Who are steady like the mountains in the middle of the ocean,</p>
<p>Do not smile accidentally.</p>
<p>These many people desire to hear</p>
<p>For what reason the resolute one smiles.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, that is exactly it!” said the Blessed One. Ānanda, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause, without condition. Ānanda, did you see this place?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, Honored One.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, three perfectly awakened ones have dwelt in this place.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then quickly folded his upper robe in four, laid it down, and said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please sit on this prepared seat, and then this place will have been enjoyed by four perfectly awakened ones.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat. After sitting for a moment, he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to the city of Mithilā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>III. Mithilā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Videha, arrived at Mithilā.  He stayed in the mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā.</p>
<p>Then, in a certain place the Blessed One smiled. The venerable Ānanda saw the Blessed One smile, and having seen that, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause, without condition. What, then, is the cause and condition for the Honored One’s, the Blessed One’s smile?”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, that is exactly it! Ānanda, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause, without condition. Ānanda, once people’s lifespans were eighty thousand years long. This continent of Jambu of people whose lifespans were eighty thousand years long was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. Its villages, towns, provinces, and royal palaces were so close that a rooster could fly from one to the next. The people whose lifespans were eighty thousand years long experienced these kinds of physical harm: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, desire, loss of appetite, and old age. The daughters of the people whose lifespans were eighty thousand years long were given to their grooms at the age of five hundred just as today’s daughters are given at the age of fifteen or sixteen.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, when people’s lifespans were eighty thousand years long, there appeared a king named Mahādeva, a wheel-turning king who had conquered the border regions in the four directions, a righteous Dharma king who had obtained the seven treasures. His seven treasures were as follows: the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He also had a thousand sons who were brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who would defeat the enemy’s army. He conquered the land entirely, as far as the seashore, without risking harm, without violence, without punishment or weapons, but in accord with the Dharma and impartially.</p>
<p>“Then, when the barber who used to cut King Mahādeva’s hair and beard was arranging the king’s hair and beard, the king gave him an order: ‘When you find a white hair growing on my head, tell me, for it is a divine messenger.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber to King Mahādeva.</p>
<p>“Then one day the barber, arranging King Mahādeva’s hair and beard, did find white hairs growing on King Mahādeva’s head and he realized that a divine messenger had appeared. Having found them, he said to King Mahādeva, ‘Your Majesty, please be informed that white hairs are growing on your head and thus a divine messenger has appeared.’</p>
<p>“The king gave him another order: ‘Gently pull those white hairs out without cutting them, and place them in my palm.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber to King Mahādeva, and he gently pulled the white hairs out with a pair of golden tweezers, without cutting them, and placed them in King Mahādeva’s palm.</p>
<p>“Then King Mahādeva, holding the white hairs in both his hands, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Now there grow on my head</p>
<p>Hairs that plunder youth.</p>
<p>Since the divine messenger has appeared,</p>
<p>It is time for me to go forth.</p>
<p>“ ‘Since I have already enjoyed human desires, it is time for me to seek divine desires. Now I will put my eldest son upon the throne and lead the pure life of a royal ṛṣi.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahādeva summoned his son by messenger and said, ‘Understand, my son,  that white hairs are growing on my head and thus a divine messenger has appeared. Since I have enjoyed human desires, it is time for me to seek divine desires. I will now put you upon the throne and lead the pure life of a royal ṛṣi. My son, I will entrust you with the land as far as the seashore, so you should protect it lawfully, not unlawfully. If someone’s conduct is unlawful or a mixture of lawful and unlawful, do not let him live in your country.</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, when you too find a white hair growing on your head and a divine messenger has thus appeared, you should put your eldest son upon the throne and lead the pure life of a royal ṛṣi, too. Thus, my son, you should complete this virtuous and sure path introduced by me and you should not break the tradition. Do not be an inferi or man.</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, he who does not allow such a virtuous and sure path of good men born to a noble lineage to increase, once introduced, will be the one who breaks their tradition and be an inferior man among them. Therefore, I now said, “Complete such a virtuous and sure path of good men born to a noble lineage introduced by me. You should not break the tradition. Do not be an inferior man.” ’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahādeva put his eldest son upon the throne and led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in the mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, the eldest son whom King Mahādeva put upon the throne was also named Mahādeva, a wheel-turning king who had conquered the border regions in the four directions . . . . Then, when the barber who used to cut King Mahādeva’s hair and beard was arranging . . . . ‘Do not be an inferior man.’  Thereupon King Mahādeva put his eldest son upon the throne and led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in the mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, his son, grandson, great-grandson, great-great-grandson, and so on, followed likewise, and eighty-four thousand Mahādevas led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in this very mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā.</p>
<p>“The last of the line was a king named Nimi, a righteous Dharma king, a great king who abided in the Dharma. With his consort, sons, ministers, army, citizens, and provincial dwellers, he practiced the Dharma, gave donations, made merit, abided in abstinence, and practiced moral conduct correctly.</p>
<p>“At that time, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, praised the king in the presence of the Thirty-Three Gods, who were sitting together in the divine meeting hall Sudharmā: ‘O my friends, the people of Videha have attained a great boon, for Nimi, the king of the people of Videha, is a righteous Dharma king, a great king who abides in the Dharma. He, with his consort . . . practices moral conduct correctly. O my friends, do you want to see King Nimi?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, we sincerely wish to do so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, my friends, you wait here. I will see King Nimi briefly.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, disappeared from the Thirty-Three Gods’ divine meeting hall Sudharmā, as quickly as a strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his stretched arm, and sat in King Nimi’s palace in Mithilā. He said, ‘O Nimi, you  have attained a great boon, for the Thirty-Three Gods, sitting together in the divine meeting hall Sudharmā, have praised you: “O my friends, the people of Videha . . . . He . . . practices moral conduct correctly.” O Nimi, do you want to go see the Thirty-Three Gods?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, I do wish to go see the Thirty-Three Gods.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, Nimi, wait here. I will shortly send you a chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses. You should ride in it and come without fear.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall do so,’ replied King Nimi to Śakra, Lord of the Gods.</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, went to the Thirty-Three Gods and ordered Mātali, the charioteer, ‘Mātali, go and very quickly prepare a chariot with a thousand fine horses. Go to King Nimi and say, “O Nimi, this is the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses sent to you by Śakra, Lord of the Gods. Ride in it and come without fear.” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, what you said is excellent,’ replied the charioteer Mātali to Śakra, Lord of the Gods. He very quickly prepared a chariot with a thousand fine horses and went to King Nimi. Upon his arrival, he said, ‘O Nimi, this is the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses sent to you by Śakra, Lord of the Gods. Ride in it and come without fear.’</p>
<p>“Ānanda, King Nimi did ride the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses without fear. Then the charioteer Mātali asked King Nimi, ‘O Nimi, along which side shall I drive your chariot, the side where beings of evil actions experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous actions, or the side where beings of virtuous actions experience  the maturation of virtuous actions?’</p>
<p>“ ‘In this case, Mātali, drive the chariot in a way that will enable me to see both, the side where beings of evil actions experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous actions and the side where beings of virtuous actions experience the maturation of virtuous actions.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the charioteer Mātali drove King Nimi’s chariot in a way that enabled King Nimi to see both, the side where beings of evil actions experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous actions and the side where beings of virtuous actions experience the maturation of virtuous actions.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, King Nimi went to the Thirty-Three Gods and sat in the Thirty-Three Gods’ divine meeting hall Sudharmā. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, offered half of his seat to King Nimi. King Nimi and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, sat on the two halves of the same seat.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, when King Nimi and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, sat on the two halves of the same seat, there was no difference, no distinction, and no contrast between them, except that Śakra, Lord of the Gods, did not blink his eyes.</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, said to King Nimi, ‘O Nimi, you should stay here. Nimi, amuse yourself. Play, amuse yourself, and enjoy yourself, enjoying the objects of the five kinds of desires.’</p>
<p>“At that time, King Nimi spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘A place that is</p>
<p>Under the rule of others</p>
<p>Is like a vessel and a chariot</p>
<p>Borrowed only for a while.</p>
<p>“ ‘I will return to Mithilā</p>
<p>And perform many good deeds.</p>
<p>Having made merit and attained prosperity,</p>
<p>I will go to heaven.’</p>
<p>“Ānanda, if you think that the one who was at that time, on that occasion, King Mahādeva, who entered that virtuous and sure path, and after whose entrance onto that virtuous and sure path eighty-four thousand Mahādevas led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in this very mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā, was someone else, you should think otherwise. Why?</p>
<p>“Ānanda, I myself was at that time, on that occasion, King Mahādeva, who introduced that virtuous and sure path, after whose introduction of that virtuous and sure path eighty-four thousand Mahādevas led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in this very mango grove of Mahādeva in Mithilā. Why?</p>
<p>“Ānanda, at that time I had desire, anger, and delusion. I had not been liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress. I had not been liberated from suffering,” said the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, now I, after appearing in this world as a teacher, a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, a world-knowing, supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one, have become free from desire, anger, and delusion. Thus I have been liberated from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress,” said the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, now I, depending on that virtuous and sure path introduced by me, will liberate beings, who are by nature subject to birth, from being by nature subject to birth. I will liberate beings, who are by nature subject to old age, illness, death,  sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress, from being by nature subject to . . . distress. What is that virtuous and sure path onto which I entered, on which I depended, and by which I will liberate beings, who are by nature subject to birth . . . distress, from being by nature subject to . . . distress? It is the eightfold path of the noble ones, namely, right view, right thought, right speech, right behavior, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right meditation. This is that virtuous and sure path onto which I entered, on which I depended, and by which I will liberate beings, who are by nature subject to birth . . . distress, from being by nature subject to . . . distress.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, you should also thus complete this virtuous and sure path introduced by me and you should not break the tradition. Do not be an inferior man.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, he who does not allow such a virtuous and sure path of good disciples born to a noble lineage to increase, once introduced, will be the one who breaks their tradition and an inferior man among them. Therefore, I said, ‘Complete such a virtuous and sure path of good disciples born to a noble lineage that has been introduced by me. Do not break the tradition. Do not be an inferior man.’ ”</p>
<p>IV. Videha</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Videha.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, having arrived in Videha, smiled  in a certain place in Videha . . . the seat of four buddhas . . . . After sitting for a moment, he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Sālā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>V. Sālā</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Sālā and stayed near a village of brahmins there. Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Sālā for alms.</p>
<p>Māra the Evil One then had a thought: “This śramaṇa Gautama stayed near a village of brahmins in Sālā. Early in the morning he dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Sālā for alms. Now I will exercise my magical power over the brahmins and householders in Sālā so that after the śramaṇa Gautama has entered Sālā for alms, carrying his washed bowl with him, he will return with his bowl as it is, without getting even a scrap of food.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Māra the Evil One exercised his magical power over the brahmins and householders in Sālā so that after the Blessed One entered Sālā for alms, carrying his washed bowl with him, he would return with his bowl as it was, without getting even a scrap of food. Māra the Evil One then transformed himself into a young brahmin, followed the Blessed One, and said, “O śramaṇa, O śramaṇa, did you not even get a scrap of food?”</p>
<p>“Ah,” thought the Blessed One, “this one who is coming is Māra the Evil One. He is causing a disturbance.”</p>
<p>Knowing this, he spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“Through despising the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>You accumulated great demerit.</p>
<p>Buddhas are difficult to surpass.</p>
<p>Evil One, do you not know that?”</p>
<p>Māra the Evil One said, “Śramaṇa, then go to Sālā for alms again, and I will try to ensure that you get alms.”</p>
<p>Then, at that time, the Blessed One spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“There is nothing for me to take possession of.</p>
<p>Ah, I abide in utter bliss.</p>
<p>Like the gods of Clear Light,</p>
<p>I eat pleasure as food.</p>
<p>“There is nothing for me to take possession of.</p>
<p>Ah, I abide in utter bliss.</p>
<p>Since I do not rely on the false view of individuality,</p>
<p>I eat pleasure as food.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Māra the Evil One thought, “Śramaṇa Gautama knows my mind.” Knowing this, he disappeared from that very place in pain, despair, and regret.</p>
<p>VI. The Well</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Where There Is a Well.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Soon after the Blessed One arrived at the place called Where There Is a Well.</p>
<p>In Where There Is a Well, a woman went to the well, carrying with her a rope and pitcher. A man followed her, entirely possessed by passion for her. Since she was also extremely passionate about him, the two of them went to the well together, embracing each other. Her little son also went to the well, following her. Then, preoccupied by the man, she thought, “I will throw the pitcher into the well,” and, tying the rope around her little son’s neck, threw him into the well. The child died.</p>
<p>She then heard a verse that had not been heard before:</p>
<p>“Desire, I know your root.</p>
<p>Desire grows from thought.</p>
<p>If I do not think of you,</p>
<p>Then you do not arise in me.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One was also walking along the same path, and he said to the venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, bear this verse in mind. This verse was spoken by a perfectly awakened one of the past. Since it has come into the hands of an ordinary person, it is not bright, clear, or vivid.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One added, “I see nothing that changes as quickly as this mind.”</p>
<p>The woman, out of sorrow for her son, threw herself at the feet of the Blessed One. The Blessed One knew her thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her.  When she had heard the Dharma, the woman leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for me is what has never been done for me by my mother, my father, a king, gods, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, brahmins, my husband, or my kinsmen or relatives. Relying on a good spiritual friend, the Blessed One, I have shut the gate to inferior states of existence and opened the gate to heaven and liberation; pulled myself out from the states of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts and placed myself among the gods and humans; left the course of rebirth far behind; dried up the ocean of blood and tears; and been liberated the mountain of bones. With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One,  the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay sister. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>VII. Bhārgava</p>
<p>In a certain place, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, when I was a bodhisattva, in this place I was given an invitation by the ṛṣi Bhārgava with a seat, roots, and fruits.”</p>
<p>VIII. Kāṣāya</p>
<p>Again, in a certain place the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, when I was a bodhisattva, I was in despair over old age, and so forth, and in this very place I gave my garment made in Kāśi to Śakra, Lord of the Gods, who was dressed as a hunter, and received saffron (kāṣāya) robes in return. Devout brahmins and householders built a shrine called Acceptance of the Saffron Robes. Today, there are monks who still worship at the shrine there. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, having taken the garment made in Kāśi to the Thirty-Three Gods and placed it among them, held a festival for the garment made in Kāśi. Today the Thirty-Three Gods still worship it.”</p>
<p>IX. Crown of the Head</p>
<p>Again, in a certain place the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, when I was a bodhisattva, in this place I cut my hair with a sword as if it were a blue utpala petal, and threw the hair up in the air. Devout brahmins and householders built a shrine called Acceptance of the Hair. Today, there are monks who still worship at the shrine there. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, having taken the hair to the Thirty-Three Gods and placed it among them, held a festival for the hair knot. Today the Thirty-Three Gods still worship it.”</p>
<p>X. Kanthaka</p>
<p>Again, in a certain place the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, Kanthaka, the king of horses, led by Chandaka, turned back from this place. Devout brahmins and  householders built a shrine called Kanthaka’s Return. Today, there are monks who still worship at the shrine there.”</p>
<p>XI. Gośālaka</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in the country of Gośālaka, and then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, Chandaka, the son of a noble family, was born and grew up here in Gośālaka.”</p>
<p>XII. Pāpā</p>
<p>The Blessed One then arrived in Pāpā. When the people of the Malla clan in Pāpā heard that the Blessed One had arrived in Pāpā, the elder members said, “The young men should clean up the road. We will clean up the city.”</p>
<p>Then, when the young men began to clean up the road, they saw a huge rock. They attempted to remove it, but they were unable to. The Blessed One also came to that place and asked them, “Vāsiṣṭhas, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“We are cleaning up the road for the Blessed One, but we cannot remove this huge rock.”</p>
<p>“In that case, shall I remove it?” asked he Blessed One.</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, please remove it.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One lifted the huge rock into the air using his right big toe. When he threw it up and out of sight, the people of the Malla clan were frightened at the sound it caused. The Blessed One said, “Vāsiṣṭhas, do not be frightened.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One smashed the rock into pieces with his power of meditation, and dust fell all around. The people of the Malla clan asked, “O Blessed One, where does this dust fall from?”</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata smashed the rock into pieces,” replied the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“It isn’t good that the Blessed One did that.”</p>
<p>“Shall I put the pieces back together?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, please put the pieces back together.”</p>
<p>Then, the Blessed One put the pieces back together with the power of dedication and set the rock in the same place as before. The Blessed One sat upon it, too. The five hundred people of the Malla clan also gathered there and asked, “O Blessed One, with what power did the Blessed One throw the huge rock up into the air?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas,” answered the Blessed One, “with the power generated from my father and mother.”</p>
<p>They asked, “With what power did you smash the rock into pieces?”</p>
<p>“With the power of meditation,” answered the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“With what power did you put it back together?”</p>
<p>“With the power of dedication.”</p>
<p>“How great is the Blessed One’s power generated from his father and mother?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, the power of ten men equals the power of an average ox. The power of ten average oxen equals the power of a blue wild ox. The power of ten blue wild oxen equals the power of an elephant calf. The power of ten elephant calves equals the power of a cow elephant. The power of ten cow elephants equals the power of an average bull elephant. The power of ten average bull elephants equals the power of a tuskless elephant. The power of ten tuskless elephants equals the power of a blue elephant. The power of ten blue elephants equals the power of a yellow elephant. The power of ten yellow elephants equals the power of a red elephant. The power of ten red elephants equals the power of a white elephant. The power of ten white elephants equals the power of an elephant from Mount Vindhya. The power of ten elephants from Mount Vindhya equals the power of a rutting elephant. The power of ten rutting elephants equals the power of a nagna (champion). The power of ten nagnas equals the power of a great nagna. The power of ten great nagnas equals the power of  a praskandin (aggressive man). The power of ten praskandins equals the power of a cāṇūra (wrestler). The power of ten cāṇūras equals one half of the power of Nārāyaṇa. Two times half the power of Nārāyaṇa is the power of Nārāyaṇa. This much power is in each joint of a tathāgata. Vāsiṣṭhas, thus tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones have a great mass of the power of Nārāyaṇa.”</p>
<p>A Section Index:</p>
<p>Man, ox, wild ox, elephant calf,</p>
<p>Cow elephant, average elephant, tuskless elephant, elephants of four colors,</p>
<p>Elephant from Mount Vindhya, rutting elephant, two types of nagnas, praskandin, cāṇūra, and the power of two Nārāyaṇas.</p>
<p>“If this power of Nārāyaṇa is the power of a tathāgata generated from his father and mother, O Honored One, is there any other power besides the power generated from his father and mother and the powers of meditation and dedication?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, there is. It is called the power of merit. Vāsiṣṭhas, because the Tathāgata has the power of merit, having defeated Māra and his host of three hundred sixty million bhūtas, he attained supreme knowledge under the Bodhi tree.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, is there any other power besides the power generated from his father and mother and the powers of meditation, dedication, and merit?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, there is. It is called the power of knowledge. Since the Tathāgata has the power of knowledge, he abandoned the mass of defilements that had been accumulated since beginningless time and drove it away.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, is there any other power besides the power generated from his father and mother and the powers of meditation, dedication, merit,  and knowledge?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, there is. It is called magical power. Vāsiṣṭhas, because the Tathāgata has magical power, he destroyed the self-confidence of the six teachers, such as Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, who prided themselves on being perfectly awakened ones when they were actually not.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, is there any other power besides the power generated from his father and mother and the powers of meditation, dedication, merit, knowledge, and magical power?”</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, there is. It is called the power of impermanence. Vāsiṣṭhas, because the Tathāgata has the power of impermanence, all of his powers—the power generated from his father and mother and the powers of meditation, dedication, merit, knowledge, and magical power—fade between a pair of sāla trees.”</p>
<p>He also spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“With all the powers of knowledge and merit,</p>
<p>And the magical and physical powers,</p>
<p>I admit that impermanence, which surpasses my brilliance,</p>
<p>Has greater power.</p>
<p>“He whose body abides like the golden peak of the king of mountains</p>
<p>Is thus defeated and destroyed by the splendor of impermanence.</p>
<p>Wise people should know that impermanence is truly powerful,</p>
<p>And they should achieve that which impermanence does not overcome.</p>
<p>“O Vāsiṣṭhas, see how people today are inferior to the people of long ago in terms of lifespan, figure, power, and wealth. This rock was  an exercise stone of people in the first eon. Even the impression of a hand is visible on it.”</p>
<p>They were quite astonished by this and lost their conceit about their own power. The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivities, dispositions, and natures, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them. When they had heard the Dharma, they leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, they spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what you have done for us is what has never been done for us by our mothers, our fathers, a king, gods, ancestral spirits, śramaṇas or brahmins, our wives, or our kinsmen or relatives. Relying on a good spiritual friend, the Blessed One, we have pulled ourselves out from the states of hell, animals, and hungry ghosts; placed ourselves among the gods and humans; and left the course of rebirth far behind. With the vajra of knowledge we have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, we have been exalted, truly exalted. Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept us as lay brothers. From today onward, we embrace our faith as ones who seek refuge throughout our life.”</p>
<p>XIII. Kuśinagarī</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Kuśinagarī.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,”  replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, without going to Pāpā, traveled to Kuśinagarī, and in due course he arrived there. The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, here in this Kuśinagarī the Tathāgata will soon be completely emancipated.”</p>
<p>Chapter Five</p>
<p>Summary of Contents:</p>
<p>The Axe, Devadṛśa, Lumbinī,</p>
<p>Kapila, Where There Is Cotton,</p>
<p>Kanakamuni, Kārṣaka, A Robe,</p>
<p>Bath, Sikatin. These are the group of ten.</p>
<p>I. The Axe</p>
<p>The Blessed One stayed in Kalmāṣadamya, a village of the people of Kuru. At that time the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, having known and seen that defilements had been exhausted, I said . . . .” (Here the Sūtra of the Parable of the Axe in the section on the aggregates in the Saṃyuktāgama is to be recited in detail).</p>
<p>II. Devadṛśa</p>
<p>The Blessed One then arrived at Devadṛśa and there said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this Devadṛśa, in this very place, Suprabuddha Śākya was born and grew up.”</p>
<p>III. Lumbinī</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Lumbinī and there said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this forest of Lumbinī, as soon as I was born, I took seven steps without support from anyone, looked in the four directions, and said, ‘This is my last birth.’</p>
<p>IV. Kapila</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in Kapilavastu and there said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this Kapilavastu, in this very place, King Śuddhodana was born and grew up.</p>
<p>V. Where There Is Cotton</p>
<p>The Blessed One then arrived at a place called Where There Is Cotton. Thereupon the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, I will teach you about attendants who oppose the Dharma and those who follow it.  Listen well and keep this in mind; I shall teach it.</p>
<p>“What is an attendant who is opposed to the Dharma? The attendant who proceeds because of desire, anger, delusion, and fear is called an attendant who is opposed to the Dharma.</p>
<p>“What is an attendant who follows the Dharma? The attendant who does not proceed because of desire, anger, delusion, or fear is called an attendant who follows the Dharma.</p>
<p>“Monks, I said to you, ‘I will teach you about attendants who oppose the Dharma and those who follow it.’ This is it.”</p>
<p>VI. Kanakamuni</p>
<p>When he arrived at Koṇaka Village, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this Koṇaka Village, the Perfectly Awakened One Kanakamuni was born. He was also completely emancipated in this very place.</p>
<p>VII. Kārṣaka</p>
<p>When he arrived at Kārṣaka Village, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, when I was a bodhisattva, having seen the work of my father Śuddhodana in this Kārṣaka Village, I entered the first dhyāna, which is similar to the state without defilement, in the shade of a Jambū tree.</p>
<p>VIII. A Robe</p>
<p>Again, in a certain place, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, a robe of the Perfectly Awakened One Kanakamuni was spread in this place.”</p>
<p>IX. Bath</p>
<p>When he arrived at a village called Bath, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, the Perfectly Awakened One Kanakamuni bathed in this Bath Village. Therefore the name of this place became ‘Village of Bath.’ ”</p>
<p>X. Sikatin</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in Sikatin. In Sikatin . . . (The Sūtra of the Parable of Pole Climbing in the section of the path is abbreviated here).</p>

<p>I. Icchānaṅgalā</p>
<p>In Icchānaṅgalā, the Blessed One stayed in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest. At one point the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, I will go into seclusion here for three months. No monks should come to me except when someone brings me almsfood or when it is the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days.”</p>
<p>And so the Blessed One did go into seclusion there for three months. No monks came to him except when a monk brought him almsfood or when it was the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days. Thereupon the Blessed One, having spent the three months, sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, if non-Buddhist ascetics or wandering mendicants approach you and ask, ‘In what state did the śramaṇa Gautama go into seclusion here for three months?’ you should answer those who ask, ‘He dwelt in breathing in and breathing out.’</p>
<p>“Why? Monks, I was in seclusion here for three months in the state of being mindful of breathing in and breathing out. Whenever I breathed in, I knew that I was breathing in exactly as I was. Whenever I breathed out, I knew that I was breathing out exactly as I was. While perfectly aware of long and short breaths and the whole body, whenever I breathed in, I knew, while perfectly aware of the whole body, that I was breathing in exactly as I was. While perfectly aware of the whole body,  whenever I breathed out, I knew, while perfectly aware of the whole body, that I was breathing out exactly as I was. Having made supple the bodily formations, whenever I breathed in and, having made supple the bodily formations, I breathed out, I knew that I breathed in and breathed out exactly as I did . . . . I knew, observing cessation, that I breathed out exactly as I did.</p>
<p>“Monks, about this I thought, ‘Since this is a coarse and fabricated state, now I will go beyond that state and abandon it, and abide in subtler and subtler states again and again.’ Having gone beyond that state and abandoned it, I abided in these subtler and subtler states again and again.</p>
<p>“Thereupon three gods came to me. When they arrived, one of the gods said, ‘The śramaṇa Gautama is dead.’</p>
<p>“The second god said, ‘He is not dead but dying.’</p>
<p>“The third god said, ‘He is neither dead nor dying; the state of arhats is tranquil like this.’</p>
<p>“Monks, suppose one correctly speaks of the state of a noble one, the state of a god, the state of Brahmā, and the state of a practitioner having completed the training, which are the same as the state of the Tathāgata. Practitioners undergoing training enter into that state in order to obtain what they have not obtained, realize what they have not realized, and actualize what they have not actualized. Practitioners having completed the training enter into that state in order to abide in happiness in this present life.</p>
<p>“When one thus speaks correctly,  one speaks of abiding in mindfulness of breathing in and breathing out. Why? Monks, abiding in mindfulness of breathing in and breathing out is the state of a noble one . . . . Practitioners having completed the training enter into that state in order to abide in happiness in this present life.”</p>
<p>II. Utkaṭā</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and stayed in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.</p>
<p>At that time a brahmin named Pauṣkarasāri was given tribute along with gifts for brahmins in the form of roots, trees, and water by King Prasenajit of Kosala, and he was enjoying the wealth of the whole of Utkaṭā. There was a disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri named Ambāṣṭha, who was learned and spoke clearly and fluently. He was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins, who were also disciples of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri.</p>
<p>The brahmin Pauṣkarasāri heard thus: “The śramaṇa Gautama, a son of the Śākyans, one who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, was awakened to complete and supreme awakening. The great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama are known in all directions. Thus, the Blessed One Gautama is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. Having in this life, by his own supernormal knowledge, actualized  and accomplished awakening, he announced to the world with its gods, Māra, Brahmā, people such as śramaṇas and brahmins, and beings such as gods and humans: ‘My defilements have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ It appears even in the mantras: ‘There are no other ways for a great man possessing those thirty-two marks of a great man besides these two ways: If he lives at home, he becomes a wheel-turning king who conquers the border regions in the four directions, is a righteous Dharma king, and attains the seven treasures. His seven treasures are as follows: the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He has a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. He conquers the land entirely, as far as the seashore, without risking harm, without violence, without punishment or weapons, but in accordance with the Dharma and impartially. If, however, he goes forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, he will achieve renown in the world as a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one.’ He, the śramaṇa Gautama, having traveled through the country of Kosala, has arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and is staying in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.”</p>
<p>When he heard that, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri said to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Ambāṣṭha, did you know? I have heard thus: ‘The śramaṇa Gautama, a son of the Śākyans, one who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes . . . announced: “. . . . The pure life has been lived.” I discovered it in the mantras:  “There are no other ways for a great man possessing those thirty-two marks of a great man besides these two ways: If he lives at home, he becomes a wheel-turning king who conquers the border regions in the four directions, is a righteous Dharma king . . . he will achieve renown in the world . . . .” This very man, having traveled through the country of Kosala, has arrived in Icchānaṅgalā and is staying in the Icchānaṅgalā Forest near Icchānaṅgalā.’ Now, young brahmin, go to the honorable Gautama and confirm for yourself whether the great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama, which are known in all directions, are true or not, and whether his famous marks are real or not.”</p>
<p>The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha accepted the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri’s order. With many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, he left Utkaṭā and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he sat down to one side. Then the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, face to face with the Blessed One, made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā. While the Blessed One was giving a talk consistent with the Dharma to the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha walked around in his shoes. Haughty  and arrogant, he suddenly started to speak—he did not wait until the Blessed One had finished speaking, and was thinking of talking back.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Young brahmin, do you speak suddenly and in such a way with brahmins who are familiar with the three Vedas?”</p>
<p>“How do you mean, śramaṇa Gautama?”</p>
<p>“While the Tathāgata was giving a talk consistent with the Dharma to the many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, you were walking around in your shoes. Haughty and arrogant, you suddenly started to speak, did not wait until I had finished speaking, and were thinking of talking back.”</p>
<p>“Śramaṇa Gautama, walking brahmins rightly speak with walking brahmins, standing ones with standing ones, sitting ones with sitting ones, reclining ones with reclining ones. As for shaven-headed śramaṇas, friends of darkness, and the unmarried, it is appropriate that I speak suddenly in this way, as I do now with the honorable Gautama.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, if you have come here seeking something, you, behaving in such a way, are no one but a person who has not properly served. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha seems not to have properly served teachers.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One having rebuked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words “has not properly served,” Ambāṣṭha was then enraged, angry, furious, and displeased. He wanted to talk back to the Blessed One, insult him, and quarrel with him. Thinking, “This will be enough to talk back to the śramaṇa Gautama, insult him, quarrel with him, and teach him a lesson,” he said to the Blessed One, “Hey, Gautama, these Śākyans are menials indeed. Since they come from a family of menials, they do not respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, what harm did the Śākyans do to you?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, once before,  I went on foot to the city of Kapilavastu on my own business and that of my teacher. There the Śākyan men and women, who were on the terrace, pointed at me. Saying, ‘Oh! It is the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri. It is the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, disciple of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri,’ they pointed at me without respecting, esteeming, or venerating me.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, even swallows, which are little birds, twitter however they like when they are in their own nests, let alone the Śākyans. Young brahmin, that Kapilavastu is the city of the Śākyans.”</p>
<p>“Gautama, the castes are these four: brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, and śūdra. Gautama, these four castes respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins. But these Śākyans are menials indeed. Since they come from a family of menials, they do not respect, esteem, and venerate brahmins.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One thought, “Ah, this young brahmin Ambāṣṭha excessively criticizes the Śākyans with the word menials, saying, ‘Oh! The Śākyans are menials. Oh! The Śākyans are menials.’ Now I will examine the origin of his family.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then did examine the origin of the family of the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha. He knew that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha was a descendant of a female slave of the Śākyans and that the Śākyans were sons of his masters. The Blessed One then asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Ambāṣṭha, what is your family?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, it is Kāṇvāyana.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, here I examined the origin of your family and  found that you were the son of a female slave of the Śākyans.”</p>
<p>Then the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā said to the Blessed One, “Hey, Gautama, you should not criticize the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words ‘son of a slave woman.’ Why? The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha is learned and speaks clearly and fluently. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer the honorable Gautama about this matter, according to the doctrine.”</p>
<p>“Brahmins, if you think that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer me according to the doctrine, you should be silent and let the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha answer me about this matter, according to the doctrine. If you do not think that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer me about this matter according to the doctrine, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha should be silent, and you should answer me about this matter, according to the doctrine.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha himself is learned and speaks clearly and fluently. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha can answer the honorable Gautama about this matter, according to the doctrine, and others cannot.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then recounted to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Young brahmin, once there was a king named Ikṣuvāku. King Ikṣuvāku had four sons: Ulkāmukha, Karakarṇī, Hastiniyaṃsa, and Nūpuraka. That King Ikṣuvāku banished them for a certain sin. Each taking a sister along with him, they went to other countries, other lands. In due course they arrived beside the Himalaya, on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī River. Each of them built his hut near the ṛṣi Kapila’s hermitage and married his half sister by a different mother. They had sons and daughters. Later, King Ikṣuvāku remembered these four sons and asked his ministers, ‘Where are my four sons now?’</p>
<p>“The ministers answered, ‘Your Majesty’s four sons were banished by Your Majesty for a certain sin. They are now in another country, beside the Himalaya, on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī River, and have sons and daughters.’</p>
<p>“King Ikṣuvāku then asked the ministers, ‘Hey, leaders,  are my sons able to do that?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, they are, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“Then King Ikṣuvāku stretched his upper body, raised his right hand, and spoke an inspired utterance: ‘Ah, my sons are able.’</p>
<p>“They were renowned as beings with great power. Since the king uttered the words, ‘My sons are able (śākya),’ they were named Śākya. Young brahmin, have you heard that the Śākyans were born from them, their origin is them, and their ancestors are them?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, I have heard that the Śākyans were born from them, their origin is them, and their ancestors are them.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, there was a female slave of King Ikṣuvāku named Diśikā, who was beautiful, pleasant to behold, and attractive. She lived with a ṛṣi from a mātaṅga family. Since the two lived together, a son was born. As soon as he was born, the son spoke these words: ‘Mother, please wipe me, wash me, and free me from dirty things immediately.’</p>
<p>“At that time people called fiends kāṇvāyanas. When, as soon as he was born, the son spoke the words ‘Mother, please wipe me, wash me, and free me from dirty things immediately,’ his mother exclaimed, ‘Ah, a kāṇvāyana is born!’ Thus, he was named Kāṇvāyana. Young brahmin, have you heard that the Kāṇvāyanas were born from him, their origin is him, and their ancestor is him?”</p>
<p>Being thus asked, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha remained silent. The Blessed One asked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha a second and a third time, “Young brahmin, have you heard that the Kāṇvāyanas were born from him, their origin is him, and their ancestor is him?”</p>
<p>The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha remained silent a second and a third time.</p>
<p>Then the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi raised  a vajra, which was blazing, fully blazing, thoroughly blazing, and blazing like a single tongue of flame, above the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha’s head, thinking, “If the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, having heard the Blessed One ask him three times, does not answer, I will smash his head into seven pieces with this vajra, which is blazing, fully blazing, thoroughly blazing, blazing like a single tongue of flame.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One saw the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, and the brahmin Ambāṣṭha, by the Buddha’s power, also saw him. Then the brahmin Ambāṣṭha was frightened, terrified, dejected, and, with the hair in all the pores of his body standing on end, admitted to the Blessed One, “Gautama, I have heard that the Kāṇvāyanas were born from him, their origin is him, and their ancestor is him.”</p>
<p>Then the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā thought, “The Honored One Gautama said that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha was the son of a female slave of the Śākyans and the Śākyans were sons of Ambāṣṭha’s masters. If this is true, we will no longer doubt what the honorable Gautama says.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to the elder brahmins from Utkaṭā, “You should not excessively criticize the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha with the words ‘son of a slave woman.’ Why? He was at that time a ṛṣi of great magical power and dignity. He punished King Ikṣuvāku for a certain sin. When he was punished with the punishment for a brahmin, King Ikṣuvāku was frightened, terrified, dejected, and, with the hair in all the pores of his body standing on end, held with his left hand his eldest daughter adorned with every ornament and with his right hand a golden pitcher. Although he offered her as wife to the ṛṣi, the ṛṣi did not accept her.”</p>
<p>Then, because the Blessed One  had said to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha that he was the son of a female slave, the young brahmin was upset, his shoulders drooping and his head hanging, ashamed, and in despair, and he remained silent.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One thought, “Since I said that he was the son of a female slave, this young brahmin Ambāṣṭha is upset, his shoulders drooping and his head hanging, ashamed, and in despair, and he is silent. Now I will make conversation with him.” He then said to the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha, “Young brahmin, if, for instance, the son of a kṣatriya and the daughter of a brahmin live together, and, having lived together, a son is born, is the son given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching by brahmins?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, he is.”</p>
<p>“Do kṣatriyas anoint him as a kṣatriya?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, they do. Why? Because he is a son of their brother, kṣatriyas anoint their nephew.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, if, for instance, the son of a brahmin and the daughter of a kṣatriya live together, and, having lived together, a son is born, is the son given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching by brahmins?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, he is.”</p>
<p>“Do kṣatriyas anoint him as a kṣatriya?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, they do. Why? Because he is their nephew, kṣatriyas anoint their nephew.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, if, for instance, the son of a kṣatriya is banished by kṣatriyas for a certain sin, is he given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching by brahmins?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, he is.”</p>
<p>“Do kṣatriyas anoint him as a kṣatriya?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, they do. Why? Because he is their kinsman, kṣatriyas anoint their kinsman.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, if, for instance, the son of a brahmin is banished by brahmins for a certain sin, is he given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching by brahmins?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, he is not.”</p>
<p>“Do kṣatriyas anoint him as a kṣatriya?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, they do not. Why? Because he is a brahmin caṇḍāla, kṣatriyas do not anoint a brahmin caṇḍāla.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, therefore, the family of kṣatriyas is the best in birth, family, and race, not the family of brahmins. Young brahmin, Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Among people relying on race,</p>
<p>Kṣatriyas are the most noble.</p>
<p>Among gods and humans,</p>
<p>The one perfect in knowledge and conduct is the most noble.’</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, the verse spoken by Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, which says:</p>
<p>“ ‘Among people relying on race,</p>
<p>Kṣatriyas are the most noble.</p>
<p>Among gods and humans,</p>
<p>The one perfect in knowledge and conduct is the most noble,’</p>
<p>“is not a faulty saying but a good saying; it’s not a faulty statement but a good statement. Why? I also say:</p>
<p>“Among people relying on race,</p>
<p>Kṣatriyas are the most noble.</p>
<p>Among gods and humans,</p>
<p>The one perfect in knowledge and conduct is the noble.</p>
<p>“What do you think, young brahmin? When there is a wedding, when a bride is given and received in some place, are brahmins given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching there?”</p>
<p>“Gautama, when there is a wedding, when a bride is given and received in some place, brahmins are given a seat, water, mantra, or teaching there.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, when there is a wedding, when a bride is given and received in some place,  there is the arrogance of family, the arrogance of birth, and the arrogance of a brahmin’s son.</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, as long as beings are tied down by the arrogance of family, the arrogance of birth, and the arrogance of a brahmin’s son, they do not actualize this supreme state of one perfect in knowledge and conduct, and they have no opportunity to do so. Young brahmin, if they abandon the arrogance of family, the arrogance of birth, and the arrogance of a brahmin’s son, those who have not actualized this supreme state of one perfect in knowledge and conduct will actualize it.”</p>
<p>“I, as one who has not existed in the past, will not exist in the future, and does not exist in the present, believe in the honorable Gautama. May the honorable Gautama teach the Dharma so that I will desire to attain knowledge and conduct.”</p>
<p>“Then, young brahmin, listen to it well and keep it in mind; I shall teach it.</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, here in the world there has appeared a teacher who is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. He teaches Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good at the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in wording, distinct, complete, pure, and immaculate, teaching the pure life. Householders or sons of householders listen to the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, each of them gains faith. Each of them, with his faith gained, trains himself, thinking, ‘Life at home is confining and full of dust. Going forth is like a wide open space. It is difficult for laymen who live at home to lead a pure life that is totally pure, complete, completely pure, and immaculate throughout their lives.  Now I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.’</p>
<p>“Having thus gone forth, he abides by moral conduct. He is controlled by the restraint of the prātimokṣa, perfect in his deeds and personal associations, and afraid of even a minuscule fault. Having accepted the rules of training, he trains himself.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned killing, he abstains from killing. He abandons punishments and weapons. He is conscientious and merciful. He abstains from killing any living creatures, even those as small as ants.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned theft, he abstains from theft. He takes and is pleased with the things given to him, and he is pleased with giving abundantly. He is neither a thief nor covetous, but pure. Keeping watch over himself, he abstains from theft.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned sexual intercourse, he abstains from sexual intercourse. He leads the pure life and is immaculate because he has abandoned evil conduct. He is pure, without foul odor, free from copulation; he is free from vulgarity, and he abstains from sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned lying, he abstains from lying. He speaks and is pleased with the truth. He is trustworthy, reliable, and steadfast; he does not deceive people in the world and abstains from lying.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned slander, he abstains from slander. He does not repeat what he has heard from this side to that side and vice versa for the purpose of splitting others apart, but he reconciles those who are at odds and encourages those who are in harmony.  He is pleased with harmony and delighted with harmony. He speaks words that make people harmonious and abstains from slander.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned harsh language, he abstains from harsh language. He has abandoned words that are vicious, rough, and aggressive toward others, that threaten others, and that are undesirable for many people, displeasing for many people, disagreeable and unpleasant for many people, inharmonious, and useless to harmony. He speaks words that are harmless, pleasant to the ear, heartwarming, pleasing, refined, sweet sounding, clear, convincing, trustworthy, independent, not obstinate, and not servile, but desirable, pleasing, agreeable, and pleasant for many people, harmonious, and conducive to harmony. Having abandoned harsh language, he abstains from harsh language.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned senseless talk, he abstains from senseless talk. He speaks at appropriate times, speaks correctly, tells the truth, relates what is meaningful and right, relates what he has realized, and relates what is comprehensible. He speaks at appropriate times what is not confused, but has a foundation and proof, and is right and meaningful. Having abandoned senseless talk, he abstains from senseless talk.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned trade, he abstains from trade.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned the falsification of measures, weights, and size, he abstains from the falsification of measures, weights, and size.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned bribery, deceit, and extortion, he abstains from bribery, deceit, and extortion.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned thoughts of slaying, binding, cutting, piercing, and striking, he abstains from making others suffer from slaying, binding, cutting, piercing, and striking.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned lying down when it is light or lying down in a lodging where there is a woman, he abstains from lying down when it is light or lying down in a lodging where there is a woman.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting things from fields, houses, and markets, he abstains from accepting things from fields, houses, and markets.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting elephants, horses, cows, sheep, chickens, and pigs, he abstains from accepting elephants, horses, cows, sheep, chickens, and pigs.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting male slaves, female slaves, and laborers, he abstains from accepting male slaves, female slaves, and laborers.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting women, men, boys, and girls, he abstains from accepting women, men, boys, and girls.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting gold and silver, he abstains from accepting gold and silver.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned accepting raw grains, he abstains from accepting raw grains.</p>
<p>“He eats only one meal a day. He has abandoned having meals at inappropriate times. He goes for alms at the appropriate time. He makes efforts to go for alms at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>“He is content and satisfied with the proper clothes on his body and is content and satisfied with eating alms that are just sufficient. Being content and satisfied with clothes and food in such a way,  he carries his bowl and his robes wherever he goes. Just as a feathered bird, wherever it goes, soars with its feathers and wings, he carries his bowl and his robes wherever he goes, content and satisfied with clothes and food in such a way.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, some śramaṇas and brahmins, having enjoyed what was given with faith, live devoted to efforts aimed at injuring various seeds and plants, namely, those that grow from roots, stems, the tops of joints, grafts, and the seeds themselves. He abstains from the way that some śramaṇas and brahmins live devoted to efforts aimed at injuring various seeds and plants.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, some śramaṇas and brahmins, having enjoyed what was given with faith, live devoted to efforts aimed at hoarding various things, namely, hoarding food, drink, incense, garlands, leaves, flowers, and fruits. He abstains from the way that some śramaṇas and brahmins live devoted to efforts aimed at hoarding various things.</p>

<p>“Because he has that noble aggregate of moral conduct, he experiences inner, faultless happiness. With the doors of his faculties restrained, his mindfulness well guarded, exerting himself mindfully, he behaves with equanimity with a mind guarded by mindfulness. When he sees forms with his eyes, he does not grasp them with their characteristics and secondary marks. Why? When he abides with his eye faculty unrestrained,  because his longing and despair toward the world arise, evil and unwholesome elements follow his mind. In order to restrain them, he practices, protects himself, and restrains his eye faculty with his eye faculty. Likewise, when he cognizes sounds with his ears, smells with his nose, tastes with his tongue, tangible objects with his body, and mental objects with his mind, he does not grasp them with their characteristics and secondary marks. Why? When he abides with his mental faculty unrestrained, because his longing and despair toward the world arise, evil and unwholesome elements follow his mind. In order to restrain them, he practices, protects himself, and restrains his mental faculty with his mental faculty.</p>
<p>“Because he has that noble aggregate of moral conduct, and the doors of his faculties are restrained, he experiences inner, faultless happiness and abides with vigilance in going back and forth. He also abides with vigilance while watching, observing, bending and stretching his body, holding his outer robe, robe, and bowl, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, not sleeping, talking, not talking, sleeping, being tired, and resting.</p>
<p>“Because he has that noble aggregate of moral conduct, the doors of his faculties are restrained, and he is mindful and supremely vigilant, he experiences inner, faultless happiness and abides in solitary dwelling places: wilderness, under trees, and in empty houses. He sits in any of these places. Sitting with his legs crossed, he straightens his back and focuses his mind on a point in front of him. He has abandoned longing for the world. With a mind free from longing, he stays in this manner many times, and his mind is completely cleansed of longing.  He has abandoned malice and despair, depression, tiredness, restlessness, regret, and doubt toward the world. He has overcome hesitancy and doubt and achieved certainty about virtuous things. His mind is completely cleansed of doubt.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, as an example, a man, having gotten into debt, exerts himself for his business. When he succeeds in the business, he pays off the debt out of the profits and still has enough wealth to feed his wife. He thinks, ‘Having gotten into debt, I exerted myself for my business. When I succeeded in the business, I paid off the debt out of the profits and still have enough wealth to feed my wife.’ He becomes happy and satisfied for that reason.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, as another example, there is a man who is sick, seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness. He is not able to digest the food he has eaten. The drink he has drunk hurts his stomach. But later he becomes free from illness, stronger, and comfortable; he is able to digest the food he has eaten, and the drink he has drunk does not hurt his stomach. He thinks, ‘I was once sick, seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness; then I was not able to digest the food I had eaten, and the drink I had drunk hurt my stomach. But now I am free from illness, stronger, and comfortable; I am able to digest the food I eat, and the drink I drink does not hurt my stomach.’ He becomes happy and satisfied for that reason.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, as another example, a man becomes a slave, servant, retainer, or bondman and becomes dependent. But later he is released from being a slave, servant, retainer, or bondman. He thinks,  ‘I was once a slave, servant, retainer, or bondman and was dependent. But now I am not a slave, servant, retainer, or bondman, and I am independent.’ He becomes happy and satisfied for that reason.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, as another example, a man is confined in prison and has his hands tied tightly behind his back. But later he is liberated from being confined in prison and having his hands tied tightly behind his back—safely, successfully, and without paying money. He thinks, ‘I was once confined in prison and had my hands tied tightly behind my back. But now I have been liberated from that situation safely, successfully, and without paying money.’ He becomes happy and satisfied for that reason.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, as another example, a man who had been in fear becomes safe, and he who had had a very poor harvest gains abundant food. He thinks, ‘Thus I, who was once in fear, became safe, and I, who had a very poor harvest, gained abundant food.’ He becomes happy and satisfied for that reason.</p>
<p>“In this manner, having abandoned the five obstacles, which are like that debt, illness, servitude, prison, and fear, he observes correctly.</p>
<p>“Having abandoned the five obstacles, which cause lesser defilements of the mind, reduce intelligence, are associated with harm, and are not associated with nirvāṇa, he is free from desires, free from evil and unwholesome elements, and he dwells having achieved the first dhyāna, which is endowed with thought, investigation, pleasure, and happiness produced from solitude.</p>
<p>“As an analogy, if a bath attendant or a skillful pupil of a bath attendant moistens fine soap powder with water in a bronze bowl, a wooden tub, or a shell, the lump of soap becomes wet, grows thick with moisture,  and does not drop or fall because its inside and outside are fully moisturized. So too, the body of the monk is completely immersed, perfectly immersed, perfectly satisfied, and perfectly filled with pleasure and happiness produced from solitude, and in his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with pleasure and happiness produced from solitude.</p>
<p>“Then he becomes free from thought and investigation, with complete inner purity. Because his mental continuum is concentrated on one point, he dwells having achieved the second dhyāna, which is without thought or investigation and endowed with pleasure and happiness produced from meditation. Thus, his body is completely immersed, perfectly immersed, perfectly satisfied, and perfectly filled with pleasure and happiness produced from meditation, and in his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with pleasure and happiness produced from meditation.</p>
<p>“It is just as, for instance, on the summit of a mountain there may be a spring-fed lake. Water does not flow into the lake from the east, or from the south, the west, or the north, and the gods do not bring rain there. However, from that lake itself a fountain or a large spring issues forth and the entire lake is filled, completely filled, fully filled, and completely penetrated with cool water. There is no part of that entire lake that is not filled or has not been filled with cool water. So too, his body is completely immersed, perfectly immersed, perfectly satisfied, and perfectly filled with pleasure and happiness produced from meditation, and in his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with  pleasure and happiness produced from meditation.</p>
<p>“Then he becomes free from the desire for pleasure. Thus, abiding in equanimity, he possesses mindfulness and vigilance. He experiences happiness with his body, and, as explained by the noble ones, he possesses mindfulness, abides in happiness, and is equanimous. He dwells having achieved the third dhyāna, in which pleasure is absent. Thus, his body is completely immersed, perfectly immersed, perfectly satisfied, and perfectly filled with happiness free from pleasure, and in his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with happiness free from pleasure.</p>
<p>“And just as, for instance, utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers sprout and grow in water, they are bound between their roots and tips, and there is no part that is not soaked or has not been soaked with cool water, so, too, his body is completely immersed, perfectly immersed, perfectly satisfied, and perfectly filled with happiness free from pleasure, and in his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with happiness free from pleasure.</p>
<p>“Then he abandons happiness, too. Since he has already abandoned pain, and his longing and despair have also disappeared, he dwells having achieved the fourth dhyāna, which is neither happy nor painful, but completely clear, with equanimity and mindfulness. Thus, delighted, he dwells with his body filled with a clear and pure mind, complete.</p>
<p>“As an analogy, if a householder or a son of a householder covers his head, hands, and feet with eight or nine cubits of cloth, there is, on his  whole body from head to toe, no part that is not covered or has not been covered with pure, clean cloth. So, too, he dwells delighted, with his body filled with a clear and pure mind, complete. In his body there is no part that is not filled or has not been filled with a clear and pure mind, complete.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, when a noble disciple has abandoned happiness and, since he has already abandoned pain, and his longing and despair have disappeared, he dwells having achieved the fourth dhyāna, which is neither happy nor painful, but completely clear with equanimity and mindfulness, his mind is neither weak nor faint. Because he dwells with neither weakness nor faintness, he is able to dwell steadfastly.</p>
<p>“It is just as, for instance, when a seed oil lamp is lit on the top of a house or on a terrace on the top of a house, being not agitated or shaken by the wind, or by a bird, or by a person, or by a nonhuman, its flame grows neither weak nor faint. Since it is neither weak nor faint, it blazes steadfastly. So too, Ambāṣṭha, when a noble disciple has abandoned happiness, and, since he has already abandoned pain, and his longing and despair have also disappeared, he dwells having achieved the fourth dhyāna, which is neither happy nor painful, but completely clear with equanimity and mindfulness, his mind is neither weak nor faint. Because he dwells without either weakness or faintness, he is able to dwell without agitation, and he thinks thus: ‘This form of my body is coarse, generated from the cause of the four great elements. My consciousness adheres to this, dwells in this, and pervades this. Now I will move my consciousness from this body  and create another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.’ He then does move his consciousness from the body and creates another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, it is just as, for instance, a jewel, an excellent lapis lazuli that is of fair origin and is clear, pure, and stainless, is threaded with a string of five colors, namely, blue, yellow, red, white, and madder. If a man of keen eyes sees this, he knows thus: ‘This is a string, this is a jewel, and this is a jewel threaded with a string.’ So, too, he moves his consciousness from the body and creates another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, it is just as, for instance, a man extracts a reed from munja grass. If a man of keen eyes sees this, he knows thus: ‘This is munja grass, this is a reed, and the reed has been extracted from the munja grass.’ So, too, he moves his consciousness from the body and creates another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, it is just as, for instance, a man pulls a snake out of a basket. If a man of keen eyes sees this, he knows thus: ‘This is a basket, this is a snake, and the snake has been pulled out of the basket.’ So, too, he moves his consciousness from the body and creates another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.</p>
<p>“Ambāṣṭha, it is just as, for instance, a man takes a sword from its sheath. If a man of keen eyes sees this, he knows thus: ‘This is a sheath, this is a sword, and the sword has been taken from its sheath.’ So, too, he moves his consciousness from the body and creates another body with a form generated from consciousness, and with faculties that are neither wanting nor inferior.</p>
<p>“Thus, with his mind adjusted, clean, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, he inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the domains of magical powers. He enjoys many kinds of domains of magical powers: namely, he becomes many after being one; he becomes one after being many; he experiences the perfect knowledge of being visible and invisible; and he can even pass through a wall, a mountain, or a fence. With his body he moves without obstacles as if in the sky; he moves on the surface of the ground and dives into it as if into water; he moves in water against the current as if on the ground; he moves through the sky with his legs crossed as if he were a flying bird. He seizes and touches the sun and the moon, which themselves have great magical power and great might. With his body he controls the world including the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“It is just as, for instance, a goldsmith or a skillful pupil of a goldsmith, knowing that the gold is well prepared, quickly hammers out various things that he wants to make, namely, bowls, necklaces, bracelets, anklets, signet rings, and golden garlands. So too, he, with his mind adjusted, clean, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the domains of magical powers: namely,  he becomes many after being one; . . . . With his body he controls the world including the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“Just as for instance, a potter or a skillful pupil of a potter, knowing that a lump of clay is well prepared, quickly makes various kinds of containers that he wants to make, so too, he, with his mind adjusted, clean, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the domains of magical powers: namely, he becomes many after being one; . . . . With his body he controls the world including the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“Just as for instance, an ivory carver or a skillful pupil of an ivory carver, knowing that the ivory is well prepared, quickly makes various kinds of objects that he wants to make, so too, he, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the domains of magical powers: namely, he becomes many after being one; . . . . With his body he controls the world including the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“And thus he, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, also inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of divine hearing. With his pure divine hearing, which is superior to that of humans, he hears the voices of humans and nonhumans, whether distant or close.</p>
<p>“As an analogy, if a conch blower climbs a high mountain and blows a conch at midnight, the sound will fill every direction in the land without any obstacles. So too, he, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved,  inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of divine hearing. With his pure divine hearing, which is superior to that of humans, he hears the voices of humans and nonhumans, whether distant or close.</p>
<p>“And thus he, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, also inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of various states of mind. He knows with his mind the minds, which consist of thought and investigation, of other beings and other people exactly as they are: he correctly recognizes a mind possessed of desire exactly as it is; he correctly recognizes a mind free from desire exactly as it is; and he correctly recognizes minds possessed of anger, free from anger, possessed of delusion, free from delusion, concentrated, distracted, discouraged, uplifted, small, large, restless, not restless, pacified, unpacified, settled, unsettled, developed, undeveloped, liberated, and unliberated exactly as they are.</p>
<p>“Just as, for instance, a man of keen eyes completely cleanses the disk of a mirror and observes the characteristics of his face, he,  with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of various states of mind . . . . He correctly recognizes a well-liberated mind exactly as it is.</p>
<p>“Thus, ‘conduct’ is explained.</p>
<p>“What is ‘knowledge’? With his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, he inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects many past lives, namely, one life; two lives; three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, and a hundred thousand lives; hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of lives; an eon of destruction; an eon of creation; an eon of destruction and creation; many eons of destruction; many eons of creation; and many eons of destruction and creation. ‘When I was born among these beings, my name was such-and-such, my birth was such-and-such, my family was such-and-such, I ate such-and-such foods, and I experienced such-and-such happiness and pain. My life was this long, my age was this great, and I attained such longevity. Then I died and was born as such-and-such. I died there  and was reborn as such-and-such. I again died there and was born here.’ Thus he recollects various past lives along with their characteristics, regions, and origins from which he was born.</p>
<p>“It is just as, for instance, a man goes from one village to another village, and then he goes to another village and thinks thus: ‘I went from the village such-and-such to the village such-and-such. Then I went to the village such-and-such. From that village, I came to this village.’ So too, he, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects many past lives: namely, one life . . . . He recollects various past lives along with their characteristics and regions.</p>
<p>“He, with his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of death and rebirth. With his pure divine sight, which is superior to that of humans, he sees the death and rebirth of beings, noble and ignoble races, inferior and superior people, and pleasurable and inferior modes of existence. He knows that beings go to their next births according to their actions exactly as they performed them. ‘These beings performed evil acts of the body  and evil acts of speech and mind, they falsely accused noble ones, and they accepted false doctrines and behaviors connected with the teachings of false doctrines. From these causes and conditions, they will be born in hells, which are inferior modes of existence, inferior states of existence, and a great fall, after the destruction of the body. These beings performed virtuous acts of the body and virtuous acts of speech and mind, and they did not falsely accuse noble ones, but they accepted right doctrines and behaviors connected with the teachings of right doctrines. From these causes and conditions, they will be born among the gods in the heavens, which are pleasurable modes of existence, after the destruction of the body.’</p>
<p>“Just as, for instance, a man of keen eyes, sitting in the middle of a crossroad of main streets, observes many people come, sit, recline, and go to other places, so too, he, with his pure divine sight, which is superior to that of humans . . . : ‘. . . they will be born among the gods.’</p>
<p>“With his mind adjusted, clear, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, he also inclines his mind toward the supernormal knowledge with which he actualizes the knowledge of the exhaustion of impurities. He correctly knows thus: ‘This is suffering, which is a truth of the noble ones,’ exactly as it is. He correctly knows thus: ‘This is the origination of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering, which are the truths of the noble ones,’ exactly as they are. When he has thus known and seen, his mind is liberated from the impurities of desire, and his mind is liberated from the impurities of existence and ignorance. Having been liberated, he sees thus with the very knowledge of liberation: ‘My births have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence.’</p>
<p>“It is just as, for instance, near a village or town there may be a deep lake in which the water is clear, pure, completely pure. There a man of keen eyes, sitting on the bank, may observe pebbles, gravel, fish, turtles, pearl oysters, or bivalve shells. So too, he, with his mind adjusted, clean, pure, free from the primary defilements, free from lesser defilements, straightened, active, and unmoved, . . .  ‘ . . . I will not know another existence.’</p>
<p>“Thus, ‘knowledge’ is explained. This and the aforementioned conduct are combined and called knowledge and conduct.</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, you should know the four wrong means for actualizing the unactualized supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct. What are the four?</p>
<p>“Here some śramaṇas or brahmins, not actualizing this supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct, go from a village to the wilderness and live there, having built huts of branches and leaves. Saying, ‘Let us make our living from roots and fruits here,’ they do make their living from roots and fruits there. Young brahmin, this is the first wrong means for actualizing the unactualized supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct. What do you think, young brahmin? Do you find yourself with your teacher in the first wrong means that I have explained for actualizing the supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct not yet actualized?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, I do not.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, again, some śramaṇas or brahmins, not actualizing this supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct, abandon the food of roots and fruits, go to a solitary place, and live there, having built huts of branches and leaves. Saying, ‘Let us  make our living from the food of leaves here,’ they do make their living from the food of leaves there. Young brahmin, this is the second wrong means for actualizing the unactualized supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct.</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, again, some śramaṇas or brahmins, not actualizing this supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct, abandon the food of roots and fruits and the food of leaves, go to a solitary place, and live there, having built huts of branches and leaves. Saying, ‘Let us write mantras and compose Vedas here,’ they do write mantras and compose Vedas there. Young brahmin, this is the third wrong means for actualizing the unactualized supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct.</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, again, some śramaṇas or brahmins, not actualizing this supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct, not actualizing the food of roots and fruits, the food of leaves, or writing mantras and composing Vedas, go from the wilderness to the edge of a village and live there, having built houses with four doorways. They think, ‘Let us give donations and make merit here. Let us offer as much almsfood as possible to śramaṇas or brahmins who come.’ Young brahmin, this is the fourth wrong means for actualizing the unactualized supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct.</p>
<p>“What do you think, young brahmin? Do you find yourself with your teacher in the four wrong means that I have explained for actualizing the supreme perfection of knowledge and conduct not yet actualized?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, I do not.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, while you had thus not completed even these four wrong means, why did you say such words indicating the Śākyans were menials: ‘Oh! The Śākyans  are menials. Oh! The Śākyans are menials.’ What do you think, young brahmin? The old mantras of brahmin ṛṣis, who were the ancestors of brahmins and made mantras and created the Vedas, have been praised, sung, and chanted. Still today brahmins sing and explain them. Those brahmin ṛṣis are Aṣṭaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Aṅgiras, Bharadvāja, Vasiṣṭha, Kāśyapa, and Bhṛgu. Did they build cities surrounded with moats and thorns, like you and your teacher do today?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, they did not.”</p>
<p>“Did they enjoy various spectacles such as sham fights, a display of banners, an army, and the deployment of an army, like you and your teacher do today?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, they did not.”</p>
<p>“Did they go back and forth in the country, riding entirely white chariots pulled by mares, carrying a golden water jar with a handle, and surrounded and followed by young brahmins, like you and your teacher do today?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, they did not.”</p>
<p>“Did they have their bodies rubbed, washed, and scrubbed by female servants in headdresses, whose upper arms were covered with fine baby hairs like those of young gourds and whose breasts were round like balls, like you and your teacher do today?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, they did not.”</p>
<p>“Did they sleep with their legs stretched out, along with women well decorated in golden bracelets and golden necklaces, until the sun rose,  like you and your teacher do today?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, they did not.”</p>
<p>“Look, young brahmin, your teacher has faults, too. Young brahmin, when the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri went to see King Prasenajit of Kosala, he was not able to see the king without a wall and curtain as screens between them. Why was such a learned man not able to see face to face the person who provided him with food?</p>
<p>“Look, young brahmin, you yourself have faults, too. Young brahmin, once King Prasenajit of Kosala, sitting on his own throne, said to someone, ‘My man, do such-and-such business. When you have done that, investigate such-and-such things.’ Having given these instructions, the king rose from his seat and departed. Then the man sat on the king’s seat during his absence and said to someone else, ‘My man, do such-and-such business. When you have done that, investigate such-and-such things.’ What do you think, young brahmin? Is he a king or suitable as a king, the man who sat on the king’s seat during his absence and said what the king had said?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, he is not.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, you repeat and recite the words of ṛṣis. Then, are you a ṛṣi or suitable as a ṛṣi?”</p>
<p>“No, Gautama, I am not.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, yet inscribe well in your mind the aim with which you came here, and it will be your everlasting prosperity, benefit, and happiness.”</p>
<p>The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha then examined the thirty-two marks of a great man on the Blessed One’s body. Though he saw thirty of them, he had doubt and uncertainty about two: the private part hidden in a sheath and the exceedingly long and narrow tongue. He then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“I have heard of</p>
<p>The great Muni’s thirty-two marks.</p>
<p>Of them, Gautama,</p>
<p>I have not seen two on your body.</p>
<p>“O best of men, is your private part</p>
<p>Hidden in a sheath?</p>
<p>Is your tongue, which is praised as excellent,</p>
<p>Really long?</p>
<p>“Since it is difficult in this world to see</p>
<p>The famed perfectly awakened ones,</p>
<p>Please dart your narrow tongue out of your mouth</p>
<p>And clear up my doubts.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One thought thus: “When this young brahmin Ambāṣṭha examined the thirty-two marks of a great man on my body, he saw thirty of them, but he has doubt and uncertainty about two: the private part hidden in a sheath and the exceedingly long and narrow tongue. Now I will manifest a sign so that the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha will see my private part hidden in a sheath and my exceedingly long and narrow tongue.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then manifested that sign. The young brahmin Ambāṣṭha saw the Blessed One’s private part hidden in a sheath and saw his exceedingly long and narrow tongue darting out of his mouth and covering his whole face up to his hairline. When he had seen these, he thought thus: “The śramaṇa Gautama possesses the thirty-two marks of a great man. There are no other alternatives for a great man who possesses these marks besides these two alternatives: if he lives at home as a layman . . . . He will achieve renown in the world.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One and departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>At that time, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri was sitting together with many elder brahmins from Utkaṭā on the upper floor of his best house. As he was sitting and waiting for the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha,  the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha saw him from a distance. Upon seeing him, Ambāṣṭha went to the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri, and then he also bowed to the other brahmins from Utkaṭā and sat down to one side. When the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha had sat down, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri asked him, “Young brahmin, are the great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama, which are known in all directions, true? Are his famous marks real?”</p>
<p>“True, sir. The great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that honorable Gautama, which are known on all sides, are true. His famous marks are real.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, did you have a conversation with the honorable Gautama?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I did.”</p>
<p>“Young brahmin, then tell me everything in detail.”</p>
<p>Then the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha told the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri everything about the conversation he had had with the Blessed One. When he had told him about it, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri became enraged, angry, furious, and displeased. He kicked the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha in the head with a shod foot and said, “Fie on you, messenger! Fie on you, emissary! I will fall into the inferior states of existence because of such a messenger and emissary as you. Young brahmin, the honorable Gautama will treat me as he treats you, who considered the honorable Gautama to be contemptible and talked back.  Sirs, I cannot go to see the honorable Gautama and perform respectful service for him today. However, tomorrow I will go to see the honorable Gautama and perform respectful service for him.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. He rose at dawn and went to the Blessed One, bringing a carriage full of those pure and fine foods. When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and then sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honorable Gautama, I have brought a carriage full of pure and fine foods; please have compassion for me and accept these foods.”</p>
<p>At that time the venerable Ānanda was sitting behind the Blessed One, fanning him with a fan. The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and gather all the monks living near Icchānaṅgalā in the assembly room.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda. When he had gathered all the monks living near Icchānaṅgalā in the assembly room, he went to the Blessed One. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, all the monks living near Icchānaṅgalā  are sitting together in the assembly room. May the Blessed One know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One went to the assembly room. When he arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The brahmin Pauṣkarasāri then knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal. When, with his own hands, he had served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the brahmin took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One then applauded the offering made by the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri with this celebration:</p>
<p>“Agnihotra is the best of sacrifices.</p>
<p>The best of verses is Sāvitrī.</p>
<p>The best of humans is a king.</p>
<p>The ocean is the best of water bodies.</p>
<p>The moon is chief among celestial bodies.</p>
<p>The sun is the sovereign among all lights.</p>
<p>“Above, below, all around,</p>
<p>In all the modes of existence of beings,</p>
<p>In the world including gods,</p>
<p>The best of those who speak is the perfectly awakened one.”</p>
<p>At that time, when the rewards of the offerings were being assigned to the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri, a monk who had gone forth in his old age ate a piece of sesame cake. When the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri saw the monk who had gone forth in his old age eat that sesame cake when the rewards of the offerings were being assigned, he asked the Blessed One, “Do all the disciples please the honorable Gautama’s mind?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, here it differs: some do and others do not.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, thus some eat the Dharma and another  eats sesame cake. O Gautama, did my disciple Ambāṣṭha come to you?”</p>
<p>“Yes he did, O brahmin.”</p>
<p>“Did the honorable Gautama have a conversation with him?”</p>
<p>“Yes I did, O brahmin.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, then tell me in detail all about the talk you had with him.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One told the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri all about the talk he had had with the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha. Then brahmin Pauṣkarasāri then said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha is a mere child and does not know his own place. O Gautama, please forgive the young brahmin Ambāṣṭha.”</p>
<p>“I will do so, O brahmin.”</p>
<p>“O honorable Gautama, if you see me riding a chariot, holding the reins, and cracking a whip, or walking with a loud voice, please understand that I, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri, am bowing to you and asking if you are free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. O honorable Gautama, if you see me walking in the middle of the street, taking off my shoes, stepping aside on a path, or stretching out my hands, please think that I am bowing to you . . . and comfort. O honorable Gautama, if you see me in the middle of attendants, clothed, on a seat, and with my turban on, please think that I am bowing to you . . . and comfort. Why, O honorable Gautama? Brahmins  obtain their possessions by fame. They expect to get their possessions by that very fame.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then thought, “Ah, this brahmin Pauṣkarasāri is very haughty. Now I will preach the Dharma in order to remove his haughtiness.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri. He extensively gave discourses on the Dharma of the buddhas, the blessed ones, that are to be given in advance of the main sermon: namely, a discourse on donations, a discourse on conduct, a discourse on the heavens, and a discourse on the gains and faults of desires, defilements, purification, emancipation, the merits of complete seclusion, and the things belonging to purification.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had seen that the brahmin had become pleased, virtuous in mind, delighted in mind, free from mental obstacles, suitable to be a vessel, powerful, and able to know perfectly the excellent Dharma, he preached in detail the teachings of the Dharma of the buddhas, the blessed ones: namely, suffering, the origination of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering, which are the four truths of the noble ones. Just as when a spotless, clean white cloth suitable for dyeing is placed in dye, it absorbs the dye well, the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri, seated on his seat, understood clearly the four truths of the noble ones.</p>
<p>Then the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri  saw the Dharma, attained the Dharma, knew the Dharma, plumbed the depths of the Dharma, overcame his doubts, became independent from others and not to be led by others, and achieved confidence in himself about the Dharma preached by the Teacher. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>The brahmin Pauṣkarasāri then rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from his seat, and departed.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, since the brahmin Pauṣkarasāri criticized that event, a monk should not eat when the rewards of offerings are being assigned. If he eats, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>III. Saptaparṇa</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived at Saptaparṇa. In Saptaparṇa . . . the seat of four buddhas . . . .</p>
<p>IV. Sunrise</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived in Sunrise. He stayed in Kaṇṭakasthala Forest near Sunrise.</p>
<p>When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the śramaṇa Gautama, having traveled in the country of Kosala, had arrived at Sunrise and was staying in Kaṇṭakasthala Forest near Sunrise, he ordered a man, “My man, go to the śramaṇa Gautama.  Bow low on my behalf until your forehead touches the feet of the śramaṇa Gautama and ask if he is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort. Then say, ‘O honorable Gautama, King Prasenajit of Kosala would like to come to see the Blessed One tomorrow. May the honorable Gautama know this.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to King Prasenajit of Kosala, and he went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side and said to him, “King Prasenajit of Kosala bows low until his forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet and asks if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort.”</p>
<p>“My good man, I hope you and King Prasenajit of Kosala are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“O honorable Gautama, King Prasenajit of Kosala would like to come to see the Blessed One tomorrow. May the honorable Gautama know this.”</p>
<p>“My good man, let King Prasenajit of Kosala know that today is the right time.”</p>
<p>Then the man rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One and departed from the Blessed One’s presence. Thereupon the Blessed One, as soon as the man had departed, said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and prepare many seats in the large monastery. I will sit there and have a meeting with King Prasenajit of Kosala today.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,”  replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. He did prepare many seats in the large monastery and then returned to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I have prepared many seats in the large monastery. May the Blessed One know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then went to the large monastery. When he had arrived, he sat on the prepared seat.</p>
<p>Then, as soon as the man had reported on his mission to King Prasenajit of Kosala and departed, the king said to another man, “My man, now quickly prepare a beautiful vehicle. I will ride in it and go to see the śramaṇa Gautama today.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to King Prasenajit of Kosala. After he had prepared the beautiful vehicle, he returned to the king. When he had arrived, he said to King Prasenajit of Kosala, “Your Majesty, the vehicle is ready. May Your Majesty know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>At that time, two sisters named Beautiful and Sunny came to the dining hall of King Prasenajit of Kosala. When these two sisters, Beautiful and Sunny, heard that the king was going to go to see the Blessed One that day, they said to King Prasenajit of Kosala, “Your Majesty, if you are going to go to see the Blessed One today, please bow low on our behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet, and ask if he is free from trouble, free from illness,  in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort.”</p>
<p>“I will do so,” replied King Prasenajit of Kosala. Then the king, riding the beautiful vehicle, left Sunrise and went to see and serve the Blessed One. Having gone as far as he could go by vehicle, he alighted from the vehicle and entered the park on foot. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side and said to him, ‘The two sisters, Beautiful and Sunny, ask if the Blessed One is free from trouble, free from illness, in good physical condition, healthy, without any trouble, and living in vigor and comfort.’</p>
<p>“Did the two sisters Beautiful and Sunny not find any other messenger? Why is it not someone other than you, Great King?”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, when the two sisters Beautiful and Sunny came to my dining hall, they heard that the king was going to go to see the Blessed One today. Having heard this, they said to me, ‘Your Majesty, if you are going to go to see the Blessed One today, please bow low on our behalf until your forehead touches the Blessed One’s feet . . . comfort.’ ”</p>
<p>“O Great King, I hope you and the two sisters, Beautiful and Sunny, are living in comfort, too.”</p>
<p>“Now, if you would deign to answer my questions,  I would ask you, honorable Gautama, about a few points.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, ask what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, I have heard that you have said, ‘It is impossible, out of the question, that other śramaṇas or brahmins know or see everything.’ O Gautama, do you think you have said this?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, I do not remember saying that.”</p>
<p>At that time, a general named Virūḍhaka was sitting in the assembly. King Prasenajit of Kosala said to General Virūḍhaka, “O General, do you remember who told such a story one day in the past, when the king, ministers, and the king’s attendants were sitting together in the royal palace?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty, I do. It was the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky.”</p>
<p>King Prasenajit of Kosala then said to a man, “My man, go now to the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky. When you have arrived, say to the young brahmin, ‘King Prasenajit of Kosala summons you.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to King Prasenajit of Kosala, and he went to the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky. When he had arrived, he said to the young brahmin, “King Prasenajit of Kosala summons you.”</p>
<p>Then King Prasenajit of Kosala, as soon as the man had departed, asked the Blessed One, “O Gautama, did someone here misunderstand what you meant or said?”</p>
<p>“Yes, O Great King. What I meant was something else.  He related it to others incorrectly.”</p>
<p>“Honorable Gautama, what do you think you said?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, I remember saying, ‘It is impossible, out of the question, that other śramaṇas or brahmins know or see everything.’ ’’</p>
<p>“O honorable Gautama, it is reasonable that you said this. It is reasonable that the honorable Gautama said this. Now, if you would deign to answer my questions, I would ask you, honorable Gautama, about a few points.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, ask what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, the castes are these four: brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, and śūdra. Is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, O Great King, there is. Among them, those who are from brahmin and kṣatriya families are regarded by humans as high ranking; those who are from vaiśya and śūdra families are regarded by humans as low ranking.”</p>
<p>“I am not asking you, honorable Gautama, about the matter of this life but about the matter of the afterlife. O Gautama, the castes are these four: brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, and śūdra. Is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between them?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, the castes are these four: kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, and śūdra. If they accept instruction, teaching, and preaching on the Dharma by the Tathāgata or disciples of the Tathāgata,  is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between them in the future, in their next lives?”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, the castes are these four: kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, and śūdra. If they accept instruction, teaching, and preaching on the Dharma by the Tathāgata or disciples of the Tathāgata, is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between them concerning what they have abandoned?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, the castes are these four: kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, and śūdra. If they accept instruction, teaching, and preaching on the Dharma by the Tathāgata or disciples of the Tathāgata, is there any difference . . . concerning what they have abandoned? To clarify this, O Great King, I would ask you a question in return; you should answer as best you can.</p>
<p>“O Great King, suppose, for instance, there are four beings to be trained: an elephant, a horse, an ox, and a man. O Great King, what do you think? If two of these are not trained, not well trained, and two are trained, well trained, do the two beings who are not trained, not well trained, attain the state of those who are trained, while they are not trained? Do they receive the training of those who are well trained, while they are not well trained?”</p>
<p>“No, O Gautama, they do not.”</p>
<p>“Again, do the two beings who are trained, well trained, attain the state of those who are trained, while they are trained? Do they receive the training of those who are well trained, while they are well trained?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Gautama, they do precisely so.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, thus there is no reason that the state that a devout person should attain would be attained by an undevout person;  there is no reason that the state that an immovable, faultless, vigorous, and intelligent person should attain would be attained by a person of distorted intelligence. It is reasonable that the state that a devout person should attain would be attained by a devout person; it is reasonable that the state that an immovable, faultless, vigorous, and intelligent person should attain would be attained by an intelligent person.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, the castes are these four: kṣatriya, brahmin, vaiśya, and śūdra. If they accept instruction, teaching, and preaching on the Dharma by the Tathāgata or disciples of the Tathāgata, possess their own five qualities, and have abandoned the same thing equally, is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between the liberation of one of them and that of the others?”</p>
<p>“To clarify this, O Great King, I would ask you a question in return; you should answer as best you can.</p>
<p>“O Great King, suppose, for instance, a son of a brahmin comes from the east. Someone requests him, ‘O son of a brahmin, now make a board for fire-starting from dry sāla wood, put a spindle on it, drill it, and make fire.’ He does make a board for fire-starting from dry sāla wood, puts a spindle on it, drills it, and makes fire.</p>
<p>“A son of a kṣatriya comes from the south. Someone requests him, ‘O son of a kṣatriya, now make a board for fire-starting from dry sugarcane, put a spindle on it, drill it, and make fire.’ He does make a board for fire-starting from dry sugarcane, puts a spindle on it, drills it, and makes fire.</p>
<p>“A son of a vaiśya comes from the west. Someone requests him, ‘O son of a vaiśya, now make a board for fire-starting from dry cypress, put a spindle on it, drill it, and make fire.’ He does make a board for fire-starting from dry cypress, puts a spindle on it, drills it, and makes fire.</p>
<p>“A son of a śūdra comes from the north. Someone requests him, ‘O son of a śūdra, now make a board for fire-starting from dry sandalwood, put a spindle on it, drill it, and make fire.’ He does make a board for fire-starting from dry sandalwood, puts a spindle on it, drills it, and makes fire.</p>
<p>“O Great King, what do you think? If someone gathers these fires into one and puts them in a heap of reed or straw, is there any difference, distinction, or contrast between these fires made by people from the different castes with different kinds of wood, such as the following: ‘This fire is luminous, colorful, and bright.  That fire is not. This fire works as fire. That fire does not.’ Or are all these fires luminous, colorful, and bright? Do all these fires work as fire?”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, all those fires are luminous, colorful, and bright. All those fires work as fire.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, thus there is no difference, distinction, or contrast between these fires attained by those who are careful, made by masters, which are the liberation of one of them and the liberation of the others.”</p>
<p>“What the honorable Gautama has said is reasonable.  Now, if you would deign to answer my questions, I would ask you, honorable Gautama, about a few other points.”</p>
<p>“Great King, ask what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, do gods exist?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, how do you know what gods are like? They are either gods who have enmity, rivals, and malice, and come and will come into existence in this human world, or gods who do not have enmity, rivals, or malice, and do not come and will not come into existence in this human world. All gods fall into these two categories.”</p>
<p>“In the place where gods who have enmity, rivals, and malice, and come and will come into existence in this human world, die after their lives, acts, and merits are exhausted, can a god or son of a god make another god or son of a god die there or banish him from there?”</p>
<p>“Great King, in the place where gods who have enmity, rivals, and malice, and come and will come into existence in this human world die after their lives, acts, and merits are exhausted, a god or son of a god cannot make another god or son of a god die there or banish him from there.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, in that place, can gods who have enmity, rivals, and malice, and come and will come into existence in this human world, make gods who do not have enmity, rivals, or malice, and do not come and will not come into existence in this human world, die there or banish them from there?”</p>
<p>Then General Virūḍhaka said to King Prasenajit of Kosala, “It is likely that the śramaṇa Gautama will say that gods have extremely long lives and live for an extremely long time.”</p>
<p>At that time the venerable Ānanda was sitting behind the Blessed One, fanning him with a fan.  Then the venerable Ānanda thought, “This General Virūḍhaka is a son of King Prasenajit of Kosala, and I too am a spiritual heir of the Blessed One. Therefore, it would be appropriate if I, an heir, and he, a son, had a conversation.” So he said to General Virūḍhaka, “O General, what do you think? If King Prasenajit of Kosala is in his own country, and there his words have authority as law, can he make some person of weak power die there or banish him from there?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he can, O śramaṇa.”</p>
<p>“O General, what do you think? If King Prasenajit of Kosala is not in his own country, and there his words do not have authority as law, can he make some person of weak power die there or banish him from there?”</p>
<p>“O śramaṇa, if King Prasenajit of Kosala is not in his own country, and there his words do not have authority as law, he can neither make any person of weak power die there nor banish him from there.”</p>
<p>“O General, have you heard that the Thirty-Three Gods exist?”</p>
<p>“O śramaṇa, I have heard so from this king, the ruler of Kosala.”</p>
<p>“O General, what do you think? Can King Prasenajit of Kosala make the Thirty-Three Gods die there or banish them from there?”</p>
<p>“O śramaṇa, King Prasenajit of Kosala has not even seen or heard the Thirty-Three Gods. Thus, needless to say, he cannot make them die there or banish them from there.”</p>
<p>“O General, in the same way gods possessing malice have not even seen or heard of gods free from malice. Thus, needless to say, they cannot make them die there or banish them from there. It is impossible.”</p>
<p>Then King Prasenajit of Kosala  asked the Blessed One, “O Gautama, what is the name of this śramaṇa?”</p>
<p>“It is Ānanda, Great King.”</p>
<p>“What the honorable Ānanda said is reasonable. What the honorable Ānanda said is quite reasonable.”</p>
<p>Then King Prasenajit of Kosala said to the Blessed One, “Now, if you would deign to answer my questions, I would ask you, honorable Gautama, about a few points.”</p>
<p>“Great King, ask what you want to know.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, does Brahmā exist?”</p>
<p>“O Great King, how do you know what Brahmā is like? Which do you mean, the Brahmā who has enmity, rivals, and malice, and comes or will come into existence in this human world, or the Brahmā who does not have enmity, rivals, or malice, and does not come and will not come into existence in this human world?”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, of these, I know that the one who does not have enmity, rivals, or malice, and does not come and will not come into existence in this human world, is Brahmā.”</p>
<p>King Prasenajit of Kosala had such a conversation with the Blessed One. Then that man who had been dispatched before came back to the king with the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky. When he had arrived, he said to King Prasenajit of Kosala, “He is here, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Then the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky, wished King Prasenajit of Kosala victory and long life and sat down to one side. When the young brahmin Saṃjaya had sat down to one side, King Prasenajit of Kosala asked him, “Young brahmin, do you remember who told the story that the śramaṇa Gautama said, ‘It is impossible, out of the question, that other śramaṇas or brahmins know or  see everything’ one day in the past, when the king, ministers, and the king’s attendants were sitting together in the royal palace?”</p>
<p>“I remember, Your Majesty, that General Virūḍhaka said this.”</p>
<p>General Virūḍhaka countered, “It was the young brahmin Saṃjaya, the son of Lucky, who said this.”</p>
<p>They thus laid the blame on each other. Then a servant of King Prasenajit of Kosala said to the king, “Your Majesty, it is time to depart. Your Majesty, it is time.”</p>
<p>King Prasenajit of Kosala then said to the Blessed One, “O honorable Gautama, I asked you a question about the state of knowing everything, and the honorable Gautama answered my question about the state of knowing everything. Here I asked the honorable Gautama questions about the pure caste, the superior gods, and the superior Brahmā, and the honorable Gautama answered up to my question about the superior Brahmā. Since the honorable Gautama has answered every question of mine that I asked, what else do I have to ask the honorable Gautama? O honorable Gautama, I will now depart, for I have much business and many things to do.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, you should know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>Then King Prasenajit of Kosala rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>V. Śrāvastī</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived at Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When the householder Anāthapiṇḍada heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, had arrived at Śrāvastī  and was staying in his own park near Śrāvastī, he went to see the Blessed One. Upon the householder’s arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍada. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍada in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent.  Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” . . . He took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍada. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the householder Anāthapiṇḍada in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>Other brahmins and householders also offered meals to the Blessed One and the community of disciples from time to time. When the monks gave some food to beggars before they ate,  the brahmins and householders criticized this. The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, who said to them, “You should give the leftovers in the bowls after you have eaten for yourselves.”</p>
<p>There were two beggars there, a brahmin boy and a kṣatriya boy. The brahmin boy, not knowing the appropriate time, went about begging first. But the monks did not give him any food at all. When the kṣatriya boy went about begging later, he obtained much. He asked the brahmin boy, “Did you not obtain anything?”</p>
<p>The brahmin boy was enraged and shouted, “If I had power, I would cut off the head of every śramaṇa who is a son of the Śākyans and hurl it to the ground!”</p>
<p>The kṣatriya boy said, “If I had wealth, I would offer a meal of a hundred kinds of flavors to the community of monks headed by the Buddha every day.”</p>
<p>The two boys, talking in these ways, left Śrāvastī and lay under a tree. A straying chariot rolled by that place and ran over the brahmin boy’s head. Then the Blessed One spoke a verse about this event:</p>
<p>“Mind goes before all other things. Mind is foremost.</p>
<p>Mind is swift. If one speaks or acts with an angry mind,</p>
<p>He will suffer pain,</p>
<p>As if his head has been cut off by a stray chariot wheel.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, what did you mean, saying that?”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, did you see that the brahmin boy out of malice spoke harsh words toward the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“Out of malice, having spoken harsh words toward the community of monks headed by the Buddha, he left Śrāvastī and lay under a tree.  A straying chariot ran over his head. Therefore, I thought and said thus: ‘Mind goes before all other things. Mind is foremost . . . . He will suffer pain, as if his head has been cut off by a stray chariot wheel.’ ”</p>
<p>At that time the head of a guild in Śrāvastī died sonless. Brahmins and householders in Śrāvastī met together and wondered, “Who should we appoint as head of the guild?”</p>
<p>One among them suggested, “It should be someone who possesses great merits.”</p>
<p>“How could we know that?”</p>
<p>“We must investigate.”</p>
<p>They did investigate, and saw that while the kṣatriya boy was lying under the tree and the shadows of other trees were going to move, were moving, and had moved from previous locations, the shadow of that tree did not move from the boy’s body. They promoted him to head of the guild. He thought, “All my fortune and glory is due to the Buddha, the Blessed One. Now I will invite the Blessed One together with the community of disciples to a meal.”</p>
<p>He went to see the Blessed One, and upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the head of the guild. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the young head of the guild in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, the Blessed One remained silent.</p>
<p>Then the head of the guild rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder,  made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” . . .  He took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. . . . With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community, may you accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the young head of the guild through talk consistent with the Dharma, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. He then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“Mind goes before all other things. Mind is foremost.</p>
<p>Mind is swift. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,</p>
<p>He will experience happiness,</p>
<p>As the shadow does not move from him.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, what is the meaning of these words of yours?”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, did you see how the kṣatriya boy regarded the community of monks headed by the Buddha with a pure mind?”</p>
<p>“Yes, O Honored One, I did.”</p>
<p>“When he left Vaiśālī and lay under a tree, harboring such pure regard for the community of monks headed by the Buddha, he was promoted to head of the guild by the brahmins and householders of Vaiśālī and gained many possessions in this very life. Therefore, I thought and said, ‘Mind goes before all other things. Mind is foremost. . . . He will experience happiness, as the shadow does not move from him.’ ”</p>
<p>VI. Valaya</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in Valaya, in Valaya . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail) . . . .</p>
<p>VII. Where There Is Ground</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in Where There Is Ground, in Where There Is Ground . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited) . . . .</p>
<p>VIII. Lion Village</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in Lion Village, in Lion Village . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail) . . . .</p>
<p>IX. New Village</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in New Village, in New Village . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited) . . . .</p>
<p>X. City</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in Where There Is a City, in Where There Is a City . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited) . . . .</p>
<p>XI. Pīṭha</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in Rājagṛha. At that time, a wandering mendicant named Pīṭha was staying on the bank of Sumāgadhā Pond. He caught fish with a hook and ate them at night. After dawn, he sat on a small seat placed on another small seat and spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“A man who, living with the best Dharma among other Dharmas,</p>
<p>Does not harm any beings will be a monk.</p>
<p>A man who, with a pacified mind, practices relinquishment, maintains vows,</p>
<p>And is self-controlled is suited to tranquility.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert the mendicant, went to him  and said:</p>
<p>“If you are just like</p>
<p>The one described in the verse,</p>
<p>You are suited to being counted as an excellent one.</p>
<p>But you are not, as regards relinquishment.</p>
<p>“First, one who is pacified and self-controlled,</p>
<p>And does not harm any beings,</p>
<p>And, with a pacified mind, practices relinquishment, maintains vows,</p>
<p>And is self-controlled is suited to tranquility.</p>
<p>“One who does not act wickedly</p>
<p>With his body, speech, or mind,</p>
<p>Who is controlled by the three bases</p>
<p>And self-controlled, is suited to tranquility.”</p>
<p>Then the wandering mendicant Pīṭha thought, “My mind was known by the śramaṇa Gautama’s mind,” and he was filled with faith.</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. When the wandering mendicant Pīṭha had heard the Dharma . . . . With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>The monks had seen him sitting on a small seat placed on another small seat. Then a monk heard the Dharma, sitting on a small seat placed on another small seat, but he did not see the truths even though he was already a vessel of the truths. The Blessed One thought, “Why did this monk not see the truths?” He understood that the reason was haughtiness. Then the Blessed One thought, “The fault that occurred in this case was that the monk sat on a small seat placed on another small seat.”</p>
<p>He said, “Therefore, a monk should not sit on a small seat placed on another small seat. If he does so, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>XII. Nyagrodhikā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, having arrived in Nyagrodhikā from Rājagṛha, dressed early in the morning, took his robe and  his bowl, and entered Nyagrodhikā for alms.</p>
<p>There was a daughter of a brahmin from Kapilavastu married to a man in Nyagrodhikā. The daughter of the brahmin saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns. As soon as she saw him, she thought, “Though this Blessed One was a son of the lineage of Śākyans, he abandoned the throne of a wheel-turning king and also abandoned many consorts and storehouses full of treasures and went forth. He is now going for alms. If he will accept almsfood from me, I will offer him almsfood.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing her mind, held out his bowl and said, “Sister, if you will give me almsfood, put it into this bowl.”</p>
<p>Then great faith arose in her. When she thought, “My mind was known by the Blessed One’s mind,” and offered almsfood to the Blessed One with strong faith, the Blessed One smiled.</p>
<p>It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile . . . . Those rays disappeared between his eyebrows.  Then the venerable Ānanda made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said, “The Buddhas . . . do not without cause . . . .”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “. . . do not smile . . . . Ānanda, did you see that the daughter of a brahmin, faith having arisen in her, offered me almsfood?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, by this root of merit, this daughter of a brahmin will transmigrate for thirteen eons,  never being reborn in inferior modes of existence, but being reborn among gods and humans, and she will become a self-awakened one named Supraṇihita in her last life, last birth, last body, last taking up of an identity.”</p>
<p>Then there was a loud shout: “The daughter of the brahmin So-and-so offered almsfood to the Blessed One out of faith. The Blessed One predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one!”</p>
<p>The husband of that woman was in the wilderness, collecting flowers and firewood. He heard that his wife had offered almsfood to the śramaṇa Gautama and he had predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one. Unable to bear hearing this, he went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he asked the Blessed One, “O honorable Gautama, did you go to my house?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, O brahmin.”</p>
<p>“O honorable Gautama, is it true that my wife offered you almsfood and you predicted her awakening as a self-awakened one?”</p>
<p>“It is true, O brahmin.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, you have abandoned the throne of a wheel-turning king and gone forth. Now why did you knowingly speak false words for the sake of just almsfood? Who believes your words that such a small cause leads to such a result?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, let me ask you something in return; you should answer as best you can. O brahmin, what do you think? Have you ever seen any wonder or marvel?”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, apart from other wonders and marvels, listen to me first about the wonder and marvel I have seen in this very Nyagrodhikā. O Gautama, there is a large banyan tree (nyagrodha) in the eastern part of this Nyagrodhikā. This village is called Nyagrodhikā after the name of that tree. Under the tree, five hundred chariots can be accommodated without touching each other or being stacked on top of each other.”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, how big was the seed of the banyan tree? As big as a field?”</p>
<p>“No, it was not, O Gautama.”</p>
<p>“As big as a mat, a sesame-oil mill, the wheel of a chariot, a cowhide, the fruit of a bilva tree, or the fruit of a kapittha tree?”</p>
<p>“No, it was not, O Gautama. O Gautama, it was at first about one-fourth of a mustard seed.”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, who would believe your words that such a small seed has led to such a result, that gigantic tree?”</p>
<p>“O honorable Gautama, believe it or not, I saw it myself. O Gautama, if a fresh, good seed is correctly planted in an undamaged field, the soil of which is soft and sweet, and the gods bring rain at the appropriate times, then this gigantic banyan tree will grow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then spoke some verses about this subject:</p>
<p>“O brahmin, as you see</p>
<p>Fields and seeds,</p>
<p>The Tathāgata sees</p>
<p>Actions ripen.</p>
<p>“O brahmin, as you see</p>
<p>The small seed and the very large tree,</p>
<p>O brahmin, I also see</p>
<p>The small seed and its great result.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One darted his tongue out of his mouth, and it covered his whole face up to his hairline. He said to the brahmin, “O brahmin, what do you think? Does one whose tongue, darting out of his mouth, covers his whole face knowingly speak false words even for the sake of the throne of a wheel-turning king?”</p>
<p>“No, he does not, O Gautama.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then spoke another verse:</p>
<p>“My tongue tells no lie; it has been generated by truthfulness.</p>
<p>How could it speak what is not true?</p>
<p>O brahmin, I am the Tathāgata, ‘truly come,’</p>
<p>Because what I say is true. Thus should you understand.”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin had faith. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature . . . .  With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>

<p>Nandivardhana.</p>
<p>These are correctly explained.</p>
<p>I. Kimpilā</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in Kimpilā and stayed in Kimpilā Forest.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Kimpila, “O Kimpila, I will teach you to meditate on the four applications of mindfulness. Listen to it well and keep it in mind; I shall teach it.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had said this, the venerable Kimpila remained silent. He remained so when the Blessed One said it a second time and a third time. Then the venerable Ānanda said to the venerable Kimpila, “Venerable  Kimpila, the Teacher is speaking to you.”</p>
<p>“I know, O Venerable Ānanda. I know well, O Venerable Ānanda.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, it is the right time. O Sugata, it is the right time. If the Blessed One teaches the monks to meditate on the four applications of mindfulness, the monks will listen to it and grasp it.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, then listen to it well and keep it in mind; I shall teach it.</p>
<p>“Here a monk, in a village or town . . . when he has mindfully breathed in, he knows that he has breathed in . . . . He knows that he has breathed out, observing cessation.</p>
<p>“When a noble disciple, having mindfully breathed in, knows that he has mindfully breathed in . . . he knows that he has, with his bodily formations made supple, breathed out, observing the body in the body, the noble disciple dwells, observing the body in the body. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, suppose, for instance, a stūpa is built out of dirt at the crossroads of main streets and then someone roaming by vehicle, palanquin, or chariot comes there from the east. What do you think, Ānanda? Will the dirt stūpa disintegrate?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“In the same way, when a noble disciple learns that he has mindfully breathed in . . . he knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“When a noble disciple, experiencing pleasure . . . knows that he has, with his mental formations  made supple, breathed out, observing perception in perception, the noble disciple dwells, observing perception in perception. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, suppose, for instance, a stūpa is built out of dirt at the crossroads of main streets and then someone roaming by vehicle, palanquin, or chariot comes there from the south . . . observing perception in perception. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“When a noble disciple has experienced his mind and breathed in, with his mind pleased, concentrated, and liberated, he knows that he has breathed in with his mind liberated; and, having breathed out with his mind liberated, he knows that he has breathed out with his mind liberated, and he dwells, observing his mind in his mind. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.”</p>
<p>(The parable of the stūpa and a vehicle, and so forth, from the west should be narrated here.)</p>
<p>“Because both his longing and despair have disappeared in his body, perception, and mind, he dwells in equanimity, observing mental objects in mental objects. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Suppose, for instance, a stūpa is built out of dirt at the crossroads of main streets and then someone roaming by vehicle, palanquin, or chariot comes there from the north. Ānanda, what do you think? Will the dirt stūpa disintegrate?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“In the same way . . . observing mental objects in mental objects. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, if he is thus, he is said to have meditated on the four applications of mindfulness.”</p>
<p>II. Ahicchattra</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One arrived at a hamlet, wherein was the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s uncle, who had gone forth among ṛṣis. Since the Blessed One thought that the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana ought to convert this ṛṣi, he instructed the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, think about your uncle.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana to the Blessed One. He knew the time to convert his uncle had come and tried to enter the hermitage of the ṛṣis.</p>
<p>Then the ṛṣi said, “O śramaṇa, stop. You should not enter this hermitage of brahmins.”</p>
<p>“I am a brahmin, too,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana.</p>
<p>The ṛṣi then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“O brahmin, you have neither the sacred grass</p>
<p>Nor a ladle for burnt offerings.</p>
<p>You are bald and you do not perform fire offerings.</p>
<p>Why do you say that you are a brahmin?”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana spoke some verses in reply:</p>
<p>“O brahmin, it is my sacred grass</p>
<p>To know shame; my ladle is my knowledge;</p>
<p>My faith, which is like constantly flowing water,</p>
<p>Is my water jar;</p>
<p>“The truth is my fire offering,</p>
<p>I who am well concentrated within.</p>
<p>Correctly restrained and self-controlled,</p>
<p>I burn offerings by day and by night.”</p>
<p>“Even if that is so,” said the ṛṣi, “a shaven-headed śramaṇa is not permitted here.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana caused a storm. He went near a lake, approached a tree, and sat under it. There lived an attendant of the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda. The nāga thought, “This is the noble one Mahā­maudgalyāyana, whom the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda respect. Now I will make an effort to venerate him.” The nāga left his residence  and sat, encircling the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s body seven times and raising his hood over the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s head.</p>
<p>It is commonplace among ṛṣis that if one is not concerned about another’s pain, one ceases being a ṛṣi. Therefore, the ṛṣi thought, “If that mendicant dies in the storm and I cease being a ṛṣi, that would not be appropriate.” He then left the hermitage and tried to find him. He saw the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana and said, “O mendicant, enter our hermitage.”</p>
<p>“O great ṛṣi, did you cease being a ṛṣi?” asked the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana.</p>
<p>The ṛṣi recognized his voice and asked in return, “Are you the noble one Mahā­maudgalyāyana?”</p>
<p>“O ṛṣi, people know me thus.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, for what purpose did you come here?”</p>
<p>“I came for the very purpose of your conversion. Now let us go to the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana then took his uncle to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the Blessed One, “This is my uncle, who has gone forth among ṛṣis. The Blessed One should preach the Dharma for him.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew the ṛṣi’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him. Having heard the Dharma, the ṛṣi actualized the fruit of a never-returner. He rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.  I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One ordained him by saying “Come, monk,” . . . .</p>
<p>Because the Tathāgata said “Come,”</p>
<p>His hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe,</p>
<p>His faculties at once calmed,</p>
<p>And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana had left, the nāga felt lonely and unhappy. He caused various epidemics in the hamlet and, dressed as a ṛṣi, went to the hermitage and dwelled there. Then the people of the hamlet came to the hermitage and said, “O great ṛṣi, such epidemics have befallen us. What should we do?”</p>
<p>“Come and stay in this place,” replied the ṛṣi, “and the epidemics will be quelled.”</p>
<p>The people of the hamlet then went to that place and dwelled there. Because the serpent (ahi) had served as an umbrella (chattra) there, the place became famous as Ahicchattra, and devout people built a monastery and provided it with all the requisites.</p>
<p>III. Mathurā</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, arrived in Mathurā and stayed in the mango forest of practitioners undergoing training on the bank of the river Prabhadrikā.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, you should rely on the island that is yourself, the refuge that is yourself, the island that is the Dharma, the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges. Monks, you should correctly learn that you should rely on the island that is yourself, the refuge that is yourself, the island that is the Dharma, the refuge that is the Dharma, and not on other islands or other refuges.</p>
<p>“What are sorrow, lamentation,  pain, despair, and distress like? Being attached to something, people observe it as self, and hence, on account of it, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress that have not yet arisen will arise for these people, and such things that have already arisen will increase and grow. Why is this?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, since the Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the Blessed One is the Leader, and the Blessed One is the Teacher, may the Blessed One teach the meaning of this to the monks. The monks will listen to it from the Blessed One and grasp it.”</p>
<p>“O monks, then listen to it well and keep it in mind; I shall teach it.</p>
<p>“O monks, when there are visual objects and people are attached to visual objects and observe visual objects as self, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress that have not yet arisen will arise for these people, and such things that have already arisen will increase and grow.</p>
<p>“O monks, when there are feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, and people are attached to consciousness and observe consciousness as self, sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress that have not yet arisen will arise for these people, and such things that have already arisen will increase and grow.</p>
<p>“O monks, look . . . . When . . . he knows that he has breathed in, observing perception in perception, the noble disciple dwells, observing perception in perception. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Suppose, for instance, Ānanda, a stūpa is built out of dirt at the crossroads of main streets and then someone roaming by vehicle, palanquin, or chariot comes there from the south . . . observing perception in perception. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“When a noble disciple knows that he has experienced his mind and breathed in, with his mind pleased, concentrated, and liberated, and, having breathed out with his mind liberated, knows that he has breathed out with his mind liberated and observes his mind in his mind, the noble disciple dwells, observing his mind in his mind. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.”</p>
<p>(The parable of the stūpa and a vehicle, and so forth, from the west should be narrated here.)</p>
<p>“Because both his longing and despair have disappeared in the body, perception, and mind, he dwells in equanimity, observing mental objects in mental objects. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that his mind is concentrated inwardly.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, what do you think? Suppose, for instance, a stūpa is built out of dirt at the crossroads of main streets and then someone roaming by vehicle, palanquin, or chariot comes there from the north, will the dirt stūpa disintegrate?</p>
<p>“Yes, it will, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“In the same way . . . observing mental objects in mental objects. When he thus dwells, the noble disciple knows that the inner concentration of mind exists.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, if he is thus, he is said to have meditated on the four applications of mindfulness.”</p>
<p>IV. Rāṣṭrapāla</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kuru, arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka,  and stayed in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.</p>
<p>When the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kuru, had arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka and was staying in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, they met together, flocked together, left Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, and went to the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.</p>
<p>At that time, a householder’s son named Rāṣṭrapāla was sitting in the assembly. Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, thought, “If I correctly understand the meaning of what the Blessed One has said, it is difficult for laymen, who live at home, to lead the pure life, which is totally pure, unmixed, complete, completely pure, and clean, throughout their lives. Now I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.”</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, he remained silent.  The brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka then rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. They bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>As soon as the brahmins and householders in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka had departed, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“O son of a householder, have your parents permitted it?”</p>
<p>“No, they have not, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“O son of a householder, the Tathāgata and the disciples of the Tathāgata neither let anyone go forth nor ordain him while he does not have his parents’ permission.”</p>
<p>“In that case, O Honored One, I will try to gain permission from my parents.”</p>
<p>Then Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, praised and was delighted at the words of the Blessed One and went home. When he had arrived, he said to his parents, “Father, Mother, please be informed that I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith.”</p>
<p>“Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are our only, dear, sweet, darling son, who has never disobeyed us. If you die, we will have to part from you unwillingly. But where would we let you go while you are still alive?”</p>
<p>“Father, Mother, if you permit this right now, that’s fine. But if you do not permit this, I will neither have a meal nor pay obeisance to you from today onward.”</p>
<p>Then Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder,  fasted for a day. After that, he fasted for two days, for three days—all the way to seven days. Then the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla said to him, “Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate, you desire comfort, and you have not known pain. It is difficult to lead the pure life, it is difficult to practice in complete seclusion, it is difficult to rejoice in solitude, and it is unbearable to live in a dwelling in the wilderness, in a forest, or on the outskirts of a town. Stay here, our son Rāṣṭrapāla, and enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.”</p>
<p>Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. The parents of Rāṣṭrapāla then asked their relatives for help: “O relatives, make our son Rāṣṭrapāla come to his senses at once.”</p>
<p>Then the relatives of Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, went to Rāṣṭrapāla. When they had arrived, they said to him, “Son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate; you desire comfort . . . , and make merit.”</p>
<p>Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. Then the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla asked Rāṣṭrapāla’s friends for help: “O sons, make our son Rāṣṭrapāla come to his senses at once.”</p>
<p>Then the friends of Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, said to Rāṣṭrapāla, “Good son Rāṣṭrapāla, understand this: You are delicate; you desire comfort . . . , and make merit.”</p>
<p>Even when told this, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, remained silent. Then  the friends said to the parents of Rāṣṭrapāla, “Father and mother, what use is there in letting this son Rāṣṭrapāla die? Permit him to go forth. Then, if he rejoices in the pure life, you will be able to see him alive; if he does not rejoice in it, to whom will the son go but to his parents?”</p>
<p>“Sons, if he lets us see him after he has gone forth, we will permit this.”</p>
<p>Then the friends said to Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, “Good son Rāṣṭrapāla, be informed that your parents permit this. They say, ‘If our son lets us see him after he has gone forth.’ ”</p>
<p>“Sirs, I will let them see me.”</p>
<p>Thereafter Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, having gradually recovered his bodily strength and power, went to the Blessed One. When he had arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I was given permission by my parents. Therefore, O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, went forth and was ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. Then the Blessed One, having let Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a householder, go forth and ordained him, and having stayed in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka as long as he wished, traveled to Śrāvastī. In due course he arrived at Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>Ten years after his ordination, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla attained the state of an arhat. Having savored the joy and happiness of liberation, he thought, “Once when I was a layman, I promised my parents to see them after I had gone forth. Now I will carry out my promise.”</p>
<p>The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then went to the Blessed One. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, once when I was a layman, I promised my parents I would see them. Now I will go to carry out my promise.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One made his mind penetrate the mind of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. When it had penetrated it, he concentrated his mind on the mind of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, and then he thought, “It is impossible that Rāṣṭrapāla, the son of a noble family, will dwell at home again or enjoy the objects of desire by hoarding,” and so he said to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, “Rāṣṭrapāla, go and liberate beings who have not been liberated. Release those who have not been released. Relieve those who have not been relieved. Emancipate those who have not been emancipated.”</p>
<p>The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then praised and delighted in the words of the Blessed One. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>After that night had passed, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Śrāvastī for alms.  He took a meal of alms in Śrāvastī and returned after the meal. He put in order the bedding and the seat he had used and set out for Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. As he traveled, in due course he arrived at Sthūlakoṣṭhaka and stayed in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, after that next night had passed, dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Sthūlakoṣṭhaka for alms. Going for alms in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, in due course he went to his own home. At that time, a barber was arranging the hair and beard of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father in the courtyard, and his father saw the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla standing before the gate. When he saw him, the father scolded him: “You shaven-headed śramaṇa, you have destroyed my family line. You made Rāṣṭrapāla, my only, dear, sweet, darling son, who had never disobeyed me, go forth and then ordained him. You shaven-headed śramaṇa, who is going to give you almsfood?”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, having gotten no offering but abuse, left his own home before he was chased away. At that time an old woman, who had once been a slave of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, came out the door, carrying spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa in order to throw it away. When the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla saw the old woman, his former slave, he said to her, “Sister, if you are throwing away that spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa, I will eat it. Please put it in this bowl.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, please have it.”</p>
<p>Putting the spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa in the bowl, the old woman, his former slave,  then recognized the characteristics of the hands, feet, face, nose, and way of speaking of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. She asked, “Sir, are you Rāṣṭrapāla?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sister. People know me thus.”</p>
<p>Then the old woman, his former slave, hurried to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father. When she arrived, she said to him, “Sir, please be informed that your son Rāṣṭrapāla arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka long before, but he would not enter his own home.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father, holding his hair with his left hand and wearing nothing but his loincloth, rushed to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. At that time the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla was sitting by the wall and eating the spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa. Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father asked him, “Rāṣṭrapāla, why do you not enter your own home despite having arrived in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka long before? Why are you eating that spoiled, day-old kulmāṣa?”</p>
<p>“O householder, when I came to your house, I got no offering but abuse, and had to leave before I was chased away.”</p>
<p>“I did not know it was my son Rāṣṭrapāla. If I had known, I would not have said such a thing. My son Rāṣṭrapāla, forgive me.”</p>
<p>“I forgive you, O householder.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s father firmly embraced him and had him sit on a seat prepared in his own home. The father then said to Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother, “Our son Rāṣṭrapāla has come back  home after a long time. Oh, cook and prepare a meal immediately. Our son Rāṣṭrapāla will eat it.”</p>
<p>The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother then cooked and prepared a meal herself. Then a man piled pieces of gold in such a large heap that someone standing behind it could not see another standing before it, and someone standing before it could not see another standing behind it. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother said to him, “My son Rāṣṭrapāla, your mother has this amount of what is called dowry, dower, or marriage portion. Your father has also accumulated gold—and hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of fine grains of gold—not to mention other things. My son Rāṣṭrapāla, now stay here and enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.”</p>
<p>“O householder’s wife, if you will listen to my words with faith, I will instruct and teach you.”</p>
<p>“My son Rāṣṭrapāla, instruct me. My son Rāṣṭrapāla, teach me. I will listen to your words with faith.”</p>
<p>“O householder’s wife, now make new bags with linen, put the gold and fine grains of gold into them, load them on to a carriage, and throw them in a deep, rapid stream in the Ganges. Your sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and distress have arisen from those roots.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s mother thought, “I am not able to turn back my son Rāṣṭrapāla in this way.”  The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla's mother then urged her daughter-in-law to help: “O my daughter, anoint your body with incense, bathe, wear various scents, dress yourself, adorn yourself with adornments, burn various kinds of incense, and scatter incense powder immediately, just as you once pleased and comforted my son Rāṣṭrapāla in that way when he was a layman. Then throw yourself at my son Rāṣṭrapāla’s feet and say, ‘What are the celestial nymphs like, for the sake of whom you have led the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One?’ ”</p>
<p>Then the former wife of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla did anoint her body with incense, bathed, wore various scents, dressed herself, adorned herself with adornments, burned various kinds of incense, and scattered incense powder just as she had once pleased and comforted the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla in that way when he was a layman. She then threw herself at the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla’s feet and said, “What are the celestial nymphs like, for the sake of whom you have led the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One?”</p>
<p>“O sister, it is not for the sake of celestial nymphs that I have led the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Then, because the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla  addressed his former wife as sister, she fainted and fell to the ground. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then said to his parents, “Father, Mother, why do you not give me food if you were going to give it? Why leave it and torment me?”</p>
<p>“Our son Rāṣṭrapāla, have it.”</p>
<p>Then the parents with their own hands served and satisfied the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla with a pure and fine meal. When, with their own hands, they had served and satisfied him in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, they took low seats, and sat before the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla in order to hear the Dharma. The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla then spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“Look, even though a body is decorated</p>
<p>With jewels and earrings,</p>
<p>It has illness along with its seductive nature</p>
<p>And never remains stable.</p>
<p>“Eight braids of hair</p>
<p>And eyes lined with collyrium</p>
<p>May delude ignorant people,</p>
<p>But they cannot delude those who seek what is beyond.</p>
<p>“A body anointed with perfumes</p>
<p>And feet smeared with red chalk</p>
<p>May delude ignorant people,</p>
<p>But they cannot delude those who seek what is beyond.</p>
<p>“Eyes painted with fresh collyrium</p>
<p>And a decorated rotten body</p>
<p>May delude ignorant people,</p>
<p>But they cannot delude those who seek what is beyond.</p>
<p>“A hunter cannot catch a deer that has escaped</p>
<p>In spite of a snare laid; in just the same way,</p>
<p>Leaving the hunter wailing, you should</p>
<p>Eat and leave for your dwelling place.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted his parents. Thereupon he flew away across the sky, and the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla  went to Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest. When he had arrived, he sat under a vibhītaka tree, in order to pass the day there.</p>
<p>At that time, King Kauravya had often been talking about the fame of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla and said, “I will meet the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla personally sometime. I will ask him a question sometime, if he would deign to answer.” Then King Kauravya ordered a forest custodian, “My man, go and very quickly clean Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest. I will take a stroll there tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to King Kauravya, and he cleaned all of Sthūlakoṣṭhaka Forest. When the man saw the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla sitting under the vibhītaka tree, passing the day, he thought, “Here is the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, whose fame King Kauravya has repeatedly talked about and about whom he has said, ‘I will meet the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla personally sometime. I will ask him a question sometime, if he would deign to answer.’ He has arrived at such-and-such a place near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. I will now inform King Kauravya.”</p>
<p>Then the man went to King Kauravya. When he had arrived, he said to the king, “The venerable Rāṣṭrapāla is here, the one whose fame Your Majesty has repeatedly talked about and about whom you have said, ‘I will meet the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla personally sometime. I will ask him a question sometime, if he would deign to answer.’ He has arrived at such-and-such a place near Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. May Your Majesty know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>King Kauravya then ordered another man, “My man,  now quickly prepare a beautiful vehicle. I will ride in it and go to see the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla today.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Your Majesty,” replied the man to King Kauravya. Then, having quickly prepared the beautiful vehicle, he returned to King Kauravya. When he had arrived, he said to King Kauravya, “Your Majesty, the vehicle is ready. May Your Majesty know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>King Kauravya then rode in the beautiful vehicle, left Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, and went to see and serve the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. Having gone as far as he could go by vehicle, he alighted from the vehicle and entered the park on foot. When the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla saw King Kauravya coming from a distance, he said, “Welcome, Great King. Now, Great King, since this is your country, please invite me to a seat if you so like.”</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, my country it is, but I ask you, Rāṣṭrapāla, to invite me to a seat.”</p>
<p>“Then, Great King, here is a seat for you. Please sit down, if you so like.”</p>
<p>Face to face with the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, King Kauravya then made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, and sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, King Kauravya said to the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, “O honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, if one belongs to a lowly family, has run through his entire possessions, or has become old, he might go forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. Since we belong to the Kauravya family and our possessions are abundant, I have thus allotted  a portion of our possessions to the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla. O honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, stay here now, enjoy the objects of desire, give donations, and make merit.”</p>
<p>“The Great King has invited me in an inappropriate way, not in an appropriate way. One like you must not invite a learned man like me in such a way.”</p>
<p>“How should I invite you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, if in an appropriate way?”</p>
<p>“Great King, if you were now to say, ‘O Rāṣṭrapāla, my country is rich and free from harm, calamity, and danger, and there it is easy to obtain almsfood; O honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, stay in this Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, and I will protect, shelter, and guard you in accordance with the Dharma,’ O Great King, that I would wish. Such is said only by one with a faithful mind.”</p>
<p>“If you would deign to answer my questions, I would ask some questions of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, ask. I will explain after listening.”</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, there are four kinds of decay; because they have decayed through these, sons of noble families will go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes. What are the four? Decay through old age, decay through illness, decay in terms of relatives, and decay in terms of possessions.</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, what is decay through old age? Here a son of a noble family, having become old and decrepit, thinks, ‘Now, since I am old and decrepit, I cannot easily enjoy even the objects of desire that I possess right now,  let alone what I do not possess. Now I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.’ Because he has decayed through old age, he will go forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. This is said to be decay through old age.</p>
<p>“Though you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, had not decayed through old age, you went forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes. Why? You, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are young, junior, youthful, with black hair, in the prime of youth. While you should be involved in play, pleasure, fun, adornment, and decoration, you instead went forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes, though your relatives were choked with tears, crying, and not happy. What did you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, know, see, hear, and understand so that you went forth in that way? I am not pleased with this; I cannot bear this.</p>
<p>“O honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, what is decay through illness? Here a son of a noble family has become seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness, and thinks, ‘Since I am seriously ill, afflicted with a painful illness, I cannot easily enjoy even the objects of desire that I possess right now, let alone what I do not possess. Now I will go forth . . . , having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.’ Because he has decayed through illness, he will go forth . . . , having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. This is  said to be decay through illness.</p>
<p>“Though you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, had not decayed through illness, you went forth . . . with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes. Why? You, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are free from harm, free from illness, and your temperature is in a good state, neither too cold nor too hot but healthy and free from harm. You will safely digest foods, drink—whatever you eat, and whatever you taste. What did you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, know, see . . . so that you went forth . . .? I am not pleased with this; I cannot bear this.</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, what is decay in terms of relatives? Here a son of a noble family, after his relatives have died and gone, thinks, ‘Since my relatives have died and gone, now I will go forth . . . , having shaved off my hair and beard . . . .’ Because he has decayed in terms of relatives, he will go forth . . . , having shaved off his hair and beard . . . . This is said to be decay through relatives.</p>
<p>“Though you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, had not decayed in terms of relatives, you went forth . . . with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes. Why? Rāṣṭrapāla, your relatives originate from the Kauravya family, and they are prospering in this Sthūlakoṣṭhaka. What did you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, know, see . . . so that you went forth . . .? I am not pleased with this; I cannot bear this.</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, what is decay in terms of possessions?  Here a son of a noble family, after his possessions have become few and exhausted and have run out, thinks, ‘Since my possessions are few and exhausted and have run out, now I will go forth . . . , having shaved off my hair and beard . . . .’ Because he has decayed in terms of possessions, he will go forth . . . , having shaved off his hair and beard . . . . This is said to be decay in terms of possessions.</p>
<p>“Though you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, had not decayed in terms of possessions, you went forth . . . . Since you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, belong to the best and most excellent family in this Sthūlakoṣṭhaka, you have many possessions. What did you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, know, see, hear, and understand so that you went forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes? I am not pleased with this; I cannot bear this.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, that Blessed One, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Awakened One, the one who knows and sees, said that these four are paths for aversion to the world. By these aversions to the world, sons of noble families will go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes. Great King, all beings of this world are led by old age; beings of this world have no refuge because they have no one to follow them; beings of this world have no possessions because they must leave everyone; and beings of this world are never satisfied because they do not know contentment and are slaves to desire. Thus I knew, saw, heard, and understood, and then I went forth in that way.”</p>
<p>“I do not fully understand the meaning of what you have briefly said but have not elucidated sufficiently. May the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla explain in detail the meaning of what he has briefly said but has not elucidated sufficiently so that I may fully understand it. The honorable Rāṣṭrapāla said that all beings of this world are led by old age. Thinking of what, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, did you say this?”</p>
<p>“Great King, I will ask you something in return. Please answer as best you can. O Great King, what do you think? Do you see the age, figure, power, strength, height, and waist measurement of your present body as being equal to those of your body at the age of twenty or twenty-five years, when you were young, junior, youthful, with black hair, in the prime of youth?”</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, I do not see the age, figure, power, strength, height, and waist measurement of my present body as being equal to those of my body at the age of twenty or twenty-five years, when I was young, junior, youthful, with black hair, in the prime of youth. Now I am eighty years old and have become decrepit. Sometimes I need help from others even with sitting and standing.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, having thought on this, the Blessed One, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Awakened One, the one who knows and sees, said that all beings of this world are led by old age. Having known, seen, heard, and understood this, I went forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes. I am pleased with this and I bear it.”</p>
<p>“I too am pleased with and bear what you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are pleased with and bear.</p>
<p>“The honorable Rāṣṭrapāla also said that beings of this world have no refuge because they have no one to follow them. I have sons, wives, slaves, workmen, jesters, barbers, bath attendants, horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen, charioteers, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, and brave, bold princes like praskandins and great nagnas, who conquer my enemies, adversaries, and foes. However, the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla said that beings of this world have no refuge because they have no one to follow them. Thinking of what, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, did you say this?”</p>
<p>“Great King, I will ask you something in return. Please answer as best you can. O Great King, do you have any trouble in your body now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, O Rāṣṭrapāla, I do. An illness of the wind afflicts my back now.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, when an illness of the wind afflicts your back, if you say, ‘O my sons, wives, slaves, workmen, jesters, barbers, bath attendants, horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen, charioteers, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, and brave, bold princes like praskandins and great nagnas, now end the violent, acute, hot, intolerable, and unpleasant pain that has befallen me,’ can they do so?”</p>
<p>“No, O Rāṣṭrapāla, they cannot. When an illness of wind afflicts my back, if I say, ‘O my sons, wives, slaves, workmen, jesters, barbers, bath attendants, horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen, charioteers, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, and brave, bold princes like praskandins and great nagnas, now end the violent, acute, hot, intolerable, and unpleasant pain that has befallen me,’  they cannot do so. At that time, I will experience the violent, acute, hot, intolerable, and unpleasant pain by myself.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, having thought on this, the Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Awakened One, the one who knows and sees, said that beings of this world have no refuge because they have no one to follow them. Having known, seen, heard, and understood this, I went forth in that way. I am pleased with this and I bear it.”</p>
<p>“I too am pleased with and bear what you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are pleased with and bear.</p>
<p>“The honorable Rāṣṭrapāla also said that beings of this world have no possessions because they must leave everyone. O Rāṣṭrapāla, I have sons, wives, slaves, workmen . . . and princes, who follow me when I go, stay when I stay, and guard me when I am sleeping. However, the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla said that beings of this world have no possessions because they must leave everyone. Thinking of what, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, did you say this?”</p>
<p>“Great King, I will ask you something in return. Please answer as best you can.</p>
<p>“O Great King, what do you think? When death, which is displeasing for many people, wanted by few people,  pleasing for few people, unpleasant for many people, and common to all beings in the world, has come to you, if you say, ‘O my sons, wives, slaves, workmen . . . princes, now follow me going from this world to another world,’ can they do so?”</p>
<p>“No, O Rāṣṭrapāla, they cannot. When death, which is displeasing for many people, wanted by few people, pleasing for few people, unpleasant for many people, and common to all beings in the world, has come to me, if I say, ‘O my sons, wives, slaves, workmen . . . princes, now follow me going from this world to another world,’ they cannot do so. I will go from this world to another world by myself.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, having thought on this, the Blessed One, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Awakened One, the one who knows and sees, said that beings of this world have no possessions because they must leave everyone. Having known, seen, heard, and understood this, I went forth in that way. I am pleased with this and I bear it.”</p>
<p>“I too am pleased with and bear what you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are pleased with and bear.</p>
<p>“The honorable Rāṣṭrapāla also said that beings of this world are never satisfied because they do not know contentment and are slaves to desire. O Rāṣṭrapāla, I am fully enjoying this whole country of Kuru, and I am fully enjoying many consorts, storehouses, and treasuries. However, the honorable Rāṣṭrapāla said that  beings of this world are never satisfied because they do not know contentment and are slaves to desire. Thinking of what, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, did you say this?”</p>
<p>“Great King, I will ask you something in return. Please answer as best you can.</p>
<p>“O Great King, what do you think? You are enjoying this whole country of Kuru fully, and you are enjoying many consorts, storehouses, and treasuries fully. If a trustworthy, honest, steadfast man who does not deceive others comes from the east and says, ‘Your Majesty, I came here from the east; there I saw countries that were rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. Your Majesty, it is appropriate for you to conquer, win, and subjugate these countries, leading such armies, such treasures, and such vehicles,’ would you conquer, win, and subjugate those countries, leading your armies? O Great King, what do you think? Would you desire those countries?”</p>
<p>“O Rāṣṭrapāla, if I knew that it was appropriate for me to conquer, win, and subjugate those countries, leading such armies, such treasures, and such vehicles, I would conquer and subjugate them, leading my armies. I would desire those countries.”</p>
<p>“O Great King, having thought on this, the Blessed One, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Awakened One, the one who knows and sees, said that beings of this world are never satisfied because they do not know contentment and are slaves to desire. Having known, seen, heard, and understood this, I went forth in that way.  I am pleased with this and I bear it.”</p>
<p>“I too am pleased with and bear what you, honorable Rāṣṭrapāla, are pleased with and bear.”</p>
<p>When the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla had had the aforementioned conversation, he, the arhat, the elder, also said:</p>
<p>“I see that, in many worlds, people possessing wealth</p>
<p>Have accumulated their wealth because of their attachment.</p>
<p>Having obtained wealth, they do not give it to others</p>
<p>But seek more objects of desire.</p>
<p>“Masters of people, having conquered and subdued</p>
<p>The earth as far as the seashore,</p>
<p>Are not content with this side of the sea</p>
<p>But are eager to seek another shore.</p>
<p>“Masters of people and many other people</p>
<p>Are not satisfied with what they have obtained.</p>
<p>Not knowing contentment,</p>
<p>They will die unliberated from desires.</p>
<p>“Life is not permanent. One’s lifespan is short.</p>
<p>Those oppressed by old age have no refuge.</p>
<p>Wealth does not follow a dying man,</p>
<p>Nor do his relatives, friends, or sons.</p>
<p>“His kinsmen, sisters, all his companions,</p>
<p>And those beloved to him come together.</p>
<p>Saying, ‘Alas, he has become a god,’</p>
<p>They cry with tears on their faces, tearing at their hair.</p>
<p>“They cover his body, carry it,</p>
<p>Make a fire, and cremate it.</p>
<p>His own actions lead this being.</p>
<p>His wealth is divided and obtained by others.</p>
<p>“He is born by himself at birth;</p>
<p>He dies by himself at death;</p>
<p>He experiences pains by himself while in this world.</p>
<p>People have no companions in their transmigration.</p>
<p>“The rich, the poor, the steadfast,</p>
<p>And infants are equally touched by birth and death.</p>
<p>The steadfast do not tremble.</p>
<p>Infants always tremble because they are infants.</p>
<p>“Foolish, ignorant ones, even having learned,</p>
<p>Create three kinds of actions</p>
<p>And go to other wombs, other worlds.</p>
<p>They are not liberated from anger and continual suffering.</p>
<p>“Knowledge is said to be the best of all kinds of wealth;</p>
<p>One who knows himself understands himself with knowledge.</p>
<p>Foolish ones create evil actions</p>
<p>Because of not knowing existence, nonexistence, and themselves.</p>
<p>“One who robs others of minor things</p>
<p>By some means—unlawfully, or by force—</p>
<p>Will, having created such evil actions, be dependent on transmigration,</p>
<p>And the actions will surely continue; he will not be liberated.</p>
<p>“Just as a thief, having stolen from a house and been caught,</p>
<p>Is defeated by his own actions as one who has done evil actions,</p>
<p>People, having committed evil deeds,</p>
<p>Are defeated by their actions in this world and the next.</p>
<p>“Just as fruits fall from trees,</p>
<p>Young, middle-aged, and elderly people will fall.</p>
<p>Various objects of desire are desirable and pleasant;</p>
<p>They control the mind with such qualities.</p>
<p>“Objects of desire bind and fasten people to this world.</p>
<p>If there are objects of desire, there will arise anger and fear.</p>
<p>When I saw this, O King, I went forth from this world.</p>
<p>The state of the śramaṇa is indestructible; it is supreme.”</p>
<p>King Kauravya rejoiced in and praised the words of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla. He bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, rose from his seat, and departed.</p>
<p>V. Hastināpura</p>
<p>The Blessed One then arrived in Hastināpura. When from a distance a brahmin saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, the brahmin went to the Blessed One and praised him in verse:</p>
<p>“Golden and pleasing to the eyes,</p>
<p>You are the source of pleasure possessed of all good qualities,</p>
<p>Tamer of people to be tamed, god of gods,</p>
<p>And one who has arrived at the far shore of the ocean of existence.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One smiled.  It naturally occurs that whenever the buddhas, the blessed ones, smile, . . . . The rays disappeared into the circle of hair between his eyebrows.  Then the venerable Ānanda made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said:</p>
<p>“A mass made brilliant by thousands of colors</p>
<p>. . . .”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Good, good, Ānanda! Ānanda, tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly awakened ones do not smile without cause, without condition. Ānanda, did you see the brahmin speak the verse and praise the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, O Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“By this root of merit he will never fall into the inferior modes of existence, but will be reborn among gods and humans for twenty eons, and he will become a self-awakened one named Stavārha in his last life, last birth, last body, last taking up of an identity.”</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that when this brahmin spoke a single verse and praised the Blessed One, the Blessed One predicted his awakening as a self-awakened one?”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks,” replied the Blessed One, “and inscribe it in your minds how, not only in the present but also in the past, he spoke a single verse and praised me, and how I gave him five excellent villages. I will tell you about it.</p>
<p>“A time long ago, monks, there was a king named Brahmadatta in the city of Vārāṇasī.  He ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  He was extremely fond of poets.</p>
<p>“There was a certain brahmin poet in Vārāṇasī whose wife once said to him, ‘O brahmin, since the cold season has come, go to the king and make some agreeable speech so that you can obtain a little defense against the cold.’</p>
<p>“So, he departed. At that time, the king was setting off on an elephant. The brahmin asked himself, ‘Should I praise the king or the excellent elephant?’ He thought, ‘Since this excellent elephant is desirable and pleasing for everyone in the world and especially so for the king, I will praise the excellent elephant for now.’ He then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Perfect in its form, with excellent features,</p>
<p>Just like the body of Airāvaṇa;</p>
<p>With its bodily form, fair in color and great in size,</p>
<p>This great king of elephants is commended for auspiciousness.’</p>
<p>“The king was pleased and spoke a verse in return:</p>
<p>“ ‘My great elephant is desirable and pleasing;</p>
<p>It holds people’s gaze and generates pleasure.</p>
<p>Since you have spoken a eulogy to it,</p>
<p>I will give you five excellent villages.’</p>
<p>“Monks, I myself was at that time, on that occasion, the excellent elephant; this brahmin was at that time, on that occasion, the brahmin. I then gave him five excellent villages because he had spoken a single verse and praised me. Now, too, I have predicted his awakening as a self-awakened one because he spoke a single verse and praised me.​​</p>
<p>VI. The Great City</p>
<p>Having arrived at a great city, . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail) . . . .</p>
<p>VII. Śrughnā</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in the country of Śrughnā, where there was a brahmin named Indra who was conceited about his good looks, youth, and learning, and boasted that there was no one equal to him.</p>
<p>In a certain place the Blessed One preached the Dharma, sitting on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The brahmin Indra, having heard that the śramaṇa Gautama had arrived in the country of Śrughnā, thought, “I have heard that the śramaṇa Gautama is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold.  I will go to see whether he is more handsome than me or not.”</p>
<p>He departed and when he saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, the brahmin thought, “Although the śramaṇa Gautama is more handsome than me, he is not taller than me.” He tried to see the crown of the Blessed One’s head. Unable to see it, he climbed up to a very high place, but it was in vain.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Indra, “Brahmin, you are making vain efforts. Even if you were to climb up to the summit of Mount Sumeru and try to see the crown of the Tathāgata’s head, these further efforts would be in vain, and you would still be unable to see it. Have you never heard that beings, including gods and asuras, do not see the crown of the head of the buddhas, the blessed ones? However, if you want to see the height of the Tathāgata’s body, there is a pillar made of gośīrṣacandana underneath the fire pit for oblations to the god of fire in your house; take it out and measure it. The height of the Tathāgata’s body that is generated from a father and a mother is the same as that.”</p>
<p>The brahmin Indra thought, “This is a wonder. I have never heard of that. I will go and see.”</p>
<p>He hurried home and dug under the fire pit for oblations to the god of fire. Everything was just as the Blessed One had explained. Filled with faith, he thought, “Since the śramaṇa Gautama is undoubtedly omniscient, I will go and serve him.” With faith, he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, face to face with the Blessed One, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation,  and then sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew the brahmin’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature . . . .  With the vajra of knowledge the brahmin leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, he said, “O Blessed One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin Indra rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “If the Blessed One allows it, I will prepare a festival of the pillar made of gośīrṣacandana.”</p>
<p>“Brahmin, I allow it,” said the Blessed One. “Go and prepare the festival.”</p>
<p>Thereupon he set up the pillar in a certain solitary place with great reverence and prepared the great festival. Other brahmins and householders tied kuśa grass, thinking, “May this festival become a basis for happiness (kuśala).” Since the brahmin Indra had prepared the festival, it was named “Indra’s Festival.”</p>
<p>VIII. Brahmin Village</p>
<p>A. A Fire Caused by an Old Man from the Śākya Clan</p>
<p>Once, when the Blessed One had displayed a great miracle in Śrāvastī and the non-Buddhist ascetics were frightened, the gods and humans were pleased, and good people were delighted. The non-Buddhist ascetics then ran away and settled in the borderlands, some of them settling in a place named Brahmin Village.</p>
<p>There the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived in Brahmin Village.  When the non-Buddhist ascetics heard that the śramaṇa Gautama had come, they hurried to the houses of the brahmins and householders and said, “May the Dharma be attained! May the Dharma be attained!”</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders asked, “O noble ones, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Since we have witnessed your prosperity, we will leave before we witness your decline.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones, what will be our decline?” they asked.</p>
<p>“Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama is coming with twelve hundred and fifty attendants and causing hail like razors. He will make those who have sons sonless.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones,” they replied, “it would not be good if you left at the very moment when you should stay and help us; this is unreasonable to us in every way!”</p>
<p>“We will stay if you promise to kill the śramaṇa Gautama,” they said.</p>
<p>“Please stay. We will kill him.”</p>
<p>They departed armed, holding sticks and bows in their hands and clenching their fists. Along the way, there was an old man from the Śākya clan. He saw them and asked, “Sirs, where are you going?”</p>
<p>They answered, “We are going to kill an enemy.”</p>
<p>“Who is your enemy?”</p>
<p>“It is the śramaṇa Gautama.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, if the Blessed One were your enemy, who else could be your friend? Sirs, go back.”</p>
<p>They would not go back, so he thought, “Since it is pointless to reason with these people, I should by all means drive them back.”</p>
<p>He entered a hamlet and set fire to it, burning it down entirely. Great cries and a clamor rose up. The brahmins and householders became frightened when they heard all that and said, “Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama is quite far away from us; there is another great disaster right here in this hamlet. Since the hamlet is burning, let us turn back to extinguish the fire.”</p>
<p>They tried to extinguish the fire,  but in vain. The Blessed One arrived and asked, “Vāsiṣṭhas, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, the hamlets are being burned down by fire. We are not able to extinguish it.”</p>
<p>“Shall I extinguish it?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, please extinguish it.”</p>
<p>As soon as the Blessed One uttered a word, the fire died by the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods. Filled with faith, the people asked, “O Blessed One, for what purpose have you come?”</p>
<p>“For the purpose of accepting none other than you as followers.”</p>
<p>At once the Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them and that caused them to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. . . . . With the vajra of knowledge they leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>B. The Former Life of the Old Man</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that this old man from the Śākya clan accumulated many nonmeritorious acts out of attachment to his relatives and burned down the hamlet?”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks,” replied the Blessed One, “and inscribe it in your minds how, not only in the present but also in the past, he accumulated many nonmeritorious acts out of attachment to his relatives and burned down a hamlet. I will tell you about it.</p>
<p>“In a time long ago, monks, there lived a troop of five hundred monkeys in a certain hamlet. They used to spoil the crops when they ripened. The people dwelling in the hamlet gathered and said to each other, ‘Sirs, the monkeys are damaging the crops. How should we deal with this?’</p>
<p>“Some people said, ‘The monkeys  should be killed.’</p>
<p>“ ‘How should we kill them?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Let’s cut down all the trees around the hamlet, leaving only one persimmon tree, and surround it with thorns. When the monkeys have climbed it to eat the fruit, there we should kill them.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon they cut down all the trees around the hamlet, leaving only one persimmon tree, and surrounded it with thorns. They set a lookout and instructed him, ‘You should let us know when the monkeys have gathered.’</p>
<p>“Sometime after that, the persimmon tree bloomed and its fruit became ripe. The monkeys said to their leader, ‘O Leader, the persimmons are ripe; let’s go eat them.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the leader, with five hundred attendants, climbed the persimmon tree and started to eat the persimmons. Then the lookout said to the people dwelling in the hamlet, ‘Sirs, all the monkeys have climbed the persimmon tree and are eating. Get on with your business; do what should be done.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the people dwelling in the hamlet hurried there, holding sticks and bows in their hands and clenching their fists, and started to cut down the persimmon tree. Being scared, the monkeys jumped to and fro on the branches, but the leader kept eating, unconcerned. The monkeys asked him, ‘O Leader, while we are experiencing intolerable pain and fear and are jumping to and fro, why are you unconcerned?’</p>
<p>“He spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘For those who have many things to do, there are also many things not to do.</p>
<p>Since there remains much of the tree,</p>
<p>Leave your worries behind and eat.’</p>
<p>“Meanwhile a son of the leader had been kept tied up in the hamlet. He was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. Then a good monkey came and  saw him plunged into grief and asked, ‘O my friend, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?’</p>
<p>“He answered, ‘Now all the people have gone to kill my family. How can I help being plunged into grief?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do you not drive them back?’</p>
<p>“ ‘How could I do that, tied up as I am?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will release you.’</p>
<p>“The good monkey then did release him. Thereupon he set fire to the hamlet, burning it down entirely. Great cries and a clamor rose up. The people became frightened when they heard all that and said, ‘Sirs, the monkeys are quite far away from us; there is another great disaster right here. Since the hamlet is burning, let’s turn back to extinguish the fire.’</p>
<p>“They ran to extinguish the fire, and the monkeys climbed down the persimmon tree and ran away.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the monkey’s son is this old man from the Śākya clan. He then burned the hamlet out of attachment to his relatives. Now, too, he has burned a hamlet out of attachment to his relatives.”</p>
<p>IX. The City of Kāla</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived at the city of Kāla. In the city of Kāla, . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail) . . . .</p>
<p>X. Rohitaka</p>
<p>A. Offerings of the Yakṣa Elephant Power</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived in Rohitaka and stayed near the residence of the yakṣa Elephant Power. At that time the yakṣa Elephant Power was away at a meeting of yakṣas. When the yakṣa Elephant Power heard that the Blessed One had arrived and was staying near his very residence in Rohitaka, he went to the Blessed One. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, . . . . When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Thereupon  the yakṣa Elephant Power rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One assent to stay in my residence today.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the yakṣa Elephant Power by remaining silent. Thereupon the yakṣa Elephant Power magically created five hundred monasteries and prepared five hundred cushions, pillows, and square blankets, along with five hundred hearths. He then said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the yakṣa Elephant Power by remaining silent. The yakṣa Elephant Power, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat and departed. He then made a request of a friend of his named Guṃjika, a yakṣa of the country of Kaśmīra: “Since I have invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha to a meal, please send me fruits of the northern region.” After sending a messenger to Guṃjika, he prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he sprinkled and swept the inside of the monastery, prepared seats, and set up a jeweled pitcher. When the monastery keeper struck the gong, the yakṣa Guṃjika filled baskets with grapes and had yakṣas bring them. They piled the grapes up in the middle of the monastery. The monks knew neither what these fruits were nor how to make them suitable to consume. They asked the Blessed One, and the Blessed One said, “Monks, these are fruits from forests in the northern region that are called grapes.  Make them suitable to consume through fire and distribute them.”</p>
<p>When the monks started to do so with each grape, it took them an extremely long time. The Blessed One instructed them, “Make them into two or three groups and have the groups touched by fire.”</p>
<p>The yakṣa Elephant Power then knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal . . . . He took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the yakṣa Elephant Power, and then rose from his seat.</p>
<p>Many grapes were left. The Blessed One said, “You should squeeze the grapes and distribute the juice.”</p>
<p>Some juice was still left. The Blessed One said, “Heat it and keep it. It will be the community’s drink to be consumed at night.”</p>
<p>B. Departure to the Northern Region</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One washed his feet outside the monastery and entered the monastery to go into seclusion. Then the Blessed One thought, “Since I was born in an age of short lifespans, I have come close to the time for nirvāṇa. But there are many things to do for the benefit of people to be trained. If I go to the northern region with the monk Ānanda, it will be difficult to benefit people to be trained. Now I will go with the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi.”</p>
<p>And so, outside the monastery, the Blessed One summoned the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi with two verses.</p>
<p>“May you be excellent, mindful ones.</p>
<p>Mindful ones are always excellent.</p>
<p>With the heart that has attained tranquility</p>
<p>Mindful ones lie in comfort.</p>
<p>“May you be excellent, mindful ones.</p>
<p>Mindful ones are always excellent.</p>
<p>Having abandoned both winning and being won by others,</p>
<p>Mindful ones lie in comfort.”</p>

<p>the Yakṣiṇī Named Kuntī,</p>
<p>Kharjūrikā and the Stūpa Made of Dirt.</p>
<p>The story of Apalāla is summarized.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, let us go to the northern region to convert the nāga Apalāla.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the Blessed One, along with the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, flew from there across the sky by means of his magical powers. When the Blessed One saw a green forest rising in the distance, he asked the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, do you see that green forest rising?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“That is Mount Uśīra. When a hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, it will be called Tamasā Forest, the best of the dwelling places that are suited to tranquility.”</p>
<p>C. Awakened Power in Heaped Up</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One went to Heaped Up. There was then a yakṣa of evil disposition named Awakened Power in Heaped Up.  Even though people living in Heaped Up pleased him, he occasionally harmed them. When the people living in Heaped Up heard that the Blessed One had arrived at Heaped Up and was staying in such-and-such a place, they went to the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and they then sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, . . . and delighted the people living in Heaped Up . . . the Blessed One remained silent. Thereupon the people living in Heaped Up rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, this yakṣa Awakened Power has for a long time been hostile toward us who are not hostile, adversarial toward us who are not adversarial, and injurious to us who have not been injurious. Alas may the Blessed One have compassion and convert the yakṣa Awakened Power.”</p>
<p>At that time the yakṣa Awakened Power himself was sitting in the assembly. The Blessed One then asked the yakṣa Awakened Power, “Awakened Power, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, I did.”</p>
<p>“Awakened Power, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Sugata, I did.”</p>
<p>“Quit this inferior, evil conduct.”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, I will.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One let the yakṣa Awakened Power seek refuge in him and adopt the rules of training.  The yakṣa then built a sitting place named Heaped Up. Devout brahmins and householders built a monastery provided with all the requisites, too. When the Blessed One departed, the yakṣa Awakened Power followed to serve him. The Blessed One stopped him and said, “Protect these people. I, too, will make my eyes rise up into the air and descend here by means of my magical power after I am completely emancipated.”</p>
<p>Other people built a stūpa in this place, too, and named it Heaped Up Stūpa.</p>
<p>D. Dharma Power in Retuka</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived in Retuka, converted a yakṣa named Dharma Power there. He also built a dwelling place named Retuka.</p>
<p>E. Great Cup in the Indus, Feet</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to the Indus. On the Indus there was a ferryman. He gained faith through a miracle performed by the Blessed One’s magical power. Then, faith having arisen in him, he was established in the truths. Because the Blessed One, having converted the yakṣa Great Cup, trod on him with his feet, the place was named Great Cup Stepped On with the Feet.</p>
<p>F. Having a Shaved Head and Water Jar</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, having gone to the hermitage of ṛṣis, there converted Having a Shaved Head and Water Jar, a ṛṣi. Devout brahmins and householders also built a sitting place named Water Jar.</p>
<p>G. Apalāla</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, let us go to the residence of the nāga king Apalāla.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Thereupon he and the Blessed One went to the residence of the nāga king Apalāla. When the nāga king Apalāla heard that the Blessed One had come to his residence he became so enraged, angry, furious, and displeased that he soared high into the sky and started to cause hail and dust to fall. When the Blessed One, knowing that the nāga was angry,  meditated on love, the hail and dust changed, falling as the powder of agaru and the powder of the tamāla leaf. Then the nāga started to cause weapons such as discuses, single-pointed vajras, lances, and short spears to fall. But they, too, changed, falling as divine utpala, padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka, and mandārava flowers. Apalāla then started to emit smoke with the fire of wrath. The Blessed One, too, emitted smoke through his magical power.</p>
<p>Thereupon the nāga, with his power, arrogance, and pride broken, entered his residence and sat down. The Blessed One thought, “By two causes are wicked nāgas converted: fright and anger. Therefore, I will frighten him.”</p>
<p>Having thought this, he ordered the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, frighten the nāga king Apalāla.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” replied the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi to the Blessed One, and he threw a vajra at a mountain peak. The mountain peak shattered and fell, flattening the residence of the nāga king Apalāla. Then Apalāla, frightened, terrified, and dejected, tried to run away. The Blessed One then meditated on the element of fire. Burning, thoroughly burning, thoroughly and entirely burning, everything in all directions blazed as a single flame. The nāga found fire wherever he went, except under the feet of the Blessed One, where it was calm and cool. Thereupon he went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he threw himself at the Blessed One’s feet and said, “O Blessed One, why do you harass me?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied, “O one naturally subject to old age, why do I harass you? You are harassing me. If I had not attained a number of good qualities like I have,  you would have killed me and only my name would have remained.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then touched the crown of the nāga’s head with his hand, which was marked with a chakra, swastika, and nandyāvarta; whose fingers were connected with a web; which had been generated by hundreds of merits; and which comforts those who are frightened, and said, “Sir, since you offered a meal to four great disciples who are like wish-fulfilling vases, you should have been born among the glorious Thirty-Three Gods. But, having made a misguided aspiration, you were born among animals. You have spent your life with the desire to beat and kill, depriving others of their lives and harming others’ lives. Where, then, will your next mode of existence, next birth, next existence after dying in this world be, but in hell?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, please tell me what I should do.”</p>
<p>“Sir, now seek refuge in me, accept the rules of training, and grant freedom from fear to the people living in the country of Magadha.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, from today onward, having sought refuge in the Blessed One and accepted the rules of training, I will grant freedom from fear to the people living in the country of Magadha.”</p>
<p>Then his wife, daughter, and son’s wife said, “We, too, will seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks and keep the rules of training.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One gave them refuge and the rules of training. Mountain, the nāga’s son, said, “O Blessed One, I, too, will seek refuge and keep the rules of training.”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One,” said Apalāla, “since we nāgas have many foes, please do not give the rules of training to Mountain, even though you bestow on him refuge; he will protect us.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One  gave him refuge.</p>
<p>Then the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, having seen Apalāla, his companions, family, and friends converted, danced with his mind pleased and said:</p>
<p>“Tongue trembling with rage, his many heads shaking, he caused a rain of weapons like discuses.</p>
<p>Faced by the humans in their own homes like high mountain peaks,</p>
<p>Beheld and avoided by many people who wearily gasp for breath,</p>
<p>He was converted by the Ṛṣi’s instructions.”</p>
<p>H. The Nāga Huluḍa</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, having converted Apalāla with his sixty thousand attendants, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One saw a green forest rising before them, he said to the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, do you see that green forest rising before us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“Vajrapāṇi, that is the country of Kaśmīra. When a hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, there will be a monk there named Madhyandina, who will be a co-residential pupil of the monk Ānanda. When he (Madhyandina) has converted the wicked nāga Huluḍa, he will devise a plan to make the teaching prevail all over the country of Kaśmīra, having received a place for seated meditation. The country of Kaśmīra will become the best of the dwelling places that are suited to my insight. The country of Kaśmīra consists of the city and sixty thousand towns, six thousand towns, and sixty-three towns.”</p>
<p>I. Bhraṣṭolā, Ṛṣi, Āpannaka</p>
<p>The Blessed One converted a ṛṣi and the yakṣa Āpannaka, along with his attendants, in the country of Bhraṣṭolā.</p>
<p>J. Kanthā</p>
<p>The Blessed One converted a yakṣiṇī, along with her attendants, in the country of Kanthā.</p>
<p>K. In Dhānyapura, Converting the Mother of Best Army</p>
<p>The Blessed One, having arrived at Dhānyapura, established in the truths the mother of the king Best Army there.</p>
<p>L. The Potter in Naitarī</p>
<p>The Blessed One arrived at Naitarī, where there was a certain potter. Excessively proud of his art, he was taking vessels off of the wheel after he had dried them.  The Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert him, dressed as a potter and began a conversation with him: “What vessels are you putting down from the wheel?”</p>
<p>“I put them down after having dried them,” he answered.</p>
<p>“I put mine down after having dried them, too.”</p>
<p>“You and I are equal.”</p>
<p>“Why am I only this? I put mine down after having fired them, too.”</p>
<p>“You are superior to me.”</p>
<p>“I not only fire them, but also change them into ones made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal.”</p>
<p>He was filled with faith. The Blessed One then removed his guise as a potter and assumed his own appearance. He established the potter, along with his attendants, in the truths.</p>
<p>XI. Śādvalā</p>
<p>A. The Great Yakṣa of Śādvalā</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Śādvalā. He let a great yakṣa with his attendants in Śādvalā seek refuge in him and established them in the rules of training.</p>
<p>B. Pālitakūṭa</p>
<p>In Pālitakūṭa, the Blessed One converted two nāgas, Gopālaka and Separating.</p>
<p>XII. Nandivardhana</p>
<p>A. Bhavadeva’s, Caṇḍālī’s Seven Sons’, and the Yakṣa Earth-Protector’s Conversion in Nandivardhana</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Nandivardhana, where he established the king, Bhavadeva, along with his attendants, the seven sons of Caṇḍālī, and the yakṣa Earth-Protector, in the truths.</p>
<p>B. Giving an Image to Nāgas, Aśvaka, and Punarvasuka</p>
<p>In a large lake, Aśvaka and Punarvasuka were born from the wombs of nāgas. After spending twelve years in the lake, they appeared on the water and said angrily, “Since the Blessed One did not preach the Dharma to us, we have fallen into this state; we were born from the wombs of nāgas. Therefore, let us destroy his teaching.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One thought, “Since the nāgas Aśvaka and Punarvasuka are of great dignity and magical power, it is possible that they will smash my teaching into pieces after I am completely emancipated.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then went to the two nāgas, Aśvaka and Punarvasuka. When he arrived, he said to the two, Aśvaka and Punarvasuka,  “Aśvaka and Punarvasuka, there is a teaching device of the Dharma called four phrases. I will teach it to you; you should know it.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, who will make us desire the true Dharma?”</p>
<p>They both entered the water again. They thought, “Even if the Blessed One teaches the Dharma to us, we will not understand it.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One left an image of himself at that place. Whenever the two, Aśvaka and Punarvasuka, saw it, they went back into the water, thinking, “The Blessed One still seems to be here.”</p>
<p>C. Converting Nāḍikā and Naḍadaryā</p>
<p>In that very place the Blessed One converted two yakṣiṇīs, Nāḍikā and Naḍadaryā.</p>
<p>D. In the City of Kuntī, the Yakṣiṇī Named Kuntī</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to the city of Kuntī. In the city of Kuntī, there was a wrathful, fierce, and violent yakṣiṇī named Kuntī. Whenever a son was born to a brahmin or a householder in the city of Kuntī, she ate the child.</p>
<p>When the brahmins and householders in the city of Kuntī heard that the Blessed One had arrived in the city of Kuntī and was staying at such-and-such a place, they met together, flocked together, swarmed together, left the city of Kuntī, and went to see the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, . . . the brahmins and householders in the city of Kuntī. When he had . . . delighted them . . . the Blessed One remained silent.</p>
<p>Then the brahmins and householders in the city of Kuntī rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One,  “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal tomorrow.” . . .  Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, they held golden pitchers and sat down before the Blessed One to ask a favor. They said, “The Blessed One has converted many wicked nāgas and wicked yakṣas. O Honored One, this yakṣiṇī named Kuntī has for a long time been hostile toward us who are not hostile, adversarial toward us who are not adversarial, and injurious to us who have not been injurious, and she snatches our children away whenever one is born. May the Blessed One have compassion and convert the yakṣiṇī Kuntī.”</p>
<p>At that time the yakṣiṇī Kuntī herself was sitting in the assembly. Then the Blessed One asked the yakṣiṇī Kuntī, “Kuntī, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, I did.”</p>
<p>“Kuntī, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Sugata, I did.”</p>
<p>“Quit this inferior, evil conduct.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, if they promise to have a monastery built for me, I will stop.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One asked the brahmins and householders in the city of Kuntī, “Brahmins and householders, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, we did.”</p>
<p>“What will you do?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, we will build it. O Sugata, we will build it.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One departed, having converted the yakṣiṇī Kuntī, along with her attendants.</p>
<p>E. Kharjūrikā and the Stūpa Made of Dirt</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Kharjūrikā, where little children were making a stūpa out of dirt. The Blessed One saw the little children making a stūpa out of dirt and he said to the yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, “Vajrapāṇi, do you see the little children making a stūpa out of dirt?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, I do.”</p>
<p>“Vajrapāṇi, when four hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, here will appear a king from the lineage of Kuṣāṇa named Kaniṣka. He will build a stūpa in this place. Its name will be Kaniṣka Stūpa, and it will perform acts of a buddha even though by then I will have been completely emancipated.”</p>
<p>After that, having converted seven million seven hundred thousand beings between Rohitaka and the nāga king Apalāla’s residence, the Blessed One returned to Rohitaka. He entered the monastery and went into seclusion.</p>
<p>The Blessed One arose from his seclusion in the evening and said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Ādirājya.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, the Blessed One once said, ‘Ānanda, let us go to convert the nāga king Apalāla in the northern region. There are five advantages of the northern region.’ Now the Blessed One has just said, ‘Ānanda, let us go to Ādirājya.’ What does this mean?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One answered, “Ānanda, I have gone to the northern region with Vajrapāṇi. I predicted Tamasā Forest, . . . predicted the stūpa made of dirt. Ānanda, the Tathāgata has converted seven million seven hundred thousand beings  between Rohitaka and the residence of the nāga king Apalāla. There are five disadvantages of the northern region: the land is uneven; it is full of logs and thorns; there are many stones, pebbles, and gravel; dogs bite; and women behave wickedly.”</p>

<p>Hungry Ghosts, and Velāma.</p>
<p>I. Ādirājya</p>
<p>Traveling through the country of Śūrasena, the Blessed One then went to Ādirājya. There the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this place King Mahāsammata, who was the first king, was anointed. Therefore, this place was named Ādirājya (first kingship).”</p>
<p>II. Bhadrāśva</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Bhadrāśva. There the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this place appeared King Mahāsammata’s good, precious horse. Therefore this place was named Bhadrāśva (good horse).”</p>
<p>III. Mathurā</p>
<p>A. The Prediction about Upagupta</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Mathurā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One went to Mathurā, where he saw a green forest rising in the distance. At the sight of it, he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, do you see the green forest rising?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“That is a mountain called Urumuṇḍa. When a hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, two brothers in Mathurā named Naṭa and Bhaṭa will build a monastery there.  Its name will therefore be Naṭabhaṭika, and it will become the best of the dwelling places that are suited to insight and tranquility.</p>
<p>“Ānanda, in this Mathurā there will be a son of a perfumer named Gupta. His son, Upagupta, will be a buddha without the marks. When a hundred years have passed after I am completely emancipated, he will perform the acts of a buddha, having gone forth in the teachings. The monk Ānanda’s co-residential pupil named Madhyandina will let Upagupta go forth. The last of the instructors will be Upagupta. There will be a cave that is eighteen cubits long, twelve cubits wide, and seven cubits high near that Naṭabhaṭika. Each of those who have been instructed by him to actualize the fruit of an arhat will throw a stick of four fingers’ breadth into the cave. When the cave has become full of the sticks of those arhats, Upagupta will be completely emancipated. After he has been completely emancipated, they will pile up the arhats’ sticks and cremate his body.”</p>
<p>B. The Former Life of Upagupta</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that the Blessed One has predicted the venerable Upagupta’s having compassion for many people in the future?”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks,” said the Blessed One, “and inscribe it in your minds how, not only in that time, but also previously, he acted for the benefit of many people. I will tell you about it.</p>
<p>“In a time long ago, monks, there lived self-awakened ones, ṛṣis, and monkeys on the three sides of this Mount Urumuṇḍa. On one side lived five hundred self-awakened ones, on the second five hundred ṛṣis, and on the third five hundred monkeys. Whenever a child of a monkey  was born, the leader of the monkeys used to kill it. Therefore, the female monkeys, out of sorrow for their children, began to discuss this among themselves: ‘Listen, ladies. Since every time a child is born to us, it is killed by this leader, we must devise a plan regarding this—when any one of us female monkeys has become pregnant, she should not tell the leader.’</p>
<p>“Later, when a female monkey became pregnant, they concealed her in a hidden place and fed her with roots and fruits. After the baby monkey was born, they also nourished and raised him in that hidden place. That monkey then grew up and banished the leader from his own troop. The leader began to wander around on Mount Urumuṇḍa. As he wandered he heard the voices of the self-awakened ones and approached them. When he felt comfortable living with them, he offered them roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, and toothpicks. They, too, gave him leftovers from their bowls. Whenever the self-awakened ones had finished their meal, they used to sit with their legs crossed. Observing their behavior, the monkey, too, sat with his legs crossed.</p>
<p>“Later, the self-awakened ones thought, ‘Since we have attained what is to be attained with our putrid bodies, we will enter the realm of peaceful emancipation.’ They displayed miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, and causing rain to fall and lightning to strike, and they were completely emancipated in the realm of emancipation without remainder.</p>
<p>“They therefore did not rise at their usual hour of rising. When he did not see them, the monkey became anxious. The monkey entered the cave and shook their robes. Then  a deity living in the cave thought, ‘If this monkey destroys the bodies of the self-awakened ones, that would not be appropriate.’ He shut the entrance with a large stone slab and stood there. The monkey felt sorrow and pain and lamentation, and so he departed and wandered on Mount Urumuṇḍa. Anxious, and missing the humans, he strained his ears to hear a human voice, and soon he heard the voices spoken by those ṛṣis. Just like a lost traveler, he hurried to them.</p>
<p>“Those ṛṣis were harming themselves with horrible ascetic practices: some were keeping their hands raised, some were standing on one foot, and some were tormenting themselves with fivefold heat. When the monkey felt comfortable living with them, he offered them roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, and toothpicks. They, too, gave him their leftovers. Disrupting their behavior, he taught them the behavior of the self-awakened ones: there he lowered the hands of those who were keeping their hands raised, snapped his fingers, and sat down before them with his legs crossed; he lowered the legs of those who were standing on one foot and sat down before them with his legs crossed; and he put out the fires of those who were tormenting themselves with fivefold heat, snapped his fingers, and sat down before them with his legs crossed. Then the ṛṣis said to their instructor, ‘Master, this monkey interrupts our ascetic practice,’ and they explained everything to him in detail.</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs,’ he replied, ‘these monkeys have good memories. Since he has certainly seen such behavior by some other ṛṣis, you should sit with your legs crossed, too.’</p>
<p>“When they sat with their legs crossed, their previous roots of merit  became manifest. They generated the thirty-seven aspects of awakening with knowledge, without a teacher or preceptor, and actualized the awakening of self-awakened ones. They directed the faith that had emerged from the Dharma to the monkey. Whenever they received fresh crops, fresh fruits, or seasonal foods as alms from people, they gave him some of the food first and after that enjoyed the rest of the food for themselves.</p>
<p>“Later, the monkey died. The self-awakened ones gathered fragrant wood from various areas and directions, heaped up all the fragrant wood, and cremated his body.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That monkey who lived with the self-awakened ones was indeed this Upagupta. At that time, he acted for the benefit of many people. And now, too, I have predicted his benefiting and having compassion for many people.”</p>
<p>C. The Brahmin Nīlabhūti</p>
<p>Thereupon The Blessed One, traveling in Śūrasena, went to Mathurā. Some brahmins in Mathurā heard that the śramaṇa Gautama had arrived in Mathurā and that, with the strong wish to purify the four castes, he explained, designated, defined, analyzed, expounded, clarified, taught, and perfectly taught. They thought, “If he enters Mathurā, he will be an obstacle to us gaining profit and honors. Since it is known that he is concerned about disrespectful acts, if someone performs disrespectful acts toward him, he will not stay in Mathurā. It would not be surprising if someone from a lowly family performed disrespectful acts toward him, but it would be more effective if some great person did so. Is there any great person among us?”</p>
<p>At that time there was a brahmin in Mathurā  named Nīlabhūti, who had mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas, who was able to present his own words clearly and defeat others’ criticisms, and whose words followed the truth. Then the brahmins in Mathurā met together, flocked together, went to Nīlabhūti, and said, “Master, it has been heard that the śramaṇa Gautama has come here and that, with the strong wish to purify the four castes, he . . . perfectly teaches. Since it is known that he is concerned about disrespectful acts, if someone performs disrespectful acts toward him, he will not stay in Mathurā. It would not be surprising if someone from a lowly family performed disrespectful acts toward him, but it would be more effective if some great person did so. Who else but you is the great person among us? Please revile him with disrespectful words of blame.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” said Nīlabhūti, “this tongue of mine follows the truth. If he deserves revilement, I will revile him. But if he deserves praise, I will praise him.”</p>
<p>After that, the brahmin Nīlabhūti, attended by the elder brahmins living in Mathurā, went to the Blessed One. The brahmin Nīlabhūti saw from a distance the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, sitting tranquilly under a tree. Upon seeing him, the brahmin opened his eyes wide with astonishment and began to praise the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Having duly concentrated</p>
<p>Body, speech, and mind along with the other faculties,</p>
<p>I will describe a mere fragment of the good qualities belonging to you,</p>
<p>Who have become good quality itself, the ocean of good qualities.</p>
<p>“You are the best, the most excellent, of those who speak,</p>
<p>Free from fault, with your faculties well settled;</p>
<p>All the opposing teachers contending with you</p>
<p>Cannot agitate you, who comprehend the highest truth.</p>
<p>“Your conduct is perfect</p>
<p>And your vow is well perfected and complete.</p>
<p>And, O Powerful One, your meditation’s inexhaustibility is just like</p>
<p>That of Nārāyaṇa and the king of mountains.</p>
<p>“O bull among men, you possess neither anguish,</p>
<p>Dejection, fear, nor fatigue.</p>
<p>Possessing no impatience with beings,</p>
<p>You are not attached to them, nor do you quarrel with anyone.</p>
<p>“There is no apprehension, and yet you experience no excessive discouragement.</p>
<p>There is no pain, and yet you have no delight.</p>
<p>Just like Mount Meru, the king of mountains,</p>
<p>Your mind is always good.</p>
<p>“O best of munis, in every domain</p>
<p>Your knowledge is extensive and free from obstacles,</p>
<p>And it engages various objects,</p>
<p>Unhindered, unwaning, inexhaustible.</p>
<p>“O Muni, for you there is no doubt,</p>
<p>Hesitancy, or uncertainty about anything;</p>
<p>Comprehending with knowledge</p>
<p>The greater and lesser capacities of beings, you know everything.</p>
<p>“You are pleasant to behold, good to behold;</p>
<p>Since you are good to behold, wise men are pleased to behold you.</p>
<p>Since what is pleasant and what is unpleasant are the same to you,</p>
<p>You always behave in a pleasant manner.</p>
<p>“You possess a sweet eloquence,</p>
<p>Speak with a smile with mindfulness, without fear.</p>
<p>Since you articulate what wise men love,</p>
<p>Your fame has spread throughout the three realms.</p>
<p>“Many humans, gods, asuras, yakṣas,</p>
<p>Rākṣasas, and wise men in this world</p>
<p>Come to the Muni again and again,</p>
<p>And ask you questions again and again, but you do not become angry.</p>
<p>“Since you please them with sweet words,</p>
<p>Humans, gods, asuras, yakṣas,</p>
<p>And rākṣasas who have become free from hesitancy, O Great Muni,</p>
<p>Pay homage at your feet and return.</p>
<p>“Your standing, sitting, coming, going,</p>
<p>Lying, being silent, speaking,</p>
<p>And holding your bowl and your robe—</p>
<p>O Gautama, everything of yours is beautiful.</p>
<p>“Since you experience neither obstacles nor haste and are even,</p>
<p>Your words possess the good qualities of sweetness.</p>
<p>Since you, the best of humans, speak at the appropriate time,</p>
<p>Your words are free from redundancy.</p>
<p>“You are renowned as one who possesses power in the world,</p>
<p>Who knows humans, bull among men, lord;</p>
<p>Toward this entire world including its gods</p>
<p>You are not haughty, nor do you despise anyone.</p>
<p>“With friends and enemies,</p>
<p>Obedient ones and disobedient ones,</p>
<p>Wavering ones and ones who are naturally unwavering,</p>
<p>You are never surprised.</p>
<p>“Having observed the agitated beings,</p>
<p>Who lament, speak miserably,</p>
<p>Slobber, and utter weary sounds;</p>
<p>Who are tormented, pained,</p>
<p>“Afflicted by fear and sorrow,</p>
<p>And oppressed by hundreds of kinds of suffering;</p>
<p>Who have lacked protection and happiness for a long time</p>
<p>And have fallen into desire for existence, and who are covered with darkness,</p>
<p>“With various kinds of your power,</p>
<p>Having a muni’s great compassion as a muni,</p>
<p>O best of the Śākyans, you exert yourself</p>
<p>To liberate those who are so distressed.</p>
<p>“The suffering of existence along with its cause,</p>
<p>The cessation of the suffering of existence,</p>
<p>And this incomparable path, which leads to</p>
<p>The cessation of the suffering of existence, are taught by you.</p>
<p>“O great leader with great vigor,</p>
<p>The best of the most excellent speakers,</p>
<p>None is equal to you in the three realms;</p>
<p>None surpasses you anywhere.</p>
<p>“You have neither wrath nor sycophancy;</p>
<p>O Muni, you have no difficulty.</p>
<p>O one who made an excellent vow, you have neither</p>
<p>Compliance, opposition, nor dispute. You never have any of these.</p>
<p>“O Muni, having left behind what is agreeable and what is disagreeable,</p>
<p>Happiness and suffering, and what is even and what is uneven,</p>
<p>You bear satisfaction and dissatisfaction,</p>
<p>And, being well restrained, conduct yourself with tranquility.</p>
<p>“Since, experiencing neither slander nor harm,</p>
<p>You do not become haughty by praise,</p>
<p>Fame and infamy are the same to you.</p>
<p>“Just as a tusked elephant is released for battle</p>
<p>And bears arrows fiercely shot,</p>
<p>You bear evil words—harsh words</p>
<p>Spoken by evil people.</p>
<p>“O Ṛṣi who speaks gently, you are tolerant of words;</p>
<p>There is no word you do not bear, even if very ill-spoken.</p>
<p>Whether slanderously or virtuously spoken of,</p>
<p>The Muni abides in sameness.</p>
<p>“The one worthy of worship is always worshiped by humans, gods,</p>
<p>Asuras, yakṣas, rākṣasas,</p>
<p>And great ṛṣis.</p>
<p>Your mind is steady and does not become otherwise.</p>
<p>“Since you do not feel conceit such as ‘I am superior to this one,’</p>
<p>‘I am inferior to this one,’</p>
<p>Or ‘I am equal to this one,’</p>
<p>You do not have the three kinds of pride.</p>
<p>“Steady, looking upon a lump of dirt and gold equally,</p>
<p>Looking upon lapis lazuli and pebbles and gravel equally,</p>
<p>O Great Muni, you behave as if these beings,</p>
<p>Including gods, are the same as grass or trees.</p>
<p>“Even if the moonlight and the sunlight come together,</p>
<p>And cold and hot winds arise,</p>
<p>You bear it just like the lord of mountains;</p>
<p>With a steady mind, you receive no harm.</p>
<p>“Having examined various kinds of bedding, drink, food,</p>
<p>And upper and lower garments</p>
<p>As unpolluted, O Muni,</p>
<p>You enjoy them.</p>
<p>“You do not lament, ‘I have no protector’;</p>
<p>Being unbound, speaking well, not seizing anything as your own,</p>
<p>You are free from various injuries.</p>
<p>“Obtaining profit, you are not delighted;</p>
<p>Not obtaining it, you are not discouraged.</p>
<p>Enduring disrespect, here</p>
<p>You are not attached to respect.</p>
<p>“The excellent blood-red sandalwood</p>
<p>That grows on the side of the mountain where gods dwell,</p>
<p>And sharp arrows and swords,</p>
<p>Never change your mind.</p>
<p>“You engage neither in meaningless talk</p>
<p>Nor in talk employed by wicked people—</p>
<p>Neither talk of profit, worldly talk,</p>
<p>Nor talk undesirable for great people—</p>
<p>“But you utter the words that generate seclusion and happiness,</p>
<p>The talk in which you proclaim only tranquility,</p>
<p>The talk that surpasses the gods’,</p>
<p>And the talk through which you remove sin.</p>
<p>“O Great Muni, for the sake of the world,</p>
<p>You speak words that are</p>
<p>Sweet, reasoned, eloquent,</p>
<p>Substantial, and definitive.</p>
<p>“Those who are foolish, who have wrong views,</p>
<p>Who are liars, who are connected to pleasure,</p>
<p>Who speak slanderous, harsh, or deceitful words—</p>
<p>O Blessed One, you never associate with them.</p>
<p>“Those who are straightforward, who do not deceive,</p>
<p>Who are pleased with truth, who have trained their faculties,</p>
<p>Who always act after full consideration—</p>
<p>O Blessed One, with these you associate.</p>
<p>“O one who knows the Dharma, means, and individuals,</p>
<p>O one who possesses the six kinds of supernormal knowledge, I always bow to you.</p>
<p>O Muni, skillful one, one who knows the greater and lesser capacities of beings</p>
<p>And good and bad conduct, I bow my head to you.</p>
<p>“Having observed the immense ocean of your good qualities,</p>
<p>I have described merely a fraction of your good qualities;</p>
<p>O noble one, the far shore of the ocean of your good qualities</p>
<p>Cannot be known by anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>When Nīlabhūti had praised the Blessed One with five hundred verses of praise, including those just recounted, and thus was filled with faith, the Blessed One preached the Dharma for him, so that he saw the truths, sitting on that very seat. After that, the brahmin Nīlabhūti, having praised the Blessed One, departed. When he was walking along the road, the brahmins in Mathurā scolded him: “Sir, we asked you to perform disrespectful acts toward the śramaṇa Gautama. Are you now coming back, having praised him?”</p>
<p>“Sirs, did I not say before, ‘My tongue follows the truth. If he deserves to be reviled, I will revile him. But if he deserves praise, I will praise him’? Since the śramaṇa Gautama deserves praise, I praised him.”</p>
<p>D. The Obstruction of the Buddha’s Way by a Goddess</p>
<p>The Blessed One dressed early one morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Mathurā for alms. At that time, it was the day of the star festival in Mathurā. A goddess living in Mathurā thought, “If the śramaṇa Gautama comes to Mathurā, he will interrupt my star festival.” She then stood naked before the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “O goddess, a woman does not look beautiful even if she is covered with clothes, let alone naked.”</p>
<p>Then the goddess was ashamed, and she left to one side of the road. After that, the Blessed One himself left the road and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Having sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, there are five disadvantages of Mathurā: the land is uneven;  it is full of logs and thorns; there are many stones, pebbles, and gravel there; people eat in the evening; and there are many women there.”</p>
<p>E. The Yakṣa Gardabha</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, not going farther down the road, went to the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha near Mathurā. When he arrived, he entered the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha and sat under a tree to pass the day there.</p>
<p>At that time the yakṣa Gardabha used to walk around in the form of an ass (gardabha). When boys or girls wanted to ride on him, he would let them ride on his back, pleasing them in that way, and then go to a dense forest and eat them. Therefore he was named “the yakṣa Gardabha.”</p>
<p>When the devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā heard that the Blessed One had come for alms, but, waylaid by a goddess, had not entered Mathurā but had gone to the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha, they cooked and prepared a pure and fine meal in pots, loaded the food on a carriage, and went to the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed . . . the devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā. After he had . . . delighted them . . . the Blessed One remained silent. Then the devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “O Honored One, we have brought here a carriage full of pure and fine food for the Blessed One. May the Blessed One have compassion for us  and accept this food.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and gather all the monks living near the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha in the assembly room. I will let them have the almsfood.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Having gathered all the monks living near the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha in the assembly room, he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, all the monks living near the residence of the yakṣa Gardabha are gathered in the assembly room. May the Blessed One know it is the right time.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One went to the assembly room and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. The devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā then knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, . . . knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, they sat before the Blessed One in order to ask a favor. They said, “O Honored One, the Blessed One has converted the wicked nāgas So-and-so and the wicked yakṣas So-and-so. O Honored One, this yakṣa Gardabha has for a long time been hostile toward us who are not hostile, adversarial toward us who are not adversarial, and injurious to us who have not been injurious,  and he snatches our children away whenever one is born. May the Blessed One have compassion and convert the yakṣa Gardabha.”</p>
<p>At that time the yakṣa Gardabha himself was sitting in the assembly. The Blessed One asked the yakṣa Gardabha, “Gardabha, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, I did.”</p>
<p>“Gardabha, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Sugata, I did.”</p>
<p>“Quit that inferior, evil conduct.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, if they promise to have a monastery for the community of monks of the four directions built for my sake, I will stop.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One asked the devout brahmins and householders in Mathurā, “Brahmins and householders, did you hear this?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, we did. We will build it.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One converted the yakṣa Gardabha, along with his five hundred attendants. The devout brahmins and householders built five hundred monasteries for his sake. In the same way, the Blessed One converted the yakṣa Śara, the yakṣa Vana, and the yakṣiṇī Ālikāvendāmaghā.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One entered Mathurā using his magical power. Once there, he converted the yakṣiṇī Timisikā, along with her five hundred attendants, and five hundred monasteries were built for her sake. After that, the Blessed One converted twenty-five hundred yakṣas inside and outside Mathurā, and the devout brahmins and householders built twenty-five hundred monasteries for their sake.</p>
<p>IV. Otalā Park</p>
<p>A. The Visit of the Brahmin Otalāyana</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One went to Otalā and stayed in Otalā Forest near Otalā.</p>
<p>There lived a very wealthy brahmin named Otalāyana, who was rich and had great wealth and many possessions . . . .</p>
<p>The Blessed One  dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Otalā for alms. In a certain place, five hundred peasants were plowing a field in their hempen lower garments, their heads covered with dust. The peasants saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, . . . and beautiful . . . with light . . . . The Blessed One preached the Dharma for them . . . and they became objects of veneration, respect, and praise.</p>
<p>Then the thousand oxen broke their yokes and the ropes around their horns and went themselves to the Blessed One. When they arrived, they sat down, surrounding the Blessed One. When the Blessed One had preached the Dharma that consists of three phrases for them, they were reborn among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings. . . . Having seen the truths, they left for their own residences.</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did these five hundred peasants and these oxen create that matured to cause them to be born as peasants in poor families and to become oxen?”</p>
<p>“Monks, the actions were performed and accumulated by them . . . . These people went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. They there spent their time lazily; that karma matured to cause them to become peasants. These oxen, too, went forth there, and they disregarded the minor rules of training; that karma matured to cause them to be reborn among animals. Their karma of going forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa matured to cause them to see the truths in my presence. Therefore, monks,  the maturation of entirely negative actions is . . . . ”</p>
<p>The very wealthy brahmin Otalāyana heard the following: “A śramaṇa, a son of the Śākyans from the Śākyan clan, one who went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, was awakened to complete and supreme awakening, and he has arrived at Otalā, having traveled in Śūrasena, and is staying in Otalā Forest. Sirs, the great virtue, fame, renown, and praise of that śramaṇa Gautama are known in all directions. Thus, that Blessed One is a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. Having in this life, by his own supernormal knowledge, actualized and accomplished awakening, he announced to the world with its gods, Māra, Brahmā, people such as śramaṇas and brahmins, and beings such as gods and humans, ‘My defilements have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ He teaches only the Dharma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good at the end, excellent in meaning, excellent in wording, distinct, complete, pure, and immaculate.”</p>
<p>Thinking that it would be good to see, approach, and serve such a śramaṇa or brahmin, he left Otalā,  riding an entirely white chariot pulled by mares, surrounded and followed by young brahmins, carrying a golden water jar with a handle,  and went to see and serve the Blessed One. Having gone as far as he could go by vehicle, he alighted from the vehicle and entered the park on foot. The very wealthy brahmin Otalāyana went to the Blessed One, and when he arrived, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side.  Having sat down to one side, the very wealthy brahmin Otalāyana said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, the five faculties have separate fields and separate domains, and each of them experiences its own field and domain but does not experience other fields and domains: namely, the faculty of the eyes, the faculty of the ears, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, and the faculty of the body. What experiences the fields and domains of these? What is the basis of these?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the five faculties do have separate fields and separate domains: namely, the faculty of the eyes, the faculty of the ears, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, and the faculty of the body. It is mind that experiences the fields and domains of these. The basis of these is mind.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of mind?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the basis of mind is mindfulness.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of mindfulness?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the basis of mindfulness is the four applications of mindfulness.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of the four applications of mindfulness?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the basis of the four applications of mindfulness is the seven limbs of awakening.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of the seven limbs of awakening?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the basis of the seven limbs of awakening is knowledge and liberation.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of knowledge and  liberation?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, the basis of knowledge and liberation is nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>“O Gautama, what is the basis of nirvāṇa?”</p>
<p>“O brahmin, this is great nonsense, this is great nonsense. The end of such questions will never be reached. In my presence, for the purpose of destroying suffering and bringing suffering to an end, the pure life is led, which approaches nirvāṇa and has nirvāṇa as its end.”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin Otalāyana thought, “What harm should I do to him?” He had heard before that if one invites the śramaṇa Gautama with the community of disciples, offers them a meal, and forms an aspiration, he will attain all that he wants and seeks. Then the brahmin Otalāyana rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” . . . Knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat, sat before the Blessed One, and made this aspiration: “May all these śramaṇas, sons of the Śākyans, whom I have offered a meal, become my oxen.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing the brahmin Otalāyana’s mind with his own mind, said to the brahmin Otalāyana, “O brahmin, you have conceived an undesirable thought; it will not be accomplished. Since all these monks have destroyed their future existences, you should conceive another thought.” Having assigned the rewards of the offerings, the Blessed One departed.</p>
<p>After that,  the Blessed One went to the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Having sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, since the brahmin Otalāyana conceived an evil thought and made an inappropriate aspiration, you should recite ‘Verses of the Ṛṣi’ after having had a meal; then such an inappropriate aspiration will not be accomplished.”</p>
<p>B. Kacaṅgalā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, after the night had passed, entered Otalā for alms with the venerable Ānanda, the attending śramaṇa. There lived an old female slave named Kacaṅgalā in Otalā. When she went to the well, taking a pitcher with her, the Blessed One went to that place, too. The Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert her, said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and say to that old woman, ‘The Blessed One is thirsty; please give me some water.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he went to Kacaṅgalā, the old woman. When he reached her, he said, “Kacaṅgalā, the Blessed One is thirsty; please give me some water.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, I will bring it to him myself,” she replied.</p>
<p>Then Kacaṅgalā filled the pitcher with water and hurried to the Blessed One. As soon as Kacaṅgalā saw the Blessed One, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, she conceived the love one has for a son. Raising her hands, she tried to embrace the Blessed One and cried, “Son! Son!” The monks prevented her.</p>
<p>The Blessed One told them,  “Monks, you should not hinder this old woman. Why?</p>
<p>“Since for five hundred lives she has always</p>
<p>Been my mother,</p>
<p>If you prevent her</p>
<p>From touching my body,</p>
<p>Immediately she will vomit</p>
<p>Hot blood from her mouth.</p>
<p>“Seeing her missing her son,</p>
<p>I reflect on gratitude</p>
<p>And, out of compassion and love,</p>
<p>Allow her to touch my body.”</p>
<p>Because the Blessed One allowed her to embrace him around the neck, her attachment to her son calmed down, and she sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew her thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her and that caused her to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. When she had heard the Dharma, Kacaṅgalā leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the four truths of the noble ones, she spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for me is what has never been done for me by my father, my mother, . . . . With the vajra of knowledge I have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that have been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.” And then she spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“What should be done by the best son</p>
<p>Who benefits his mother in return,</p>
<p>Having the wish for her liberation,</p>
<p>This you have done for me today.</p>
<p>“You have saved me from inferior modes of existence</p>
<p>And placed me in heaven and liberation;</p>
<p>With great effort, you have done</p>
<p>What is difficult to do.”</p>
<p>Having spoken thus, she bowed low until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>Later, Kacaṅgalā went to the Blessed One, having gained permission from her master. When she arrived,  she bowed low until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then she sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, she said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a nun in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One entrusted her to Mahāprajāpatī. Thereupon Mahāprajāpatī let her go forth, ordained her, and instructed her.  Exerting herself, endeavoring, and striving, she abandoned all the defilements, actualized the state of an arhantī, and became an arhantī. She was free from desire for the three realms . . . became an object of . . . praise.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had briefly preached to the nuns a sermon and entered the monastery to go into seclusion, Kacaṅgalā fully expanded on the teaching. After that, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, among my nuns, female disciples who analyze the sūtras, this nun Kacaṅgalā is the best.”</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did Kacaṅgalā create that matured to cause her to go forth after she became old? What karma did she create that matured to cause her to be a poor female slave, cause the Blessed One not to enter into her womb for his last birth, and cause her to realize the state of an arhantī after going forth, and to be praised by the Blessed One as the best of those who analyze the sūtras?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the nun Kacaṅgalā herself, accruing a heap of karma. . . . .</p>
<p>“. . .</p>
<p>. . . bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, when I once was engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattva, she was my mother. She stopped me when I wished to go forth; that karma matured to cause her to go forth after she became old. When I gave a donation, she interfered; because of this, she became poor. She did not perform great actions that would generate the great power of merit as Mahāmāyā did; therefore, I did not enter her womb for my last birth. Having gone forth in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, she uttered the words ‘slave woman’ against nuns, both those who were practitioners undergoing training and those who were practitioners having completed training; therefore, she became a female slave. There, through recitation and repetition, she became familiar with the aggregates, spheres, and elements, dependent origination, and what is proper and what is improper; therefore, she abandoned all the defilements and actualized the state of an arhantī, having gone forth in my teaching. Since her preceptress who had ordained her had been praised by the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa as the best of those who analyzed the sūtras, this woman made this aspiration at the time of her death: ‘While I have led the pure life throughout my life in the presence of the Blessed One, the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, the supreme one worthy of veneration, I have not yet attained any good qualities. By this root of merit, may I go forth in the teachings of the Buddha Śākyamuni whom the young brahmin named Uttara was predicted to become by the Blessed One, the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa: “Young brahmin, you will become a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one called Śākyamuni when people’s lifespans are a hundred years long.” As this preceptress of mine was praised  as the best of those who analyze the sūtras, may I too be praised as the best of those who analyze the sūtras by the Blessed One Śākyamuni.’ Because of this wish, she was praised by me as the best of those who analyze the sūtras.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.” Thus spoke the Blessed One.</p>
<p>V. Vairambhya</p>
<p>A. The Brahmin in a Park</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to the country of Vairambhya.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. After that, the Blessed One departed. At that time, in a certain park a brahmin was beginning to sprinkle the park with water, having drawn water from a well. When the brahmin saw the Blessed One from a distance, he thought, “If the śramaṇa Gautama enters the park, the park and the water will be polluted,” and he shut the gate, hid the rope and pitcher, and sat down.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One entered the park using his magical power. Pāñcika, the great general of yakṣas, seized the well and submerged the entire park in water. Then the brahmin understood, “This śramaṇa Gautama is of great magical power and dignity.” Filled with faith, he said, “O honorable Gautama, come. Here is a rope; here is a pitcher. Please accept water in comfort.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If there is water everywhere,</p>
<p>What need is there for a well?</p>
<p>Having cut off the root of desire here,</p>
<p>Who would look for something more to do?”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya . . . .” The Blessed One ordained him by saying “Come, monk,” . . . .</p>
<p>Because the Tathāgata said, “Come,”</p>
<p>His hair fell out and he was clad in his outer robe,</p>
<p>His faculties were at once calmed,</p>
<p>And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>He, exerting himself, endeavoring, and striving, abandoned all the defilements, actualized the state of an arhat, and became an arhat. He was free from desire for the three realms . . . became an object of . . . praise . . . .</p>
<p>B. King Agnidatta’s Offer</p>
<p>Afterward the Blessed One, traveling in Śūrasena, arrived at Vairambhya and stayed under the neem tree of Naḍera near Vairambhya.</p>
<p>At that time, a brahmin king named Agnidatta ruled over Vairambhya, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  When Agnidatta, the brahmin king, heard that the śramaṇa Gautama, having traveled through Śūrasena, had arrived in Vairambhya and was staying under the neem tree of Naḍera near Vairambhya, he thought, “The śramaṇa Gautama is treated with honor, looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man by all the neighboring kings. If I do not treat him with honor, the neighboring kings will reproach me: ‘Sirs, what a fool Agnidatta, the brahmin king, is! While the śramaṇa Gautama has come and is staying in his town, his country, the king does not treat him with honor.’ Now I will offer the śramaṇa Gautama  together with the community of disciples all the requisites.” Having thought this, he went to the Blessed One, displaying great royal treasures and great royal power. When he arrived, he made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation with the Blessed One, and then sat down to one side. When Agnidatta, the brahmin king, had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, . . . . When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the honorable Gautama with the community of disciples assent to my offer of the requisites for three months: namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.” The Blessed One assented to Agnidatta, the brahmin king, by remaining silent. Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One, and he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>He went to his own residence and ordered his ministers, “Every day cook eighteen kinds of food, various kinds of bean paste, tasty sauce, and much rice for five hundred people.” Then he proclaimed with the ringing of bells: “None but I should offer meals to the śramaṇa Gautama for three months. Anyone who offers him a meal will be killed as punishment.”</p>
<p>After issuing this proclamation with the ringing of bells, he dreamt while sleeping in the night that the entire city of Vairambhya was encircled with his own intestine. Having dreamt this,  he sprang to his feet from his large bed, frightened and dejected, with the hairs in every pore of his body standing on end. He sat plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, asking himself, “Oh, is there any chance I will lose my throne or be in danger of death because of this?” After the night had passed, he said to the brahmin who was the chief priest, “Sir, I have dreamt such-and-such. What should I do about this?”</p>
<p>The brahmin chief priest thought, “The king has had an auspicious dream. Since, if I speak well of it, he will increase his faith in the śramaṇa Gautama all the more, I will now speak ill of it.” He said, “Your Majesty, this is an inauspicious dream.”</p>
<p>“Sir, what will be the result of this?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you will certainly lose your throne or be in danger of death.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” thought the king, “I am losing my throne or am in danger of death!” With this thought, he asked the brahmin, the chief priest, “Is there any good way to avoid losing my throne and being in danger of death?”</p>
<p>“If Your Majesty will stay in a concealed location for three months,” said the brahmin, “then Your Majesty will neither lose his throne nor be in danger of death.”</p>
<p>Agnidatta, the brahmin king, thought, “If so, that is easy to do. I will make a proclamation with the ringing of bells.” He proclaimed throughout the country with the ringing of bells: “No one should come to see me for three months. Anyone who comes to me will be killed as punishment.” After issuing this proclamation with the ringing of bells, he did stay in a concealed location for three months.</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda rose at dawn and went to the residence of Agnidatta, the brahmin king. There he saw the laborers of Agnidatta, the brahmin king, sitting idle. When he saw this, he asked them, “Sirs,  why are you sitting idle?”</p>
<p>“O noble one, what should we be doing?”</p>
<p>“Has Agnidatta, the brahmin king, not offered all the requisites for three months to the community of monks headed by the Buddha? You are sitting idle, not preparing a meal or arranging seats. Has the meal for the community of monks headed by the Buddha been cancelled?”</p>
<p>“O noble one Ānanda,” they replied, “although His Majesty has ordered us to prepare good food abundantly for five hundred people, he has not indicated for whom it is.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, now ask His Majesty about this.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, His Majesty has proclaimed with the ringing of bells: ‘No one should come to see me for three months. Anyone who comes to me will be killed as punishment.’ Do any of us have two heads? We will not ask him.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he reported this to the Blessed One in detail. The Blessed One then issued this instruction to the venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, go and take your outer robe. Call out, with an attending śramaṇa, in wide streets, in markets, at crossroads, and at three-forked roads in Vairambhya, ‘Sirs, whoever among you can offer meals for three months to the community of monks headed by the Buddha should do so.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. He took his outer robe and called out, with an attending śramaṇa, in wide streets, in markets, at crossroads, and at three-forked roads in Vairambhya, “Sirs, whoever among you can offer meals for three months to the community of monks headed by the Buddha should do so.”</p>
<p>The brahmins and  householders in Vairambhya said, “O noble one Ānanda, although each of us could offer meals for three months to the Blessed One together with the community of disciples, this evil king has proclaimed with the ringing of bells: ‘None but I should offer meals to the śramaṇa Gautama for three months. Anyone who offers a meal will be killed as punishment.’ ”</p>
<p>At that time, a caravan leader with five hundred loaded horses arrived at Vairambhya from the northern region. He thought, “If I depart soon, the hooves of the horses will be worn out, and they will become lame and unfit for sale. I will stay here.”</p>
<p>He stayed there and prepared two prasthas of barley for the best horse and one prastha for each of the rest of the horses. He heard that the king had issued such-and-such a regulation, and that the venerable Ānanda had called out such-and-such, and thought, “Since I am not an inhabitant of this king’s country, the king cannot do anything against me.” He said to the venerable Ānanda, “O noble one Ānanda, I have prepared two prasthas of barley for my best horse and one prastha for each of the rest of the horses. If the Blessed One can eat barley, I will offer two prasthas of barley for the Blessed One and one prastha for each of the rest of the monks.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he reported this to the Blessed One in detail. The Blessed One thought, “The actions were performed and accumulated by me, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach me like a flood, inevitably. Who else but me  would experience the actions that I myself performed and accumulated? Actions performed and accumulated do not mature in the element of earth, . . . which are outside the body. . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.”</p>
<p>He instructed the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and distribute counting sticks and say, ‘Whoever among you can eat barley with the Tathāgata in Vairambhya for three months should take a counting stick.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, and he distributed the counting sticks. The Blessed One and four hundred ninety-eight monks took counting sticks.</p>
<p>“O Blessed One,” said the venerable Śāriputra, “since I have a wind illness, I cannot eat barley for three months.”</p>
<p>“I will take care of him,” offered the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One entered the rainy-season retreat with the four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya. The venerable Śāriputra and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana went to Mount Triśaṅku and there entered the rainy-season retreat. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, fed them with divine nectar. The caravan leader offered two prasthas of barley for the Blessed One and one prastha for each of the rest of the monks.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One instructed the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and have the barley cooked for the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, and he took the Blessed One’s portion and went to a certain old woman. When he arrived, he asked the woman, “Sister, can you cook barley for the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p>“O noble one,” she answered,  “I cannot, because I am too old. But since that girl is younger, have her do it. She will cook it.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then went to the younger woman and asked, “Sister, can you cook barley for the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p>“O noble one,” she answered, “if you promise to give me a discourse, I will.”</p>
<p>“Make ready,” he replied. “I will do so.”</p>
<p>Then she asked while grinding the barley, “O noble one, what is the Buddha?”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda thought, “Since the qualities of the Buddha are profound, it is likely that if I relate to her the praises of the Buddha, she will not be able to understand them. Now I will relate to her the praises of a wheel-turning king.” He said, “Sister, if a wheel-turning king appears in the world, seven treasures appear in the world, too. What are the seven? They are the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister.</p>
<p>“Sister, what is the precious chakra that appears in the world when a wheel-turning king appears in the world? Sister, here, when an anointed kṣatriya king, having washed his head and fasted on the day of poṣadha that is the fifteenth of the month, sits down on the terrace, surrounded by his ministers, the precious chakra appears from the east. It consists of a hub, a thousand spokes, and a rim and is perfect in every respect, fair, not made by an artisan, but excellent, and made entirely of gold. This anointed kṣatriya king thinks, ‘I have heard that on the day of poṣadha that is the fifteenth of the month  . . . made entirely of gold, he will be a wheel-turning king. Certainly I have become a wheel-turning king.’</p>
<p>“Then the wheel-turning king, wishing to examine the precious chakra, rises from his seat, puts his upper robe over one shoulder, kneels on his right knee, accepts the precious chakra with his hands, puts it on his left hand, and, raising it with his right hand, says, ‘O precious chakra, conquer, conquer through the noble path of wheel-turning kings of the past.’</p>
<p>“Then the precious chakra, having been raised by the wheel-turning king, soars up into the air and heads off to the east, through the noble path of wheel-turning kings of the past. Following the precious chakra, the wheel-turning king proceeds with his army consisting of four divisions. Wherever the precious chakra stays, the wheel-turning king with his army consisting of four divisions builds residences there. Those who are minor kings of the eastern region go to the wheel-turning king. When they arrive, they say to the wheel-turning king, ‘Come, Your Majesty. Welcome, Your Majesty. These countries, which are rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, are Your Majesty’s. May Your Majesty rule over them. We will do as Your Majesty orders.’</p>
<p>“He replies, ‘Then, lords, each of you should rule over each country lawfully, not unlawfully. If someone’s conduct is unlawful or a mixture of lawful and unlawful, you should not let him live in your country. In that way, you will be the ones who do as I order.’</p>
<p>“Then the precious chakra, having conquered the eastern region, returns from the eastern great ocean. It goes to the south, west, and north, through the noble path of wheel-turning kings of the past. Then, having been raised by the wheel-turning king, it soars up into the air and goes to the north, through the noble path of wheel-turning kings of the past.</p>
<p>“Following the precious chakra, the wheel-turning king proceeds with his army consisting of four divisions. Wherever the precious chakra stays, the wheel-turning king with his army consisting of four divisions builds residences there. Those who are minor kings of the northern region go to the wheel-turning king. When they arrive, they say to the wheel-turning king, ‘Come, Your Majesty. Welcome, Your Majesty. These countries, which are rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, are Your Majesty’s. May Your Majesty rule over them. We will do as Your Majesty orders.’</p>
<p>“He replies, ‘Then, lords, each of you should rule over each country lawfully, not unlawfully. If someone’s conduct is unlawful or a mixture of lawful and unlawful, you should not let him live in your country. In that way, you will be the ones who do as I order.’</p>
<p>“Then the precious chakra, having conquered the northern region, returns from the northern great ocean and stays on top of the treasury, just as an axis is placed.</p>
<p>“Sister, if a wheel-turning king appears in the world, such a precious chakra appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Sister, what is the precious elephant that appears in the world when a wheel-turning king appears in the world?</p>
<p>“Sister, here the elephant of a wheel-turning king is white as the color of a kumuda flower, and the seven parts of its body are well supported. It is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. Having seen this, his mind filled with joy, the wheel-turning king thinks, ‘Ah, this precious elephant is good. I will have it trained quickly.’</p>
<p>“Then the wheel-turning king summons a skillful elephant trainer by messenger and orders him, ‘O gentle sir, you should quickly train this precious elephant well and bring it to me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replies the skillful elephant trainer to the wheel-turning king, and he trains the precious elephant in all kinds of ways for one day. When he trains it in all kinds of ways for one day, it learns all of it in that very day. Just as other elephants learn all kinds of training only after being taught for many years, a great number of years, when the precious elephant is trained in all kinds of ways for just one day, it learns all of it in that very day. Knowing it to have been well trained, he brings it to the wheel-turning king and says, ‘Your Majesty, the good, precious elephant has been trained. May Your Majesty know it is the right time.’ Thereupon the wheel-turning king, wishing to examine the precious elephant, rides on the precious elephant at the time of sunrise, goes around the land as far as the seashore, and, having arrived at the very royal palace, has breakfast.</p>
<p>“Sister, if a wheel-turning king appears in the world, such a precious elephant appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Sister, what is the precious horse that appears in the world when a wheel-turning king appears in the world?</p>
<p>“Sister, here the horse of a wheel-turning king is entirely dark blue, with a black head  and lovely mane and back. It is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. When he sees it, his mind filled with joy, the wheel-turning king thinks, ‘Ah, this precious horse is good. I will have it trained quickly.’</p>
<p>“Then the wheel-turning king summons a skillful horse trainer by messenger and orders him, ‘O gentle sir, you should quickly train this precious horse well and then bring it to me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replies the skillful horse trainer to the wheel-turning king, and he trains the precious horse in all kinds of ways for one day. When he trains it in all kinds of ways for just one day, it learns all of it in that very day. Just as other horses learn all kinds of training only after being taught for many years, a great number of years, when the precious horse is trained in all kinds of ways for just one day, it learns all of it in that very day.</p>
<p>“Knowing it to have been well trained, he brings it to the wheel-turning king and says, ‘Your Majesty, the good, precious horse has been trained. May Your Majesty know it is the right time.’ Thereupon the wheel-turning king, wishing to examine the precious horse, rides on the precious horse at the time of sunrise, goes around the land as far as the seashore, and, having arrived at the royal palace, has breakfast.</p>
<p>“Sister, if a wheel-turning king appears in the world, such a precious horse appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Sister, what is the precious jewel that appears in the world when a wheel-turning king appears in the world?</p>
<p>“Sister, here the jewel of a wheel-turning king has eight sides and has its origin in excellent lapis lazuli. It is pure, bright, and clear. In the palace of the wheel-turning king all the functions of a lamp are performed by the light of that jewel.  Then, wishing to examine the precious jewel, the wheel-turning king goes to a park with an army consisting of four divisions, with the precious jewel placed on top of a banner when it is completely dark at night, it is raining slightly, and lightning flashes. The wheel-turning king’s entire army consisting of four divisions, and half a yojana around it, are then illuminated by the light of the jewel.</p>
<p>“Sister, if a wheel-turning king appears in the world, such a precious jewel appears in the world.</p>
<p>“Sister, what is the precious woman that appears in the world when a wheel-turning king appears in the world?</p>
<p>“Sister, here the queen of a wheel-turning king is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. Her skin is not excessively white or dark, nor is it colored like the madgura fish. She is not excessively tall or short, but well balanced in size, not excessively thin or fat or fleshy, but well proportioned in flesh. Sister, she is warm to the touch when it is cold, cool to the touch when it is hot, and as smooth to the touch as cloth from Kaliṅga. Sister, from every pore of skin on her entire body the perfume of sandalwood issues forth. From her mouth the perfume of the blue blossom of the utpala exudes.”</p>
<p>While the venerable Ānanda explained as far as the precious woman, the woman finished cooking the barley. She threw herself at the venerable Ānanda’s feet and made an aspiration: “O noble one, by this root of merit, may I become the precious woman of a wheel-turning king.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One, bringing the prepared barley. When he arrived, he offered it to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The buddhas, blessed ones, ask though they already know. The Buddha, the Blessed One, asked the venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, who prepared this barley?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, the brahmin’s daughter So-and-so did.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, did you have a conversation with her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, then tell me in detail all about the talk you had with the brahmin’s daughter.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then told the Blessed One in detail all about the talk he had had with the brahmin’s daughter. When the venerable Ānanda had thus spoken, the Blessed One said to him, “Ānanda, why did you not relate to the girl the praises of the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, I thought, ‘Since the qualities of the Buddha are profound, it is likely that she will not be able to understand them.’ Therefore, I told her the praises of a wheel-turning king.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, it wasn’t good that you did that. It is likely that if you had related to her the praises of the Buddha, she would have made a resolution to attain complete and supreme awakening without regression. Now, however, Ānanda, this girl will become the precious woman of a wheel-turning king.”</p>
<p>Then there was a loud shout: “The brahmin’s daughter So-and-so prepared barley for the Blessed One. The Blessed One predicted her to become the precious woman of a wheel-turning king!” When they heard this, four hundred ninety-eight girls prepared barley for the four hundred ninety-eight monks. They made an aspiration, too: “May we become her attendants!”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One started to eat the meal of barley, the venerable Ānanda became sad and shed tears, thinking,  “The Blessed One, who has made donations by cutting off his hands, feet, and head during such-and-such lives and has attained the state of knowing everything after three incalculably long eons, is now having a meal of rotten barley!”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why are you not pleased but shedding tears?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, I thought, ‘The Blessed One, who was born in the family of wheel-turning kings and has abandoned the throne and gone forth, who has given donations by cutting off his hands, feet, head, and so on during such-and-such lives and has attained the state of knowing everything after three incalculably long eons, is now having a meal of rotten barley!’ ”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “do you want to eat the barley meal from the Tathāgata’s own mouth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, O Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One spit out the barley meal from his mouth and gave it to the venerable Ānanda. The venerable Ānanda started to eat it. The Blessed One said, “Ānanda, have you ever experienced such a taste?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, although I have been born in the family of wheel-turning kings and have grown up in the family of wheel-turning kings, I have never experienced such a taste as that of the barley meal spat from the Blessed One’s mouth.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda, thus the Tathāgata has a clean tongue faculty called possessing the best taste. If the Tathāgata has even an ordinary meal, for him it becomes of a hundred flavors.”</p>
<p>Then there was a loud shout: “Agnidatta, the brahmin king, is staying in a concealed location, having invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for three months, and the Blessed One is having barley in Vairambhya!”</p>
<p>Neighboring kings heard this, too. They sent messengers to Agnidatta, the brahmin king, but the messengers were not able to enter the gate and stayed at the gate.</p>
<p>When he heard this, Anāthapiṇḍada, the householder, filled five hundred carriages with rice covered with leaves and dispatched them.</p>
<p>Then Māra the Evil One thought, “I have tried to torment the śramaṇa Gautama many times, but I have never had an opportunity for success. Here, once and for all, I will defeat him.” Having thought this, he changed into the venerable Ānanda and stood before the five hundred carriages. He asked, “Sirs, where are you going?”</p>
<p>They said, “O noble one Ānanda, Agnidatta, the brahmin king, is staying in a concealed location, having invited the Blessed One together with the community of disciples for three months, and the Blessed One is having barley in Vairambhya. When he heard this, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada then dispatched these five hundred carriages full of rice covered with leaves for the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“O sirs,” he replied, “gods, nāgas, and yakṣas have faith in the Blessed One. If the Blessed One raises his bowl in the air, the Thirty-Three Gods fill it with divine nectar. Why, then, would the Blessed One eat barley? Go back.”</p>
<p>“O noble one Ānanda, we have already departed,” they said. “How can we go back?”</p>
<p>Māra thought, “I cannot make them go back. I must devise a plan.” He soared up into the air and caused a heavy rain as if chariot axles were pouring down.  It rained until the hubs of the carriages disappeared beneath the water. Consequently, the oxen that had been tied to the carriages came untied and ran away.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One with the four hundred ninety-eight monks had barley in Vairambhya. The venerables Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana spent the rainy-season retreat on Mount Triśaṅku and enjoyed divine nectar.</p>
<p>After three months had passed, the caravan leader invited the Blessed One together with the community of disciples to a meal in a park. The Blessed One assented to him by remaining silent. The venerables Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, having spent the rainy-season retreat on Mount Triśaṅku, went there, too. Thereupon the caravan leader prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he threw himself at the feet of the Blessed One and made an aspiration: “By this root of merit may I become a wheel-turning king; may my best horse become my crown prince; may these five hundred horses become my five hundred sons; may the girl who was predicted by the Blessed One to become the precious woman become my precious woman; may the four hundred ninety-eight women become her attendants.”</p>
<p>Knowing the caravan leader’s mind with his own mind, the Blessed One said to him, “Caravan leader, you will become a wheel-turning king; your best horse will become your crown prince; the five hundred horses will become your five hundred sons; that girl will become your precious woman; those four hundred ninety-eight women will become her attendants.”</p>
<p>After three months had passed and the Blessed One had made and patched his robes,  he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go to Agnidatta, the brahmin king. After saluting him, say, ‘Great King, we have stayed in your country for three months. Farewell, we are going.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he went to the residence of Agnidatta, the brahmin king.</p>
<p>At that time Agnidatta, the brahmin king, was waiting for good luck. The venerable Ānanda said to a doorkeeper, “Sir, go to Agnidatta, the brahmin king. When you arrive, say to him, ‘The monk Ānanda wishes to see Your Majesty and is waiting at the door.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O noble one,” replied the doorkeeper to the venerable Ānanda, and he went to Agnidatta, the brahmin king. When he arrived, he said to him, “Your Majesty, the monk Ānanda, the noble one, wishes to see Your Majesty and is waiting at the door.”</p>
<p>“My man, I have been waiting for good luck,” said the king. “The monk Ānanda has great power of merit; he himself must be my good luck. He has five excellent points: an excellent name, excellent looks, excellent caste, excellent eloquence, and excellent perfection. Let him enter. Who would block the honorable Ānanda?”</p>
<p>The doorkeeper spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda, and the venerable Ānanda entered. The messengers of the neighboring kings entered with him, too. Thereupon the venerable Ānanda saluted Agnidatta, the brahmin king, and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,  the venerable Ānanda said to Agnidatta, the brahmin king, “Great King, the Blessed One salutes you and says, ‘Great King, we have stayed in your country for three months. Farewell, we are going.’ ”</p>
<p>“O noble one Ānanda, I bow to the Buddha, the Blessed One. O noble one Ānanda, has the Blessed One spent the rainy-season retreat in Vairambhya in comfort? Was there by chance any trouble with almsfood?”</p>
<p>The messengers of the neighboring kings said, “Your Majesty, you are no investigator of your own kingdom! Thus, having invited the Blessed One together with the community of disciples for three months, you stayed in a concealed location and the Blessed One had meals of rotten barley for three months!”</p>
<p>“O noble one Ānanda,” said the king, “is it true that the Blessed One had meals of rotten barley for three months?”</p>
<p>“It is true, Great King.”</p>
<p>The King fainted and fell to the ground. Having had much water poured on him, he recovered his senses. He called the ministers and asked them, “Sirs, did I not order you, ‘Prepare various kinds of food abundantly for five hundred people every day’?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” they answered, “although you did order thus, you did not tell us to whom to give the meal. However, the meal is still prepared today.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Agnidatta, the brahmin king, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed . . . Agnidatta, the brahmin king. When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king,  threw himself at the feet of the Blessed One and said, “O Blessed One, what a fault! O Sugata, what a fault! I was childish, foolish, dull, and ignorant to stay in a concealed location, having invited the Blessed One together with the community of disciples for three months.  O Blessed One, I know my fault, I see my fault. Please have compassion and forgive my fault.”</p>
<p>“Great King, you have admitted your fault as a fault. True, you were childish, foolish, dull, and ignorant to stay in a concealed location, having invited the Tathāgata for three months. Great King, you should know that if you know and see your fault and, having seen it, confess it, your good qualities will not be damaged but only increase. Why, Great King,? You should know that if anyone knows and sees his fault and, having seen it, confesses it and afterward makes a vow, his good qualities will not be damaged but only increase.”</p>
<p>Then Agnidatta, the brahmin king, said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for as long as I live: namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.”</p>
<p>“Great King,” said the Blessed One,  “the Tathāgata was born in a time of short lifespans, and there are many things to do for the benefit of people to be trained. And he has come close to the time for nirvāṇa. Therefore, I do not assent.”</p>
<p>“If so, may the Blessed One assent to my offer of the requisites for seven years, seven months, or seven days.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One did not assent to this either. Agnidatta, the brahmin king, said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One thought, “It is likely that if I do not assent to having even one meal from him, Agnidatta, the brahmin king, will die, vomiting hot blood.” Thus, the Blessed One assented by remaining silent. Agnidatta, the brahmin king, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, departed, and went to his residence. When he arrived, he asked the ministers, “Sirs, is there any good means whereby this whole meal could be consumed by the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” they answered, “if this entire meal is scattered on the ground and trampled underfoot by the monks, it will have been fully consumed.”</p>
<p>They ordered the laborers, “Sirs, scatter on the ground all the food there is.”</p>
<p>They scattered on the ground everything there was.</p>
<p>Thereupon Agnidatta, the brahmin king, prepared various kinds of pure and fine food during the night . . . . The Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. At that time a monk who had gone forth in his old age, unable to bear it, thought, “After we have eaten rotten barley for three months, this evil king shows off his riches.” He trampled on the various kinds of foods scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders criticized, insulted, and disparaged him: “Noble ones stamp with their feet on various kinds of food, which are meant for the mouth.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One thought, “The fault that occurred in this case was that the monks touched with their feet various kinds of food, which are meant for the mouth.” He said to the monks, “Monks, since the monk So-and-so, who had gone forth in his old age, unable to bear what had happened, trampled on the various kinds of food scattered on the ground, which were meant for the mouth, the brahmins and householders criticized, insulted, and disparaged him. Therefore, a monk should not trample with his feet various kinds of food, which are meant for the mouth. If he does so, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Agnidatta, the brahmin king, knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal, . . . knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Agnidatta, the brahmin king. The Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Agnidatta in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma,  then rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>C. Breaking a Hut</p>
<p>After the three months of the rainy season had passed, many monks, having made and patched their robes, went to the Blessed One. When they arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the many monks said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, we have stayed in the country of Vairambhya for three months. O Honored One, we will break the huts.”</p>
<p>“Monks, you should not break the huts. The longer the huts last, the more the donors’ merit increases and the more merit is generated. There are four things that are to be known as the outcomes of merits and virtues and the cause of the happiness of benefactors and donors. What are the four?</p>
<p>“If a virtuous monk who abides in good qualities lives in someone’s monastery, having actualized and perfected with his body immeasurable meditation, the outcomes of merits and virtues and the cause of the happiness of benefactors and donors should be known to be immeasurable for that reason.</p>
<p>“Just like the monastery, the same applies to robes, almsfood, and bedding and seats.</p>
<p>“The amount of the merits of the benefactors and donors who have these four outcomes of merits and virtues and the cause of happiness cannot be grasped as ‘the merit, the fruit of merit, or the fruit of merit that has matured is this much,’ but rather they can only be measured as a large mass of merits because of the sheer abundance of merit.</p>
<p>“Take, for instance, the place where the five great rivers—namely, the Ganges, Yamunā,  Sarayū, Ajiravatī, and Mahī—descend and converge, where the amount of water cannot be grasped as water, a pot of water, or a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand pots of water, but can only be measured as a great mass of water because of the sheer abundance of water. So, too, the amount of the merits of the benefactors and donors who have these four outcomes of merits and virtues and the cause of happiness cannot be grasped as ‘the merit, the fruit of merit, or the fruit of merit that has matured is this much,’ but they can only be measured as a large mass of merits.</p>
<p>“In the auspicious, pure ocean, in the best sea,</p>
<p>Which has pleasant shores and produces jewels,</p>
<p>The currents of each river,</p>
<p>On which humans and animals rely, gather.</p>
<p>“So, too, to a person who donates clothes, food, and drink,</p>
<p>After they have given bedding and seats and carpets,</p>
<p>Streams of merits gather from everywhere,</p>
<p>In the same way rivers descend to the ocean.”</p>
<p>D. A Brahmin Who Abused the Buddha Vipaśyin</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, the Blessed One has satisfied poor people through a multitude of merits by cutting off his hands, feet, head, and so on—he has tormented himself for the sake of beings during three incalculably long eons, and has done all that is to be done. And so what karma did he create that matured to cause him to have coarse barley with the four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya, while the venerables Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana had divine nectar?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” The Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in the past, in other lives, . . . . </p>
<p>“. . .</p>
<p>. . . bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, when people’s lifespans were eighty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Vipaśyin, who was a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. He stayed near a royal capital called Bandhumatī with eight hundred thousand monks who were his attendants.</p>
<p>“At that time in Bandhumatī, the royal capital, a brahmin schoolteacher was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred students. He was treated by everyone in the world with honor, looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man. After the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin arrived at Bandhumatī, the royal capital, however, none treated him with honor, looked up to him, esteemed him, or venerated him. He became very jealous of the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin and his community of disciples.</p>
<p>“Later, early one morning many monks—those who were undergoing training and those who had completed training—dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and entered Bandhumatī, the royal capital, for alms. Having seen them return with their bowls filled with various kinds of tasty sauce and rice, the brahmin demanded, ‘Hey, monks, let me see what almsfood you have obtained.’</p>
<p>“Since they were of honest character, they showed him the almsfood; being of jealous character, he found it unbearable. He called the young brahmins and said, ‘These shaven-headed śramaṇas are not worthy of eating various kinds of tasty sauce and rice, but of eating rotten barley!’</p>
<p>“They  agreed with him: ‘True, sir! True! These shaven-headed śramaṇas are not worthy of eating various kinds of tasty sauce and rice, but only of eating rotten barley.’</p>
<p>“Among them, there were two young brahmins who were pious and good and had a virtuous disposition. They said, ‘Sir, do not say that. These are great people and worthy of eating divine nectar, not rotten barley.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who criticized the attendants of the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Those who were the four hundred ninety-eight young brahmins are indeed these four hundred ninety-eight monks. Those two young brahmins who were pious and good and had a virtuous disposition are indeed these monks Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana. Because of the maturation of those actions—namely, my speaking harsh words out of malice toward the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin’s disciples who were undergoing training and had completed training, the four hundred ninety-eight young brahmins’ agreeing, and the two others’ disagreeing—the Tathāgata ate rotten barley with the four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya at that time, while Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana enjoyed divine nectar.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>VI. Ayodhyā</p>
<p>A. The Simile of a Log and the Going Forth of Nanda, the Herdsman</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Ayodhyā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda  to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, traveling through Southern Pañcāra, arrived in Ayodhyā, and stayed on the bank of the Ganges near Ayodhyā.</p>
<p>Thereupon a monk went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the monk said to the Blessed One, “O Blessed One, please teach me a condensed Dharma so that after I have listened to the condensed Dharma from the Blessed One, I will come to dwell alone, in solitude, not carelessly but diligently, directing myself toward myself. If I dwell alone, in solitude, not carelessly but diligently, directing myself toward myself, I will, in this life, by my own supernormal knowledge, actualize and accomplish the supreme end of the pure life for which the sons of noble families go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes, and understand: ‘My births have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ ”</p>
<p>The Blessed One was gazing at the Ganges, and when he saw a large log being carried along by its current, he asked the monk, “Monk, do you see that large log being carried along by the current of the Ganges?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>“If it reaches neither this bank, the opposite bank, nor the middle, is neither washed up on the land nor taken by humans or nonhumans, neither sinks in the water nor decays inside, monk, that large log will in due course flow down to the ocean, descend to the ocean,  have descended to the ocean. In this way, monk, if you reach neither this bank, . . . nor decay inside, monk, you will in due course flow down to nirvāṇa, descend to nirvāṇa, and have descended to nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, I do not understand what this bank is, what the opposite bank is, what touching the middle is, what being washed up on the land is, what being taken by humans is, what being taken by nonhumans is, what sinking in the water is, and what decaying inside is. O Blessed One, please teach me a condensed Dharma so that after I have listened to the condensed Dharma from the Blessed One, . . . ‘I will not know another existence after this one.’ ”</p>
<p>“Monk, this bank is a designation for the six internal sense spheres; the opposite bank is a designation for the six external sense spheres; touching the middle is a designation for desire for pleasure; being washed up on the land is a designation for self-conceit; being taken by humans means that here one lives together with people who have gone forth as well as lay people, shares pleasure and happiness with them, is happy at their happiness, suffers at their suffering, and undertakes and finishes tasks whenever they need to be done; being taken by nonhumans means that here one leads the pure life, having made this aspiration: ‘By this moral conduct, vow, ascetic practice, or pure life, may I become a god or the retainer of a god’; sinking in the water means that here, having abandoned the rules of training, one descends; decaying inside means that here one is a violator of moral conduct and possessor of evil qualities—one’s inside is rotten and leaking out like decayed wood, one behaves like a sheep or donkey, one falsely claims to be a śramaṇa, and one falsely claims to be leading the pure life. Monk, if you thus reach neither this bank, . . . you will . . . have descended to nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>The monk rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>Then the monk, instructed by the Blessed One through this teaching called the simile of the large log, dwelt alone, in solitude, not carelessly but diligently, directing himself toward himself. In that life, by his own supernormal knowledge, he actualized and accomplished the supreme end of the pure life for which the sons of noble families go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes. He knew and understood: “My births have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.” That venerable one became an arhat whose mind had been completely liberated.</p>
<p>At that time, near the Blessed One, a herdsman named Nanda stood, leaning on a stick and watching cattle. A frog was squashed by his stick. The frog, having had its vital organs cut and been split at its joints, gave rise to the thought, “If I move my body or utter a cry, by this cause I will prevent Nanda, the herdsman, from listening to the discourse.” Filled with faith in the Blessed One, it died and was born among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings.</p>
<p>Then Nanda, the herdsman, set his stick to one side and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. Having sat down, Nanda, the herdsman, said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I will reach neither this bank, the opposite bank, nor the middle; I will be neither washed up on the land nor taken by humans or nonhumans; and I will neither sink in the water nor decay inside. I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“Nanda, have you entrusted the cattle to their owners?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, I do not need to do that. Why? O Honored One, since the cows are young and the calves are mature, and each of them knows its own cattle shed, each will go to its home. I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“Nanda, since the cows are young and the calves are mature, and each of them knows its own cattle shed, each will go to its home. But a herdsman who obtains food and clothing from the owners should do this for them.”</p>
<p>Then Nanda, the herdsman, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed from the Blessed One’s presence. Thereupon, he began to run, crying loudly, “Fear! Fear!” On the way, five hundred herdsmen who were his acquaintances saw him and asked, “Fear of what?”</p>
<p>“Fear of birth; fear of old age; fear of death!”</p>
<p>They, too, began to run, following after him.  Seeing them, other herdsmen, shepherds, herb gatherers, wood gatherers, people who make a living properly, and people who make a living improperly began to run, following after them. People on the way saw them crying and asked, “Sirs, what’s happening?”</p>
<p>“Fear!” they answered.</p>
<p>“Fear of what?”</p>
<p>“Fear of birth; fear of old age; fear of death!”</p>
<p>Having heard this, they turned back. They came to a hamlet, and then the people living in the hamlet ran hither and thither, frightened to see the many people. Some escaped, some hid their things, some stood in armor. Some brave men approached the people and asked, “Sirs, what’s happening?”</p>
<p>“Fear!” they answered.</p>
<p>“Fear of what?”</p>
<p>“Fear of birth; fear of old age; fear of death!”</p>
<p>Then the inhabitants of the hamlet were relieved.</p>
<p>At that time the venerable Śāriputra was sitting in that very assembly. The venerable Śāriputra then asked the Blessed One, knowing that it had not been a long time since Nanda, the herdsman, had departed, “O Honored One, why did the Blessed One let Nanda, the herdsman, who wishes to go forth in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya, go back home?”</p>
<p>“Śāriputra, it is impossible, out of the question, that Nanda, the herdsman, will dwell at home again as a layman. It is impossible that he will enjoy the objects of desire by hoarding. Now Nanda, the herdsman, will come, having entrusted the cattle to the owners, and will actualize and accomplish the supreme end of the pure life for which the sons of noble families go forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes,  and understand: ‘My births have been exhausted. The pure life has been lived. What is to be done has been done. I will not know another existence after this one.’ ”</p>
<p>After that, Nanda, the herdsman, having entrusted the cattle to the owners, did go to the Blessed One, with five hundred people around him. Having arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I have entrusted the cattle to the owners. O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>In the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya, Nanda, the herdsman, went forth and was ordained a monk with the five hundred people around him. Having gone forth, the Honored One . . . became an arhat whose mind had been completely liberated.</p>
<p>It is natural for gods or goddesses to give rise to three thoughts just after birth: namely, where they died, where they were reborn, and by what action. The god who had once been the frog observed that he had died in the animal world, that he had been born among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, and that this was because he had gained faith in the Blessed One. Then he thought, “Since it would not be appropriate for me to let any days pass before going to see and serve the Blessed One, I will by all means go now to see and serve the Blessed One before any days have passed.”</p>
<p>Then the god who had once been the frog put on untarnished, swinging earrings, . . .   illuminating the entire neighborhood of the bank of the Ganges with a vast display of light, scattered the flowers for the Blessed One, and sat down in front of the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma.  The Blessed One knew the thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature of the god who had once been the frog and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for the god and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  When the god had heard the Dharma, with the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. . . . “. . . O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, like a merchant who had obtained merchandise, like a farmer who had gotten a bumper crop, like a warrior who had won a battle, like a patient who had been cured of every disease, the god who had once been the frog went to his house with the same majesty with which he had come into the presence of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>As the monks were exerting themselves in the maintenance of vigilance during the first and last watches of the night, when they saw the vast display of light appear before the Blessed One, they were perplexed and asked the Blessed One, “What was that? O Blessed One, did Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, or Śakra, Lord of the Gods, or the Four Protectors of the World come to see the Blessed One last night?”</p>
<p>“Monks, it was not Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World,  or Śakra, Lord of the Gods, or the Four Protectors of the World who came to see me. A frog, while he was squashed by the stick of Nanda, the herdsman, having had his vital organs cut, and been split at his joints, did not move or utter a cry, thinking that if he did so, he would prevent Nanda, the herdsman, from listening to the discourse. His mind filled with faith in me, he died and was born among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings. He came to see me last night, saw the truths when I preached Dharma to him, and went to his house.”</p>
<p>B. The Former Lives of Nanda and the Frog</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did Nanda, the herdsman, and the five hundred people around him create that matured to cause them to be born among herdsmen, go forth in the teachings of the Blessed One, abandon all the defilements, and actualize the state of an arhat? What karma did the god who had once been a frog create that matured to cause him to be born among frogs and then see the truths?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Monks, the actions were performed and accumulated by him, . . . </p>
<p>“. . .</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lives were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, . . . . He stayed in the Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“In the teachings of that buddha, this Nanda, the herdsman, went forth and became a preacher of Dharma well versed in the three divisions of the canon, of eloquence tied to reason and free from obstacles, possessing five hundred attendants, and skillful in dealing with disputes. Every time a dispute arose in the community, he settled it. But there were two haughty, proud monks who had never gone to him. Later, a dispute arose between these two;  because of this matter, they went to him, paid homage at his feet, and requested, ‘Since such-and-such a dispute has arisen between the two of us, please settle it.’</p>
<p>“He thought, ‘If I settle their dispute today, then these two will no longer depend on me, and so they will not come to me afterward.’ He gathered the entire community and raised the dispute in the middle of the community, but he did not issue any decision. The next day he went to a certain hamlet, for he had some business there. Then the two monks themselves raised the dispute in the middle of the community lest the settlement of it be delayed, and it was settled by the community. The monk well versed in the three divisions of the canon returned from the hamlet. After he had rested well from the journey, he asked his co-resident monks and pupils, ‘Did the two, the disputer and his opponent, not come?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O master, the dispute has been settled,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Who settled it?’</p>
<p>“ ‘The community did.’</p>
<p>“ ‘How did they do it?’</p>
<p>“When they had explained the matter in detail, he created the karma of harsh speech: ‘The venerable ones are ignorant: they settled that dispute just as herdsmen do!’</p>
<p>“They, too, agreed with him: ‘True, O master! They settled the dispute just as herdsmen do.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the monk well versed in the three divisions of the canon at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this herdsman Nanda. Those who were his five hundred co-resident monks and pupils are indeed these five hundred herdsmen. Because of the maturation of the karma created by them, namely, his saying the word ‘herdsmen’ to the community of disciples of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, and the agreeing of his co-resident monks and pupils, he and the five hundred attendants were born among herdsmen for five hundred lives.  And since he was well versed in the aggregates, elements, sense spheres, dependent origination, and what is proper and what is improper through recitation and repetition, he with the five hundred people around him went forth in my teaching, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Monks, furthermore, the god who had once been a frog was a meditator monk in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. One time, he traveled to a monastery near a hamlet. In the first watch of the night, he sat down with his legs crossed and began to practice concentration of the mind. At that time reciter monks were reciting. Since dhyāna is disturbed by voices, he was unable to concentrate his mind on a single point due to the voices. He thought, ‘Let them recite. I will meditate in the middle watch.’ When he got up in the middle watch and sat down, other monks were reciting. He thought, ‘I will meditate in the last watch.’ When he got up in the last watch and sat down, other monks were reciting. Since he was not free from desire, he said in fierce anger, ‘These śramaṇas of Kāśyapa were noisy as frogs all night long!’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the meditator monk at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this god who had once been a frog. Because of the maturation of the karma created by him, namely, his saying the word ‘frogs’ to the disciples of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, he was born among frogs for five hundred lives, and now he was still born among frogs. Because he had gained faith, he was reborn among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings.  Because he led the pure life in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, here he saw the truths.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.” Thus spoke the Blessed One.</p>
<p>VII. The Ganges</p>
<p>A. Haṃsas, Fish, and Turtles</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One crossed the Ganges. There five hundred haṃsas, fish, and turtles surrounded and circumambulated him. The Blessed One preached the Dharma to them that consists of three phrases: “Sirs, all conditioned things are impermanent; all phenomena are selfless; and nirvāṇa is peace. Make your mind filled with faith in me, and by all means become free from desire for rebirth in the animal world.”</p>
<p>“It would not be appropriate for us to eat food in front of the Blessed One after having heard the Dharma that consists of three phrases,” they thought, and so they fasted. Since those who are born in the animal world have great digestive fire, they died. After they died, they were reborn among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings.</p>
<p>It is natural for gods or goddesses to give rise to three thoughts just after birth: namely, where they died, where they were reborn, and by what action. They observed that they had died in the animal world, that they had been born among the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, . . . filled the front part of their garments with . . . mandārava flowers, illuminated the vicinity of the Blessed One with a display of light, scattered the flowers for the Blessed One, and sat down surrounding the Blessed One.  The Blessed One knew their thinking, proclivity,  disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them and that caused them to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. With the vajra of knowledge they leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. After having seen the truths, they spoke an inspired utterance three times: “O Honored One, what the Blessed One has done for us is what has never been done for us by our fathers, our mothers, our kinsmen and relatives, our wives, a king, gods, our ancestral spirits, śramaṇas, or brahmins. You have pulled us out from the states of hell and hungry ghosts, placed us among the gods and humans, caused us to leave the course of rebirth far behind, dried up the ocean of blood and tears, liberated us from the mountain of bones, shut the gate to inferior states of existence, and opened the gate to heaven and liberation. With the vajra of knowledge we have leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. O Honored One, we have been exalted, truly exalted. Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, please accept us as lay brothers. From today onward, we embrace our faith as ones who seek refuge throughout our life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the gods who had once been the fish, haṃsas, and turtles, like a merchant who had obtained merchandise, . . . went to their houses.</p>
<p>B. The Former Lives of the Haṃsas, Fish, and Turtles</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of  the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did the fish, haṃsas, and turtles create that matured to cause them to be born among haṃsas, fish, and turtles? What karma did they create that matured to cause them to be born among gods and to see the truths?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by these sons of gods who had once been haṃsas, fish, and turtles themselves, accruing a heap of karma. . . .</p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, . . . . He stayed in Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī. In his teaching these gods went forth. There these monks transgressed the minor rules of training; that karma matured to cause them to be reborn among fish, haṃsas, and turtles. Because they had gained faith in me, they were reborn among the gods. Because they led the pure life in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, they saw the truths.  Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>VIII. Hungry Ghosts</p>
<p>A. The Conversation with the Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had crossed the Ganges, he was surrounded by five hundred hungry ghosts who were just like burnt logs or raised skeletons, covered with hair, whose bellies were just like mountains, whose mouths were just like pinholes, who were burning, thoroughly burning, thoroughly and entirely burning, blazing as a single flame. They made the gesture of supplication and said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, we hungry ghosts  have inferior bodies and are unable to obtain even water because of our sinful past actions, not to mention food. You are of great compassion; please give us water.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One indicated the Ganges to them:</p>
<p>“This cool water to be enjoyed by all people,</p>
<p>This great river Bhāgīrathī, flows,</p>
<p>Satisfying villages, provinces, and cities.</p>
<p>It produces rice of the field, kumuda, and utpala.”</p>
<p>The hungry ghosts said:</p>
<p>“This river to be enjoyed by all people,</p>
<p>The Bhāgīrathī, does flow, but this is dry for us.</p>
<p>We see this full of the impurity of blood</p>
<p>And guarded by ones holding in their hands sticks and axes.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to the deity of the Ganges:</p>
<p>“Satisfying villages, provinces, and cities,</p>
<p>You produce rice of the field, kumuda, utpala, and paṅkaja.</p>
<p>Why do you not satisfy the hungry ghosts who suffer from thirst?</p>
<p>You lack mercy for these foolish creatures.”</p>
<p>The deity of the Ganges said:</p>
<p>“To foolish creatures I give water unequally neither because of fear,</p>
<p>Nor because of their harsh words, nor because of their deceitfulness.</p>
<p>But for these ones, who have committed evil actions and are veiled by great obscurations,</p>
<p>The river is dry; how is any of this my fault?”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One instructed the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, pour water on the hungry ghosts.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, and he started to pour water on the hungry ghosts, but he was unable to expand the hungry ghosts’ mouths, which were as small as pinholes. The Blessed One then expanded their mouths using his magical power, and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana poured water in. Suffering from thirst, they drank so much that their bellies swelled. Then they died, having harbored such pure minds for the Blessed One . . . after having seen the truths, they left for their own residences.</p>
<p>B. The Previous Lives of the Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did these hungry ghosts create that matured to cause them to be born among hungry ghosts? What karma did they create that matured to cause them to be born among gods and see the truths?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Monks, the actions were performed and accumulated by themselves, accruing a heap of karma. . . . .</p>
<p>“. . .</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa . . . . He stayed in the Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“His disciples used to beg for alms out of faith and served the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha. When the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa’s teaching was not extensive, there were few monks who asked for alms out of faith. When it became extensive, there were many such monks. At that time, when five hundred lay brothers were meeting together in an assembly hall for some business, many monks asking for alms out of faith went to them, wishing to receive alms. The lay brothers, in fierce anger, created the karma of harsh speech: ‘These śramaṇas of Kāśyapa always hold out their hands as if they have been born as hungry ghosts.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? Those five hundred lay brothers were indeed these five hundred hungry ghosts. Because of the maturation of the karma—namely, their saying the words ‘hungry ghosts’ to the disciples of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa—they were born among hungry ghosts for five hundred lives,  and now they were also born among hungry ghosts. Because they had gained faith in me, they were reborn among the gods. Because they sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training, they saw the truths.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.” Thus spoke the Blessed One.</p>
<p>IX. Velāma</p>
<p>After the Blessed One had crossed the Ganges, he looked back at the river, turning to the right just as an elephant does. The monks asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, on account of what did the Blessed One look back at the Ganges, turning to the right?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “do you want to hear the origin of the Ganges?”</p>
<p>“O Honored One, now it is the right time. O Sugata, now it is the right time. If the Blessed One explains the origin of the Ganges, the monks will listen to it.”</p>
<p>“Monks, once there appeared a righteous Dharma king named Piṇḍavaṃśa. In accordance with the Dharma, he ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, where trees were always full of blossoms and fruits, and the gods brought rain at the appropriate times so that the fields produced rich crops. There was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, robbers, famine, or illness there, and the people were always absorbed in the Dharma.</p>
<p>“When spring came, the king, surrounded by his consorts, went to a park in a forest where the trees were budding and birds such as haṃsas, cranes, peacocks, parrots,  hill mynas, cuckoos, and jīvaṃjīvakas were singing.</p>
<p>“At that time, he saw a man hobbling about on a cane, taking slow steps. His body was full of wrinkles, his head was gray, his limbs were weak, his faculties were frail, his flesh was wizened, and his energy was feeble. The king asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, what is this man hobbling about on a cane, whose body is full of wrinkles, whose head is gray . . . ?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,” they answered, “he is said to be an old, aged man because of the loss of his conditioning factors.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, will such a thing happen to me, too?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, this is common to everyone,’ the ministers answered.</p>
<p>“The king departed, feeling melancholy. Then he saw a pale man with his body in bandages, limping about on a cane with much sighing. His body was covered with cuts and sores, his belly was concave like a valley, and his major limbs and minor appendages were covered with wounds that oozed pus. Having seen him, the king again asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, what is this pale man limping about on a cane . . .?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they answered, “he is called one afflicted with illness.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, will such a thing happen to me, too?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the ministers answered, ‘this is common to everyone. As a result of faults that they committed in the past, this happens to people who have performed sinful acts.’</p>
<p>“The king departed, thinking, ‘One should not perform evil acts by any means.’ Then he saw a bier decorated with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth, surrounded by parasols, banners, flags,  conch shells, paṭaha drums, men, women, boys, and girls. It was shouldered by four men, preceded by a person carrying a fire, followed by a man carrying firewood, and people crying everywhere, ‘Alas! Father!’ ‘Alas! Son!’ ‘Alas! Brother!’ ‘Alas! Husband!’ When he saw this, he again asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, what is this bier decorated with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth . . . and people crying?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the ministers answered, ‘this is called a dead man.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, will such a thing happen to me, too?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, this is common to everyone,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Having seen the old man, the sick man, and the dead man, the king felt melancholy. He went home and stayed in the lamentation room, thinking, ‘I will no longer be able to take pleasure in my present enjoyments.’</p>
<p>“In his land, there was a brahmin named Velāma, who was rich and had great wealth and many possessions. He heard that the king felt melancholy and was staying in the lamentation room, having seen an old man, a sick man, and a dead man. Upon hearing this, he went to King Piṇḍavaṃśa, riding an entirely white chariot pulled by mares, carrying a golden water jar with a handle, and surrounded by hundreds of thousands of brahmins. When he arrived, the ministers said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, Brahmin Velāma is standing at the door.’</p>
<p>“The king then left the room and sat in the treasury. After wishing the king victory and long life, and having sat down, Brahmin Velāma asked, ‘Your Majesty, why are you staying in the lamentation room?’</p>
<p>“The king told the brahmin Velāma in detail all about what had happened. The brahmin said, ‘Your Majesty, since beings in this world experience the fruit of their karma,  you do not need to lament about this. There are beings that create good karma, that create evil karma, and that create both. Wheel-turning kings always create good karma and, after their death, are reborn among the gods. Your Majesty is a wheel-turning king, too; you will experience divine happiness after experiencing the best human happiness. Nonetheless, Your Majesty, you should exert yourself in making offerings, which is the staircase to heaven.’</p>
<p>“The king ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, proclaim this throughout the country with the ringing of bells: “The king will make a limitless offering; you should come and enjoy it.” ’</p>
<p>“The king then had an offering hall built and gave food to those who sought food, and drink to those who sought drink.</p>
<p>“There a pit was dug to pour the water used for boiling rice (ācāma). Since the hot water became cold when it was poured there, the pit was named Anavatapta, ‘unheated.’ After twelve years, the water used for boiling rice and the water used for washing rice flowed out as a river through a valley, and the river was named Ācāma River.”</p>

<p>I. Kumāravardhana</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One arrived in the country of Kumāravardhana, where he said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, in this place a king named Upoṣadha was born and grew up. Therefore, this city was named Kumāravardhana.”</p>
<p>II. Krauñcāna</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Krauñcāna and said to the venerable Ānanda,  “Ānanda, since the excellent elephant of King Upoṣadha uttered the cry ‘krauñca, krauñca’ in this Krauñcāna, the place was named Krauñcāna.”</p>
<p>III. Aṅgadikā</p>
<p>Having gone to Aṅgadikā, in a certain place in Aṅgadikā the Blessed One smiled . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail).</p>
<p>IV. Maṇivatī</p>
<p>Having gone to Maṇivatī, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda there, “Ānanda, since the Bodhisattva made an offering of many jewels (maṇi) in this Maṇivatī, this place was named Maṇivatī (Where There Are Jewels).”</p>
<p>V. Sālabalā</p>
<p>Having gone to Sālabalā, in a certain place in Sālabalā the Blessed One smiled . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail).</p>
<p>VI. Sālibalā</p>
<p>Having gone to Sālibalā, in a certain place in Sālibalā the Blessed One smiled . . . (the phrase about the seat of four buddhas should be recited in detail).</p>
<p>VII. Suvarṇaprastha</p>
<p>Having gone to Suvarṇaprastha, the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, in this Suvarṇaprastha the Bodhisattva made an offering of much gold (suvarṇa). Today brahmins still distribute gold, weighing it in units of prastha. Therefore, this place was named Suvarṇaprastha.”</p>
<p>VIII. Sāketā</p>
<p>Having gone to Sāketā, the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda there, “ Ānanda, in this Sāketā a king named Upoṣadha ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  One day a soft, fleshy tumor developed on the crown of his head; it was exceptionally soft, just like tūla cotton or karpāsa cotton, and caused no pain. When it had fully enlarged, it burst open and a boy emerged from it. He was well proportioned, attractive, pleasant to behold, and gold in complexion . . . and every major limb and minor appendage of his body was complete. Since he was born (jāta) from the crown of the head (mūrdhni), he was named Mūrdhnāta.</p>
<p>“Soon after the prince was born, King Upoṣadha brought him to the harem, where there were sixty thousand consorts.  As soon as they saw the prince, milk squirted out from each consort’s breasts, and they said, ‘May he suckle at my breast (*mān dhayatu)!’ Therefore, he was named Māndhātṛ. Some people knew him there as Mūrdhnāta, and others as Māndhātṛ.</p>
<p>“Once, when Prince Māndhātṛ was away in the countryside, King Upoṣadha became sick. Although he was provided with medicines derived from roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits, the illness just kept on getting worse. He ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, quickly anoint the prince as king.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“The ministers sent a messenger, saying, ‘King Upoṣadha has become sick and says, “Call the prince and let him accept the royal anointing.” Hence the prince should come quickly.’ When the messenger had departed, King Upoṣadha died. Then the ministers sent another messenger to the prince, saying, ‘O Prince, your father has passed away. Please come and accept the kingdom.’</p>
<p>“Prince Māndhātṛ stayed there, thinking, ‘Since my father has passed away, why do I need to go there?’</p>
<p>The ministers again met together and sent the prime minister as a messenger. He went to the prince and requested, ‘O Prince, please come and accept the kingdom.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I obtain the kingdom according to the Dharma,’ replied the prince, ‘the royal anointing will take place here.’</p>
<p>“The ministers sent a message: ‘Your Majesty, the royal anointing requires many things. We perform the royal anointing in the palace on a jeweled floor with a throne, parasol, crown, and bracelet. Therefore, the prince must come to this very place.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I obtain the kingdom according to the Dharma,’ replied the prince,  ‘everything necessary will appear here.’</p>
<p>“A yakṣa named Divaukasa, attendant on Prince Māndhātṛ, brought there a jeweled floor and throne. People living in the palace then spontaneously came together, bringing a parasol, crown, and bracelet. Since the people living in the palace spontaneously (svayaṃ) came (āgata), the place was named Sāketā.”</p>
<p>IX. Rice Soup</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Śrāvastī.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One traveled to Śrāvastī. In a certain place, a brahmin was plowing a field. He had not had a meal, and a girl brought rice soup for him. The Blessed One also came to that place.</p>
<p>As soon as the brahmin saw the Buddha, the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns, faith in the Blessed One arose in him.</p>
<p>Whenever a being who has accumulated roots of merit looks at the Buddha for the first time, he experiences far greater pleasure than that of those who have practiced tranquility of mind for a dozen years, those who gain a son after having been childless, those who look upon treasure after having been poor, or those who are anointed as king after having longed for kingship.</p>
<p>The brahmin quickly went to the Blessed One, bringing the rice soup. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Gautama, this is rice soup. If the Honorable Gautama has compassion for me,  please accept this rice soup.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One indicated to the brahmin an old well and said, “Brahmin, if you are giving it completely, pour it into this old well.”</p>
<p>The brahmin poured it into the old well. When he had done this, by the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods, the old well became piping hot, full of rice soup. The Blessed One then called the brahmin and said, “Brahmin, distribute the rice soup.”</p>
<p>When he began to distribute it, the Blessed One exercised his magical power so that even when the entire community had eaten it, the old well remained piping hot, full of rice soup. After that, his faith in the Blessed One increased all the more, the brahmin paid homage at the Blessed One’s feet and sat down in front of him in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for him and that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones.  . . . With the vajra of knowledge he leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. “O Honored One, I have been exalted, truly exalted. Since I seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, may you accept me as a lay brother. From today onward, I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge throughout my life.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, like a merchant who had obtained merchandise, like a farmer who had gotten a bumper crop, like a warrior who had won a battle, like a patient who had been cured of every disease, having rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One,  the brahmin bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and he departed from the Blessed One’s presence. When he arrived at the field, he saw golden barley growing there. Upon seeing it, his eyes opened wide with astonishment and he spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“How great the field is, which has</p>
<p>The nature of merit and is free from all faults—</p>
<p>From seeds I sowed today,</p>
<p>Fruit was harvested just today.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin hurried to the king. When he arrived, he wished the king victory and long life and said, “Your Majesty, the barley I sowed has become gold. Please appoint an overseer there.”</p>
<p>The king appointed an overseer and sent him. The brahmin piled the gold up and divided it, but the king’s portion changed into ordinary barley. The overseer reported this to the king, and then the king ordered, “Have it divided again.” When he divided the barley again, still the king’s portion changed into ordinary barley. He divided it seven times in all, only to have the same result each time. Prompted by curiosity, the king himself went there and watched, and the result was the same. He said to the brahmin, “Brahmin, since this has been produced by your merit, the king’s portion is no longer required. Give me what you have measured.”</p>
<p>Then the brahmin was much delighted, and what he gave became gold.</p>
<p>A. The Peasants’ Going Forth and the Oxen’s Rebirth in Heaven</p>
<p>After that, the Blessed One departed. At that time, in a certain place, five hundred peasants were plowing a field, looking pale, their feet and hands covered with cuts, and wearing hempen lower garments. The oxen, too, were plowing the field with sighs, their bodies hurt and wounded by being struck with spiked sticks, pus oozing from their wounds. The peasants then saw the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man,  illuminated by the eighty minor marks, ornamented with a fathom-wide halo, and beautiful like a moving mountain of jewels with light surpassing a thousand suns. Whenever beings who have accumulated roots of merit look at the Buddha for the first time . . . .</p>
<p>They then approached the Blessed One. When from a distance the Blessed One saw the peasants coming, he left the road and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks in order to convert the peasants. The peasants bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. The Blessed One knew the peasants’ thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them and that caused them to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones . . . . With the vajra of knowledge they leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality that had been accumulated since beginningless time, and actualized the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>After having seen the truths, they made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One and said to him, “O Honored One, we wish to go forth and be ordained monks in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. We will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One ordained them by saying, “Come, monk,” . . . .</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>And their bodies swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>The Blessed One instructed them. Endeavoring and striving, they . . . became objects of . . . praise.</p>
<p>The oxen, too, went to the Blessed One, having broken their yokes and the ropes around their horns. When they arrived, they sat down, surrounding the Blessed One. The Blessed One preached the Dharma that consists of three phrases for them, . . . having seen the truths, they left for their own residence, just as the haṃsas, fish, and turtles did when the Blessed One was on the bank of the Ganges.</p>
<p>B. The Former Lives of the Peasants and Oxen</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did these monks who were once peasants create that matured to cause them, after being peasants, to go forth in the teachings of the Blessed One, abandon all the defilements, and actualize the state of an arhat? What karma did these gods who had once been oxen create that matured to cause them to be born among oxen and see the truths?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Monks, the actions were performed and accumulated by themselves, accruing a heap of karma . . . .</p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once, in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa . . . . He stayed in the Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī. In his teachings, these five hundred peasants went forth. There they did not recite, repeat, or practice concentration of the mind but rather were attached to the crowd and spent their time lazily, having enjoyed things given out of faith.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? Those five hundred monks were indeed these five hundred peasants. The owner of the monastery was indeed this householder who is the master of these peasants. Because of the maturation of the karma—namely, their not reciting, repeating, or practicing concentration of the mind and their being attached to the crowd and spending time lazily, having enjoyed things given out of the faith of the owner of the monastery—they were the peasants of the owner of the monastery for five hundred lives, and now they were also born among peasants. Because they went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and led the pure life, they now went forth in my teaching, abandoned all the defilements, and actualized the state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“These gods who had once been oxen, too, went forth in the teachings of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. They transgressed the minor rules of training; that karma matured to cause them to be reborn among oxen. Because they had gained faith in me, they were reborn among the gods. Because they led the pure life and protected it in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, they now saw the truths, becoming gods.  Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative . . . you should seek. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>C. Toyikā</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, let us go to Toyikā.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The Blessed One went to Toyikā, and in a certain place, a brahmin was plowing a field. Then the brahmin saw the Buddha, the Blessed One, whose body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man , illuminated by the eighty minor marks, . . . and beautiful . . . . He thought, “If I go to the Honorable Gautama to greet him, my work will fail. But if I do not go to greet him, my merit will fail. In this regard, is there any good means whereby neither my work nor my merit will fail?” A good idea then occurred to him: “If I greet him, staying here, neither my work nor my merit will fail.” He greeted him, holding a spiked stick and staying in that very spot: “Greetings to the Buddha, the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, this brahmin is wrong. If that man had been wise enough to know for himself that there was the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa in this place, he would have come to me and greeted me. Then he would have greeted two perfectly awakened ones. Why? Ānanda, the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa is in this place.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Ānanda quickly folded his upper robe in four, laid it down, and said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please sit on this prepared seat, and then this place will have been enjoyed by two perfectly awakened ones, namely, the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and now the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One did sit on the prepared seat.  After sitting for a moment, he said to the monks, “Monks, do you want to see the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, it is the right time. O Sugata, it is the right time. If the Blessed One reveals the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa to the monks so that they see it, their minds will be filled with faith.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, living creatures, including those as small as ants, understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. Nāgas thought, “For the sake of what did the Blessed One entertain mundane thoughts?” They saw that the Blessed One wanted to see the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, and so they raised the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. The Blessed One then said to the monks, “Monks, as it is going to sink, grasp its characteristics,” and then the skeleton sank.</p>
<p>When King Prasenajit heard that the Blessed One had shown the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa to the disciples, prompted by curiosity he departed with his consort, sons, ministers, army, citizens, and provincial dwellers. In the same manner, Virūḍhaka, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada, Ṛṣidatta, the bricklayer Purāṇa, Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā, and hundreds of thousands of beings departed, prompted by curiosity  and spurred by their previous roots of merit. But the skeleton had already sunk. When they heard that the unbroken skeleton of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa had sunk, they felt pain and despair, thinking, “We have come here in vain.”</p>
<p>A lay brother circumambulated the spot and pondered in his mind, “How much will the merit from my circumambulation here be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing the lay brother’s mind with his own mind, spoke a verse in order to remove the many people’s regret:</p>
<p>“If a wise person with a purified mind</p>
<p>Circumambulates a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand coins of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Another lay brother placed a lump of clay on the spot and pondered in his mind, “The Blessed One said that the merit from circumambulation was so much; how much will the merit from placing a lump of clay here be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing the lay brother’s mind with his own mind, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If, with a purified mind,</p>
<p>One places a lump of clay in a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand lumps of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, hundreds of thousands of beings piled up lumps of clay.</p>
<p>Other people placed flower petals on the spot and pondered in their minds, “The Blessed One said that the merit from circumambulation and a lump of clay was so much;  as for our flower petals, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If, out of a pure mind,</p>
<p>One scatters flower petals on a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand baskets of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Other people surrounded the spot with garlands of flowers and pondered in their minds, “The Blessed One said that the merit from flower petals was so much; as for our surrounding it with garlands of flowers, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If a wise person with a purified mind</p>
<p>Surrounds a shrine of the Buddha with garlands of flowers,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand coffers of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Other people donated rows of lamps there and pondered in their minds, “The Blessed One said that the merit from surrounding it with garlands of flowers was so much; as for our donating rows of lamps, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind, spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If a wise person with a purified mind</p>
<p>Donates lamps to a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even ten million srang of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Other people sprinkled perfumed water and pondered in their minds, “The Blessed One said that the merit from donating rows of lamps was so much; as for our sprinkling perfumed water, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind,  spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“If a wise person with a purified mind</p>
<p>Sprinkles perfumed water on a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand heaps of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.”</p>
<p>Other people raised parasols, banners, and flags and pondered in their minds, “The Blessed One said that the merit from circumambulation, placing a lump of clay, scattering flower petals, surrounding with garlands of flowers, donating rows of lamps, and sprinkling perfumed water was so much; as for our raising parasols, banners, and flags, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind, spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“If, out of a pure mind,</p>
<p>One raises parasols, banners, and flags in a shrine of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Even a hundred thousand Meru-like mountains of gold from the Jambū River</p>
<p>Cannot compare with that act.</p>
<p>“Thus the offering</p>
<p>To the Perfectly Awakened One, who resembles the great ocean,</p>
<p>The immeasurable Tathāgata,</p>
<p>Supreme caravan leader, has been explained.”</p>
<p>They asked themselves, “The Blessed One said that the merit from worshiping the Blessed One who has been completely emancipated was so much; as for the Blessed One who is present, how much will the merit be?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One, knowing their minds with his own mind, spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“The merits of those who offer worship out of pure minds</p>
<p>To a living one</p>
<p>And to one who has been completely emancipated are equal—</p>
<p>Here there is no distinction between them.</p>
<p>“Thus, the Buddha is inconceivable;</p>
<p>The Buddha’s Dharma is also inconceivable.</p>
<p>The maturation of faith in the inconceivable</p>
<p>Is also inconceivable.</p>
<p>“It is impossible to understand the good qualities of the perfectly awakened ones, who are unknowable and turn the wheel of the Dharma  without obstacles.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One preached the Dharma to the many people so that, having heard it, hundreds of thousands of beings attained great excellence. Some made a resolution to attain the awakening of disciples, some the awakening of a self-awakened one, and some complete and supreme awakening. Some attained the stage of warmth, some the stage of the summit, and some the stage of patient conformity to the truth. Some actualized the fruit of stream-entry, some the fruit of a once-returner, and some the fruit of a never-returner. Some actualized the state of an arhat, having abandoned all the defilements. And most of the audience became absorbed in the Buddha, devoted to the Dharma, and inclined to the community.</p>
<p>Devout brahmins and householders held a festival at that place. After that, the place was known as “Toyikā, where they have a festival.”</p>
<p>X. Śrāvastī</p>
<p>A. A Leprous Beggar Woman’s Offering of Water Used for Boiling Rice</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived in Śrāvastī and stayed in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. When the householder Anāthapiṇḍada heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, had arrived in Śrāvastī and was staying in his own park near Śrāvastī, he went to the Blessed One, and upon his arrival he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s, and then he sat down to one side. After he had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed,  inspired, encouraged, . . . the householder Anāthapiṇḍada. When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent.  Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍada rose from his seat . . . made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” He . . . prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger: “O Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.”</p>
<p>The householder ordered a doorkeeper, “Sir, do not let non-Buddhist ascetics enter the house until the community of monks headed by the Buddha has finished the meal. After that, I will give a meal to the non-Buddhist ascetics.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Master,” replied the doorkeeper to the householder Anāthapiṇḍada.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went . . . surrounded by a group of monks, and followed by the community of monks . . . . Knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma.</p>
<p>Then the venerable Mahākāśyapa came to the Jetavana from a certain dwelling place in the wilderness, with long hair and beard and in his shabby robes. When he saw the Jetavana, there was no one there. He asked a monk who was responsible for monastic property, “Where is the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>The monk told him, “They have been invited by the householder Anāthapiṇḍada.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahākāśyapa thought, “I will eat almsfood there and serve the community of monks headed by the Buddha.”</p>
<p>When he went to the house of the householder Anāthapiṇḍada, the doorkeeper said, “O noble one, please do not enter the house.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The householder Anāthapiṇḍada ordered me, ‘Do not let non-Buddhist ascetics enter the house until the community of monks headed by the Buddha has finished the meal. After that, I will give a meal to the non-Buddhist ascetics.’ ”</p>
<p>“I have attained a great boon,” thought the venerable Mahākāśyapa, “for the brahmins and householders do not know me to be a śramaṇa who is a son of the Śākyans. I will go and practice compassion for poor people.” With this thought, he went to a park and asked himself, “Whom should I accept as a follower today?”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, he approached a leprous beggar woman who was wandering and begging, and from whose body pus and blood were oozing. She had obtained by begging water that had been used for boiling rice. She saw the venerable Mahākāśyapa, whose body was beautiful, whose mind was pure, and whose behavior was calm, and thought, “I have certainly not performed any service for such a one worthy of veneration in the past; because of that, I am now in this circumstance. If the noble one Mahākāśyapa accepts out of compassion for me this water that had been used for boiling rice, I will offer it to him.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahākāśyapa knew her thoughts and held out his bowl, saying, “Sister, if you will give it to me, please pour it into this bowl.” Then her mind was filled with faith. When she poured the water into the bowl, a bee fell into it. She tried to remove it, but then one of her fingers broke off and fell into the water that had been used for boiling rice. She thought, “Even though the noble one, concerned about my feelings, may not throw it out, he will not consume it.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahākāśyapa, knowing her thoughts,  went to a wall in front of her, sat down by the wall, and ate. She thought, “Although the noble one, concerned about my feelings, has eaten some of the food, it will not serve as a meal.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahākāśyapa, knowing her thoughts, said to the beggar woman, “Rejoice, sister. I will live for a whole day and night with this meal given by you.”</p>
<p>She rejoiced greatly, thinking, “I offered almsfood to the noble one Mahākāśyapa, and he accepted it!” She died, her mind filled with faith in the venerable Mahākāśyapa, and was reborn among the gods of Tuṣita.</p>
<p>Śakra, Lord of the Gods, saw her offer water that had been used for boiling rice, gain faith, and die, but he did not see where she was reborn, even though he tried to find her among the beings of hell, the animals, the hungry ghosts, the humans, the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, and the Thirty-Three Gods. Thus, the knowledge of gods works downward, not upward.</p>
<p>Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he asked the Blessed One a question, singing it in verse:</p>
<p>“Where is the woman rejoicing,</p>
<p>Who offered water used for boiling rice to Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>When Kāśyapa, the one of great nature,</p>
<p>Was going around begging?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One answered:</p>
<p>“Those gods called Tuṣita</p>
<p>Are rich in every object of desire.</p>
<p>The woman who offered water used for boiling rice to Kāśyapa</p>
<p>Is rejoicing there.”</p>
<p>Śakra, Lord of the Gods, then thought, “These humans give donations and make merit, even though they do not understand merit. Why should I, who does understand merit and am now enjoying the fruit of my merit, not give donations and make merit?  Since this noble one Mahākāśyapa is compassionate toward those who are wretched, helpless, poor, and destitute, I will now offer almsfood to him.”</p>
<p>He produced a solitary, tumbledown, very shabby house in a village of the poor, and he himself changed into a shaggy-haired weaver in a hempen garment, whose limbs were covered with cuts, and began to weave cloth. Śacī, a goddess, dressed as the wife of the weaver and began to weave, throwing the shuttle. Divine food was prepared by his side.</p>
<p>Then, being compassionate toward those who are wretched, helpless, and destitute, the venerable Mahākāśyapa arrived in due course at the house. When he stood at the door holding his bowl, thinking that it was a suffering man, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, filled the bowl with divine food. The venerable Mahākāśyapa then thought:</p>
<p>“The meal of this man is divine nectar,</p>
<p>Whereas his house is this humble in size.</p>
<p>With the thought that this was a great contradiction,</p>
<p>Doubt has arisen in my mind.”</p>
<p>It is natural that the knowledge of arhats does not function when they are not particularly attentive. When he focused his attention, he saw that the man was Śakra, Lord of the Gods, and said, “O Kauśika, the arrows of your longtime uncertainty and doubt have been uprooted by the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, so why do you interfere with suffering people?”</p>
<p>“O noble one Mahākāśyapa, why do I interfere with suffering people? These humans give donations and make merit, even though they do not understand merit. I do understand merit and am now enjoying the fruit of my merit; why should I not give donations and make merit?  Did the Blessed One not say this:</p>
<p>“ ‘You should make merit;</p>
<p>Having not made merit, you will suffer.</p>
<p>Those who have made merit</p>
<p>Will rejoice in this world and the next.’ ”</p>
<p>Thereafter the venerable Mahākāśyapa was attentive whenever he entered a house for alms. At that time, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, remaining in the air, filled the venerable Mahākāśyapa’s bowl with divine food. The venerable Mahākāśyapa turned the bowl upside down, whereupon the food and drink were wasted. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “On account of that, I authorize you to have a cover for a bowl.”</p>
<p>Then there was a loud shout: “The beggar woman So-and-so offered water that had been used for boiling rice to the noble one Mahākāśyapa, and she was reborn among the gods of Tuṣita!”</p>
<p>B. The Offerings by King Prasenajit</p>
<p>When King Prasenajit of Kosala heard that the beggar woman So-and-so had offered water that had been used for boiling rice to the noble one Mahākāśyapa and had been reborn among the gods of Tuṣita, he went to the Blessed One. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When King Prasenajit of Kosala had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, . . . him. After he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One assent to my offer of a meal for seven days, in the name of the noble one Mahākāśyapa.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to King Prasenajit of Kosala by remaining silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and departed from his presence. Thereupon King Prasenajit of Kosala prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Blessed One know the time by messenger . . . with his own hands he served and satisfied them . . . .</p>
<p>A certain beggar was sitting in the elder’s seat. His mind was filled with faith when he thought, “Understanding merit and enjoying the fruit of his merit, this king gives donations and makes merit, not content with the merit there is.”</p>
<p>King Prasenajit of Kosala, with his own hands, served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with a pure and fine meal. Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One said, “Great King, to whose name shall I assign the rewards of the offerings, yours or that of someone who has made greater merit than you?”</p>
<p>The king thought, “The Blessed One has accepted the almsfood from me. Who, then, has made greater merit than I?” He said, “O Blessed One, may the Blessed One assign the rewards of the offerings to the name of someone who has made greater merit than I.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then assigned the rewards of the offerings to the name of the beggar.  He did this for six days. On the sixth day, the king was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, thinking, “The Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to the name of a beggar, though he had accepted the almsfood from me.”</p>
<p>The ministers saw him and asked, “Your Majesty, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” replied the king, “the Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to the name of a beggar, though he had accepted the almsfood from me. How can I help being plunged into grief?”</p>
<p>Then an old minister said, “Your Majesty, do not worry. We will somehow arrange it so that tomorrow the Blessed One will assign the rewards of the offerings to the name of Your Majesty only.” He then instructed the laborers, “Tomorrow you should prepare finer food, so that half of the distributed food will enter the monks’ bowls and the other half will fall on the ground somehow.”</p>
<p>The next day they prepared finer food. Then, knowing that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, they began to serve them, placing half of the food into the monks’ bowls and letting the other half fall on the ground. The beggar rushed to gather the food that had fallen on the ground, but the waiters blocked him. Then the beggar said, “If this king has much treasure, why does he not give it to suffering, begging people like us? What is the use of this wasted food?” His mind being disturbed, the beggar was not able to maintain his mind filled with faith as before.</p>
<p>When the community of monks headed by the Buddha had finished the meal, the king went home without hearing the rewards of the offerings assigned, thinking, “The Blessed One will not assign the rewards of the offerings to my name.”  But the Blessed One did assign the rewards of the offerings to the name of King Prasenajit of Kosala, saying:</p>
<p>“See, it is by the power</p>
<p>Of rough, saltless gruel</p>
<p>That he rules the city and country,</p>
<p>Going around with elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry.”</p>
<p>C. The Former Life of King Prasenajit</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, although the Blessed One has had meals at the palace of King Prasenajit of Kosala many times and assigned the rewards of the offerings, I have never heard him assign the rewards of the offerings in such a way in the past.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” replied the Blessed One, “do you want to hear about the karmic bond related to King Prasenajit of Kosala’s saltless gruel?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, it is the right time. Sugata, it is the right time. If the Blessed One reveals the karmic bond related to King Prasenajit of Kosala’s saltless gruel, the monks will listen to it and grasp it.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, there once lived a householder in a certain hamlet. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and his wife played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a boy who was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold was born . . . and raised, and he grew up.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the householder said to his wife, ‘Good lady, since a son who will bring us debts and deprive us of our property has been born to us, I will go abroad bearing merchandise.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, please do so,’ she replied.</p>
<p>“He went abroad bearing merchandise, and, unfortunately, died there. Since his possessions were modest, his domestic property ran out, and his son suffered poverty. A friend of the householder  said to him, ‘Son, work in my fields, and I will provide you with food.’</p>
<p>“The son began to work in the man’s field, and the man provided him with food.</p>
<p>“Then, one day there was a festival. The boy’s mother thought, ‘Today the householder’s wife will be busy giving a meal to her friends, kinsmen, relatives, śramaṇas, and young brahmins. So I will go to her in advance to get my son’s meal.’</p>
<p>“She went in advance to the wife of the householder and asked her for a meal. The wife became angry and said, ‘Why should I give a meal to a servant boy when I have not yet even given it to śramaṇas, brahmins, and relatives? Wait all day; I will give you a double portion tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“Then the boy’s mother thought, ‘Perhaps my son has become hungry; I will take him this saltless wheat gruel of mine.’</p>
<p>“She then took it to the field. The boy saw her from a place nearby and asked, ‘Mother, is there not anything tasty?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son,’ she said, ‘we do not have even an ordinary meal today.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why, mother?’</p>
<p>“She explained to her son in detail all that the householder’s wife had said, and told him, ‘I brought this saltless wheat gruel. Son, please eat it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Just leave it,’ he replied. She left it and departed.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear, there appear self-awakened ones as the only ones worthy of veneration in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with places to sit on the outskirts of towns.</p>
<p>“At that time, a certain self-awakened one arrived at that place. The boy saw him whose body was beautiful, whose mind was pure, and whose behavior was calm, and thought, ‘Certainly I have not performed any service for such a one so worthy of veneration in the past; because of that, I am now in this circumstance. If he accepts this saltless gruel from me, I will offer it to him.’</p>
<p>“The self-awakened one knew the poor man’s thoughts  and held out his bowl, saying, ‘Sir, if you will give it to me, please pour it into this bowl.’ Then, out of strong faith, the boy offered the saltless gruel to the self-awakened one.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the poor boy at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this King Prasenajit of Kosala. Because of that karma, namely, his offering the saltless gruel to the self-awakened one at that time, on that occasion, he ruled over the kingdom of the Thirty-Three Gods six times. In this Śrāvastī, too, he has been an anointed kṣatriya king six times. And because of the remains of that karma, he became an anointed kṣatriya king in this life, too. Alluding to the maturation of the karma in which his offering of gruel was completed, I said:</p>
<p>“See, it is by the power</p>
<p>Of rough, saltless gruel</p>
<p>That he rules the city and country,</p>
<p>Going around with elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry.”</p>
<p>Then there was a loud shout: “The Blessed One has revealed the karmic bond related to King Prasenajit of Kosala’s saltless gruel!”</p>
<p>Having heard this, King Prasenajit of Kosala went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When the king had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma . . . . When he had . . . delighted him . . . , the Blessed One remained silent. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, for three months.” The Blessed One assented to King Prasenajit of Kosala by remaining silent. Thereupon King Prasenajit of Kosala began to provide the community of monks headed by the Buddha with meals of a hundred flavors, dress each monk with clothes worth a hundred thousand ordinary clothes, and offer rows of lamps, having gathered ten million bottles of oil, for three months. At the time of meals and offerings it was very loud and noisy.</p>
<p>D. The Offering of a Lamp by a Beggar Woman</p>
<p>Thereupon a certain beggar woman who was long suffering entered the city for alms, carrying a broken oil-vessel. When she heard that loud, noisy cry, she asked others, “Sirs, what is this loud, noisy cry?”</p>
<p>People told her, “King Prasenajit of Kosala has begun to provide the community of monks headed by the Buddha with meals of a hundred flavors, dress each monk with clothes worth a hundred thousand ordinary clothes, and offer rows of lamps, having gathered ten million bottles of oil, for three months.”</p>
<p>The beggar woman thought, “Not content with his other merits, this King Prasenajit of Kosala still makes donations and makes merit today. Now I too will beg for oil from someone and offer a lamp to the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Having begged and obtained a little oil, she poured it into the vessel and offered a lamp to the Blessed One’s walking path. Throwing herself at the foot of the walking path, she made this aspiration: “By this root of merit, may I become a teacher named Śākyamuni when people’s lifespans are a hundred years long, just as this teacher, the Blessed One Śākyamuni, appeared when people’s lifespans were a hundred years long. And just as his two best and wisest disciples are Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, his attendant monk is Ānanda, his father is Śuddhodana, his mother is Queen Mahāmāyā, his son is Prince Rāhulabhadra, and his city is Kapilavastu, so too may my two best and wisest disciples  be Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, my attendant monk be Ānanda, my father be Śuddhodana, my mother be Queen Mahāmāyā, my son be Prince Rāhulabhadra, and my city be Kapilavastu. And just as this blessed one will be completely emancipated, having his bones distributed, so too may I be completely emancipated, having my bones distributed.”</p>
<p>At that time all the other lamps went out, and only the lamp she had lit remained burning.</p>
<p>It is natural that until the buddhas, the blessed ones, retire, the attendants of the buddhas, the blessed ones, do not retire. The venerable Ānanda thought, “It is impossible, out of the question, for the buddhas, the blessed ones, to go to bed in a bright place. I will now extinguish the lamp.”</p>
<p>He tried to extinguish the lamp by hand, but in vain. Then he tried with the hem of his garment, and then with a fan, but he still was not able to extinguish the lamp. The Blessed One asked the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One,” he answered, “I thought, ‘It is impossible, out of the question, for the buddhas, the blessed ones, to go to bed in a bright place. I will now extinguish the lamp.’ I tried to extinguish the lamp by hand, but in vain. Then I tried with the hem of my garment, and then with a fan, but it still was in vain.”</p>
<p>“Ānanda,” said the Blessed One, “do not waste your effort. Even if a violent storm arose, it could not extinguish that lamp, let alone a hand, the hem of a garment, or a fan. That lamp was lit by this girl with a great resolution. Ānanda, this girl will become a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one named Śākyamuni when people’s lifespans are a hundred years long,  and his two best and wisest disciples will be Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, his attendant monk Ānanda, his father Śuddhodana, his mother Queen Mahāmāyā, his son Prince Rāhulabhadra, and his city Kapilavastu. And he will be completely emancipated, having his bones distributed.”</p>
<p>There was then a loud shout: “Since the beggar woman So-and-so offered a lamp to the place for the Blessed One’s walking, the Blessed One predicted her supreme and complete awakening!” Having heard this, devout brahmins and householders offered her all the requisites, thinking about her future merit.</p>
<p>E. The Question of King Prasenajit: The Offerings Made by the Buddha in His Former Lives</p>
<p>Having heard this, and prompted by curiosity, King Prasenajit of Kosala prepared a thousand oil vessels, arranged various lamps, and lit lamps made from four different-colored precious materials at the walking path. Then he went to the Blessed One and said, “O Honored One, I invited the Blessed One for seven days for the purpose of veneration of the noble one Mahākāśyapa, and the Blessed One revealed the karmic bond related to my saltless gruel in the past. Further, I have offered meals to the Blessed One together with the community of disciples for three months, dressed each monk with clothes worth a hundred thousand ordinary clothes, and offered rows of lamps, having gathered ten million bottles of oil. But the Blessed One has not predicted my supreme and complete awakening. If I am going to become the best in the world, the leader, too, it would be nice if the Blessed One would predict my supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>“Great King,” replied the Blessed One, “supreme and complete awakening is profound. It appears profound, it is hard to see  or know, it is inconceivable, it is not the object of words, but subtle, and it is to be known only by those of keen perception, the wise, the learned. It is not attained by one donation or a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand donations of yours. But, Great King, if you wish for supreme and complete awakening, you should give donations, make merit, and serve, attend, and wait on good friends. Giving donations, making merit, and serving, attending, and waiting on good friends, you will someday become the best in the world, the leader.”</p>
<p>Being told this, King Prasenajit of Kosala burst into tears. Then King Prasenajit of Kosala wiped his tears away with the hem of his garment and asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, how many donations did the Blessed One give, and how much merit did he make, seeking supreme and complete awakening?”</p>
<p>“Great King,” replied the Blessed One, “leaving other past eons aside for now, I gave donations and made merit in various ways, seeking supreme and complete awakening in this fortunate eon. Listen to those stories well and keep them in mind; I shall teach them.”</p>

<p>1. Māndhātṛ</p>
<p>a. The Story of King Māndhātṛ</p>
<p>“Great King, once, when people’s lives were immeasurably long, there appeared a king named Upoṣadha. One day a soft, fleshy tumor developed on the crown of his head; it was exceptionally soft, just like tūla cotton or karpāsa cotton, and caused no pain.  When it had fully enlarged, it burst open and a boy emerged from it. He was well proportioned, attractive, pleasant to behold, and gold in complexion, his head like a parasol and with long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete, and his body was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man.</p>
<p>“Soon after birth, he was brought to the harem. As soon as the eighty thousand consorts of King Upoṣadha saw the prince, milk squirted out from all of their breasts, and each said, ‘Suckle at my breast (*mān dhaya)!’ Therefore, he was named Māndhātṛ. Other people said that since he had been born (jāta) from the crown of the head (mūrdhnā), the prince should be named Mūrdhnāta. There some people knew him as Māndhātṛ and others as Mūrdhnāta.</p>
<p>“While Prince Māndhātṛ was playing princely games, six successive Śakras died. While he was in the position of crown prince, another six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“One day Prince Māndhātṛ went to the countryside. After he had gone to the countryside, King Upoṣadha became sick. Although he was provided with medicines derived from roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits, the illness just kept on getting worse. He ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, anoint the prince as king quickly.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“The ministers sent a messenger, saying, ‘King Upoṣadha has become sick. He said, “Call the prince and let him accept the royal anointing.” Hence the prince should come quickly.’ When the messenger had departed, King Upoṣadha died. Then the ministers sent another messenger, saying, ‘O Prince, your father has passed away. Please come and accept the kingdom.’</p>
<p>“Prince Māndhātṛ stayed there, thinking, ‘Since my father has passed away, what use is there in my going there?’ The ministers again met together and sent a minister as a messenger.  He went to the prince and requested, ‘O Prince, please accept the kingdom.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I obtain the kingdom according to the Dharma,’ replied the prince, ‘the royal anointing will take place here.’</p>
<p>“The ministers sent a message: ‘Your Majesty, the royal anointing requires many things. We perform the royal anointing in the palace on a jeweled floor with a throne, parasol, crown, and bracelet. Therefore, the prince must come to this very place.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I obtain the kingdom according to the Dharma,’ replied the prince, ‘everything necessary will appear here.’</p>
<p>“A yakṣa named Divaukasa, attendant on Prince Māndhātṛ, brought there a jeweled floor and throne. People living in the palace then spontaneously came together, bringing a parasol, crown, and bracelet. Since the people living in the palace spontaneously (svayaṃ) came (āgata), the place was named Sāketā.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the ministers, army, citizens, and provincial dwellers also brought there the water for the royal anointing. They said, ‘Your Majesty, please accept the royal anointing.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Am I being crowned by humans?’ he replied. ‘If I obtain the kingdom according to the Dharma, I will be crowned by nonhumans.’</p>
<p>“Thus, he was crowned by nonhumans, and his seven treasures appeared: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He had a thousand sons who were brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who would defeat the enemy’s army.</p>
<p>“There were comfortable woods near Vaiśālī, and there lived five hundred ṛṣis who had the five kinds of supernormal knowledge. There lived many birds in the woods, too. Since dhyāna is disturbed  by voices, when the birds in flight made a sound, a ṛṣi named Durmukha became angry and cursed them: ‘May your wings be broken!’ Their wings did break on account of the angry ṛṣi, and so they began to walk.</p>
<p>“When the king was traveling through the country, he saw the birds walking and asked his ministers, ‘Why are these birds walking?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, since dhyāna is disturbed by voices, angry ṛṣis cursed the birds, and so their wings broke on account of the angry ṛṣis.’</p>
<p>“ ‘There seem to be such ṛṣis who are not compassionate toward beings,’ the king remarked, and then he ordered, ‘Sirs, command the ṛṣis today not to live in my land.’</p>
<p>“The ministers went to the ṛṣis and conveyed the order: ‘It was uttered from His Majesty’s lips: “You must not live in my land.” ’</p>
<p>“The ṛṣis thought, ‘Since this king is the ruler of the four continents, let us go to the terrace of Mount Sumeru.’ They went there and settled in.</p>
<p>“King Māndhātṛ’s people were thinkers, measurers, and investigators. Thinking and investigating, they exerted themselves in their respective arts and technical skills. Since they were thinkers, measurers, and investigators, they were named ‘born from thought’ (manuja, ‘human being’).</p>
<p>“They began to work in the fields. When the king was traveling through the country, he saw the people working in the fields, and he asked his ministers, ‘What are these people doing?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied the ministers, ‘they are growing grains and so on in order to make medicine from them.’</p>
<p>“The king wondered, ‘Why do the people in my land have to work in the fields?’  Then he said, ‘The gods should cause a rain of twenty-seven kinds of seeds.’</p>
<p>“As soon as King Māndhātṛ had wished this, the gods did cause a rain of twenty-seven kinds of seeds. King Māndhātṛ asked his provincial dwellers, ‘Whose merit caused these?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Both Your Majesty’s and ours did,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Then, the people began to plow the cotton fields. Again, when King Māndhātṛ was traveling through the country, he saw them and asked his ministers, ‘What are these people doing?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, these people are plowing the cotton fields,’ the ministers replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘What need is there?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they explained, ‘they do this in order to make clothes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do the people in my land have to plow the cotton fields?’ King Māndhātṛ wondered. ‘The gods should cause a rain of cotton.’</p>
<p>“As soon as King Māndhātṛ had thought this, the gods did cause a rain of cotton seeds. King Māndhātṛ asked his provincial dwellers, ‘Whose merit caused these?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Both Your Majesty’s and ours did,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Then, these people began to spin the cotton, and the king asked, ‘What are these people doing?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, they are spinning cotton into thread,’ said the ministers.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do the people in my land have to spin cotton into thread?’ the king wondered. ‘The gods should cause a rain of cotton threads.’</p>
<p>“As soon as King Māndhātṛ had thought this, the gods did cause a rain of cotton threads. The king asked, ‘Whose merit caused these?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Both Your Majesty’s and ours did,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“After that, they began in due course to weave the cotton. The king asked, ‘What are they doing?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they said, ‘they are weaving cotton into cloth.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do the people in my land have to weave cotton into cloth?’ King Māndhātṛ wondered.  ‘The gods should cause a rain of cotton cloth.’</p>
<p>“As soon as King Māndhātṛ had thought this, the gods did cause a rain of cotton cloth. The king asked, ‘Whose merit caused these?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Both Your Majesty’s and ours did,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“The king thought, ‘These people do not realize the power of my merits. I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physique, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. Now, may a rain of jewels fall in my palace, but not even a kārṣāpaṇa outside!’</p>
<p>“As soon as King Māndhātṛ had thought this, a rain of jewels did fall in the palace for seven days, but not even a kārṣāpaṇa fell outside. It looked like someone possessing great dignity and great magical power, having made merit and performed good deeds, was enjoying the fruit of his merit. The king asked, ‘Whose merit caused these?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty’s did,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“The king said, ‘Sirs, you are wrong. If you had first said, “Your Majesty’s merit did,” I would have caused a rain of jewels throughout the continent of Jambu. But whoever wants jewels among you can take as many jewels as he wants.’</p>
<p>“After that, while King Māndhātṛ was ruling over the great kingdom, six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“The king asked the yakṣa named Divaukasa, attendant on Māndhātṛ, ‘Is there any other continent where they do not obey my orders?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,” Divaukasa answered, ‘there is a continent called Videha in the east,  which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. May Your Majesty go to that continent and rule it.’</p>
<p>“Then King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. Also, a rain of jewels fell in my palace for seven days. But it is said that there is another continent, which is called Videha in the east. I will now go to that continent and rule over it.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he had thought this, King Māndhātṛ flew with an army of eight trillion up into the sky, surrounded by his thousand sons and preceded by his seven treasures. King Māndhātṛ went to Videha in the east and lived there. Like a being possessing great dignity and great magical power, having made merit and performed good deeds, enjoying the fruit of his merit, King Māndhātṛ ruled over the continent of Videha in the east for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. While he was ruling over the continent of Videha in the east, six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“Again, King Māndhātṛ asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Is there any other continent where they do not obey my orders?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ Divaukasa answered, ‘there is a continent called Godānīya in the west, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. May Your Majesty go to that continent and rule it.’</p>
<p>“Then King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. Also, a rain of jewels fell in my palace for seven days. I went to the continent of Videha in the east, too. I ruled over the continent of Videha in the east for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. But it is said that there is another continent, which is called Godānīya in the west. I will now go to that continent and rule over it.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he had thought this, King Māndhātṛ flew with an army of eight trillion up into the sky, surrounded by his thousand sons and preceded by his seven treasures. King Māndhātṛ went to Godānīya in the west and lived there. Like a being possessing great dignity and great magical power, having made merit and performed good deeds, enjoying the fruit of his merit, King Māndhātṛ ruled over the continent of Godānīya in the west for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. While he was ruling over the continent of Godānīya in the west, six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“Again, King Māndhātṛ asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Is there any other continent where they do not obey my orders?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ Divaukasa answered, ‘there is a continent called Kuru in the north, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. Moreover, these people are free from both attachment and acquisitiveness. May Your Majesty go to that continent and there command your army!’</p>
<p>“Then  King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘‘I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. Also, a rain of jewels fell in my palace for seven days. I went to the continent of Videha in the east, too. I ruled over the continent of Videha in the east for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. I went to the continent of Godānīya in the west, too. I ruled over the continent of Godānīya in the west for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. But it is said that there is another continent, called Kuru in the north, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. Moreover, these people are free from both attachment and acquisitiveness. I will now go to that continent and there command my army.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he had thought this, King Māndhātṛ flew with an army of eight trillion up into the sky, surrounded by his thousand sons and preceded by his seven treasures.</p>
<p>“When King Māndhātṛ saw a white place beside Mount Sumeru, he asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Divaukasa, what is that white place?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, those are grains of rice of the people of Kuru in the north, which does not need plowing or sowing. Thus, the people of Kuru in the north enjoy rice that does not need plowing or sowing. Go there, Your Majesty, and you will enjoy such a kind of rice, too.’</p>
<p>“When he had heard this, King Māndhātṛ said to his ministers, ‘Leaders, do you see that white place?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, we do, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Leaders, those are grains of rice of the people of Kuru in the north, which does not need plowing or sowing. Thus, the people of Kuru in the north enjoy rice that does not need plowing or sowing. Go there and you will enjoy such a kind of rice, too.’</p>
<p>“When King Māndhātṛ proceeded, he also saw from a distance very beautiful trees like a row of garlands beside Mount Sumeru. Having seen them, he again asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Divaukasa, what are those very beautiful trees like a row of garlands?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, those are the wish-fulfilling trees of the people of Kuru in the north. Thus, the people of Kuru in the north wear clothes produced by the wish-fulfilling trees.</p>
<p>“Having heard this, King Māndhātṛ said to his ministers, ‘Leaders, do you see those very beautiful trees like a row of garlands?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, we do, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Leaders, those are the wish-fulfilling trees of the people of Kuru in the north. Thus, the people of Kuru in the north wear clothes produced by the wish-fulfilling trees. Go there and you will wear the clothes produced by the wish-fulfilling trees, too.’</p>
<p>“King Māndhātṛ then went to Kuru in the north and lived there. Like a being possessing great dignity and great magical power, having made merit and performed good deeds, enjoying the fruit of his merit, King Māndhātṛ commanded his army in the continent of Kuru in the north for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“Again, King Māndhātṛ asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘‘Is there any other continent where they do not obey my orders?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No, Your Majesty, there is not. But the Thirty-Three Gods enjoy long lives, excellent figures, and much happiness, and they live in a high heavenly palace for a long time. Your Majesty should now go to see the Thirty-Three Gods!’</p>
<p>“The king thought, ‘I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. Also, a rain of jewels fell in my palace for seven days. I went to the continent of Videha in the east, too. I ruled over the continent of Videha in the east for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. I went to the continent of Godānīya in the west, too. I ruled over the continent of Godānīya in the west for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. I went to the continent of Kuru in the north, too. I commanded my army in the continent of Kuru in the north for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. But it is said that the Thirty-Three Gods enjoy long lives, excellent figures, and much happiness, and they live in a high heavenly palace for a long time. I will now go to see the Thirty-Three Gods.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he had thought this, King Māndhātṛ flew with an army of eight trillion  up into the sky, surrounded by his thousand sons and preceded by his seven treasures.</p>
<p>“Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, is surrounded by seven golden mountains. King Māndhātṛ stayed on golden Mount Nimindhara. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Nimindhara to golden Mount Vinataka and stayed there. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Vinataka to golden Mount Aśvakarṇa. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Aśvakarṇa to golden Mount Sudarśana. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Sudarśana to golden Mount Khadiraka. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Khadiraka to golden Mount Īṣādhāra. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died. He then went from Mount Īṣādhāra to golden Mount Yugandhara. While he was commanding his army there, six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>A Section Index:</p>
<p>Nimindhara, Vinataka,</p>
<p>Likewise Aśvakarṇa,</p>
<p>Sudarśana, Khadiraka,</p>
<p>Īṣādhāra, and Yugandhara.</p>
<p>“He then flew up into the sky from Mount Yugandhara and departed. The five hundred ṛṣis were living on the terrace of Mount Sumeru. They saw the king coming and said, ‘Sirs, that quarrelsome king is coming.’</p>
<p>“Then the ṛṣi named Durmukha scooped up water with his hands and scattered it so that the army was blocked. The most treasured minister went before him and said to the ṛṣis:</p>
<p>“ ‘O brahmin, free yourself from anger;</p>
<p>It will never be completed in anything.</p>
<p>This is Māndhātṛ, the master of people;</p>
<p>It’s not those birds.’</p>
<p>“Then, having arrived at that place, King Māndhātṛ demanded, ‘Who has blocked this army?’</p>
<p>“ ‘The ṛṣis have,’ answered the most treasured minister.</p>
<p>“ ‘What do these ṛṣis most cherish?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied the minister, ‘they most cherish their locks of hair.’</p>
<p>“The king said, ‘May these people have their locks of hair fall out and become my attendants.’ The locks of their hair then did fall out, and they began to run before the king, holding bows and arrows in their hands.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ said the most treasured woman to the king, ‘these ṛṣis are ascetics; what use are they? Please release them.’</p>
<p>“When the king had released them, they recovered their vigor and actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge again. King Māndhātṛ again flew up into the sky together with his army.</p>
<p>“Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, touches the golden ground eighty thousand yojanas below sea level; another eighty thousand yojanas appear above the water. Thus, the mountain is one hundred sixty thousand yojanas in total. Each side of it is eighty thousand yojanas long, and thus the mountain is three hundred twenty thousand yojanas in circumference. Consisting of four kinds of precious substances, it is excellent, beautiful, and pleasant to behold. The Thirty-Three Gods live on its summit. Their five kinds of guards are deployed there, namely, aquatic nāgas, karoṭapāṇi yakṣas, mālādhāras, sadāmattas, and the Four Great Kings.</p>
<p>“When the aquatic nāgas blocked King Māndhātṛ’s army, King Māndhātṛ arrived at that place and asked, ‘Who has blocked this army?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Aquatic nāgas have,’ the members of the army answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Am I fighting animals?’ wondered the king.  “Then he said, ‘May these aquatic nāgas become my attendants.’</p>
<p>“They began to go before King Māndhātṛ, and then these nāgas arrived where the karoṭapāṇi gods were. The gods asked them, ‘Sirs, why are you going?’</p>
<p>“ ‘A human king is coming here,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Then the nāgas and karoṭapāṇi gods turned back and blocked the army again. King Māndhātṛ came and asked, ‘Who has blocked this army?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, these karoṭapāṇi gods have blocked the army,’ the members of the army answered.</p>
<p>“King Māndhātṛ said, ‘May these karoṭapāṇi gods become my attendants.’</p>
<p>“Then they began to run before King Māndhātṛ with the nāgas, and they arrived where the mālādhāra gods were. Those gods asked them, ‘Sirs, why are you running?’</p>
<p>“ ‘A human king is coming here,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Then the gods and nāgas turned back and blocked the army again. The king arrived at that place and asked, ‘Who has blocked this army?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, the mālādhāra gods have,’ the members of the army answered.</p>
<p>“The king said, ‘May these mālādhāra gods become my attendants.’</p>
<p>“Then they began to run before him, and they arrived where the sadāmatta gods were. Those gods asked them, ‘Sirs, why are you running?’</p>
<p>“ ‘A human king is coming here,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“Then they turned back and blocked the army again. The king arrived at that place and asked, ‘Who has blocked this army?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, the sadāmatta gods have,’ the members of the army answered.</p>
<p>“The king  said, ‘May these sadāmatta gods become my attendants.’</p>
<p>“Then they began to run before him, and went to the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings. Those gods asked them, ‘Sirs, why are you running?’</p>
<p>“ ‘A human king is coming here.’</p>
<p>“The Four Great Kings thought, ‘This being seems to have the great power of merit. We cannot block them.’</p>
<p>“Then the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings informed the Thirty-Three Gods, ‘A human king is coming here.’ The Thirty-Three Gods thought, ‘Since this being seems to have the great power of merit, we should not obstruct him but welcome him with offerings.’ Then the Thirty-Three Gods did welcome him with offerings.</p>
<p>“When King Māndhātṛ stood at the summit of Mount Sumeru, he saw a green chain of forests like billowing clouds and asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Divaukasa, what is that green chain of forests like billowing clouds?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, that is the forest of the Thirty-Three Gods’ kovidāra trees, whose name is Pāriyātraka. The Thirty-Three Gods play, amuse themselves, and enjoy themselves there for the four months of the rainy season, obtaining and owning the divine objects of the five kinds of desires. Your Majesty should go there and play, amuse himself, and enjoy himself, possessing and owning the divine objects of the five kinds of desires, too.’</p>
<p>“Having heard this, King Māndhātṛ asked the ministers, ‘Leaders, do you see that green chain of forests like billowing clouds?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, we do, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Leaders, that is the Thirty-Three Gods’ kovidāra tree, whose name is Pāriyātraka. The Thirty-Three Gods play, amuse themselves, and enjoy themselves there for the four months of the rainy season, obtaining and owning the divine objects of the five kinds of desires.  Leaders, you should go there and play, amuse yourselves, and enjoy yourselves, obtaining and owning the divine objects of the five kinds of desires, too.’</p>
<p>“Again, on the summit of Mount Sumeru, after King Māndhātṛ saw a high, white object resembling billowing clouds, he asked the yakṣa Divaukasa, ‘Divaukasa, what is that high, white object resembling billowing clouds?’</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, that is the Thirty-Three Gods’ meeting hall, Sudharmā. The Thirty-Three Gods and the Four Great Kings meet together there and think, measure, and investigate divine and human matters. Your Majesty will go there, too.’</p>
<p>“Having heard this, King Māndhātṛ asked the ministers, ‘Leaders, do you see that high, white object resembling billowing clouds?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, we do, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Leaders, that is the Thirty-Three Gods’ meeting hall, Sudharmā. The Thirty-Three Gods and the Four Great Kings meet together there and think, measure, and investigate divine and human matters. Leaders, you will go there, too.’</p>
<p>“The Thirty-Three Gods’ city, Sudarśana, is two thousand five hundred yojanas in length and width, and thus ten thousand yojanas in circumference. It is surrounded by seven golden walls, and each wall is three and a half yojanas high. On each wall, there are four towers made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal. The walls are also provided with upward-facing and downward-facing windows. The ground in the city of Sudarśana is excellent,  beautiful, pleasant to behold, variegated—exceptionally variegated, and colored in a hundred and one hues. It is soft, exceptionally soft like tūla cotton or karpāsa cotton: it yields when one steps on it, and rises when one raises one’s foot. Divine mandārava flowers cover the ground to such a height that one sinks in them to the knees. When the wind rises, it clears the old flowers away and causes new flowers to fall. There are nine hundred ninety-nine gates in the city of Sudarśana, and at each gate there are five hundred yakṣas in blue garments and armor, holding bows and arrows, and thus they protect, guard, and adorn the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>
<p>“The streets in the city of Sudarśana are two thousand five hundred yojanas long and twelve yojanas wide. They are excellent, beautiful and pleasant to behold, spread with golden sand, sprinkled with sandalwood water, and covered with golden lattices. There are various ponds throughout the city. These ponds are surrounded by four kinds of bricks made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal. The ponds are also provided with stairs made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal, and the ponds are surrounded by parapets made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal. The nails, rails, and bases of the gold parapets are made of silver; those of the silver parapets are made of gold; those of the lapis lazuli parapets are made of crystal; and those of the crystal parapets  are made of lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>“These ponds are filled with water that is honey-sweet and cool, covered with utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers. There, various aquatic birds that assume any shape at will sing in melodious, beautiful, and pleasing voices. Everywhere around these ponds, trees bearing blossoms, trees bearing fruits, and trees bearing diadems grow in a very lovely manner, just like garlands skillfully made as earrings by a skilled garland maker or pupil of a garland maker. Various terrestrial birds that assume any shape at will sing in melodious and beautiful voices, too.</p>
<p>“In the city of Sudarśana, wish-fulfilling trees of four kinds of cloth, namely, blue, yellow, red, and white, produce four kinds of clothes of these colors, respectively. Gods and goddesses obtain at once exactly what they want from these trees.</p>
<p>“Four kinds of ornament trees produce four kinds of ornaments, namely, ornaments for the arms, ornaments for the ankles, ornaments to be worn under garments, and ornaments for display. Gods and goddesses obtain at once exactly what they want from these trees.</p>
<p>“Gods and goddesses may also obtain at once exactly what they want when they want any of the four kinds of musical instruments, namely, lutes, flutes, three-stringed lutes, and harps.</p>
<p>“Gods and goddesses may also obtain at once exactly what they want, when they want any of the four kinds of divine foods, namely, blue, yellow, red, and white.</p>
<p>“There are houses with balconies, cool rooms, terraces, windows, and skylights,  places where groups of women or groups of celestial nymphs gather. There the Thirty-Three Gods play, amuse themselves, and enjoy themselves with drinks of honey, liquor produced from honey, and liquor from kadamba blossoms, as well as various sounds of music. Thus they enjoy the fruit of their own merit.</p>
<p>“The Thirty-Three Gods’ divine meeting hall, Sudharmā, is three hundred yojanas in length and width, and nine hundred yojanas in circumference. It is excellent, beautiful, and pleasant to behold, made of crystal, and located four and a half yojanas above the city. There the Thirty-Three Gods’ seats are arranged: namely, the seats of the thirty-two brothers of Indra and the seat of Śakra, Lord of the Thirty-Three Gods. King Māndhātṛ’s seat was arranged at the very end of all these seats.</p>
<p>“The Thirty-Three Gods welcomed King Māndhātṛ with offerings. In due course, those beings who were known to have great power from the maturation of their own merits entered there; others sat down outside.</p>
<p>“King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘Certainly the last one of these arranged seats is mine.’ Then King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘Oh, I wish Śakra, Lord of the Gods, would offer half of his seat to me.’ Great King, as soon as he thought this, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, did offer half of his seat to King Māndhātṛ, and King Māndhātṛ sat down on half of the seat of Śakra, Lord of the Gods.</p>
<p>“Great King, when King Māndhātṛ and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, sat on one seat together, there was no difference, no distinction, and no contrast between them in their height, girth, perfection of figure, or  speaking, except that Śakra, Lord of the Gods, did not blink his eyes.</p>
<p>“Great King, while King Māndhātṛ was sitting among the Thirty-Three Gods, thirty-six successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“Thereupon a battle broke out there between the gods and the asuras. Whenever the asuras were defeated there, they closed the gate of their city and, after walking back and forth on the top of the wall, sat down; whenever the gods were defeated, they closed the gate of their city and, after walking back and forth on the top of the wall, sat down.</p>
<p>“Then the asuras prepared their army consisting of four divisions. Having broken through the five barriers, they advanced to attack Śakra, Lord of the Gods. The yakṣas said to Śakra, Lord of the Gods, ‘Kauśika, please be informed that the asuras are approaching, having broken through the five barriers. Please get on with your business; do what should be done.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, prepared his army consisting of four divisions and made them march against the asuras. When he saw this, King Māndhātṛ said, ‘Please stay here; I will go.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Please do so,’ replied Śakra.</p>
<p>“King Māndhātṛ then flew with an army of eight trillion up into the sky and sounded his bowstring. When they heard this, the asuras asked each other, ‘Whose bowstring is sounding?’ They heard that this was the sound of King Māndhātṛ’s bowstring, and felt wonder at this.</p>
<p>“Then King Māndhātṛ made his army proceed. It is natural that each chariot of fighting gods and asuras remains horizontally in the sky, not hovering above or below the others. But King Māndhātṛ’s chariot flew up into the sky above all the asuras  and stayed there. The asuras asked each other, ‘Who flew up into the sky above us and remains there?’</p>
<p>“When they heard that this was the human king, Māndhātṛ, they thought, ‘This being, whose chariot flies in the sky above us, is someone who is known to have great power from the maturation of his merits.’</p>
<p>“They were then defeated. Frightened and outfought, they turned their backs and retreated to the residence of the asuras.</p>
<p>“ ‘Who won?’ asked King Māndhātṛ.</p>
<p>“The ministers answered, ‘Your Majesty did.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am superior to the Thirty-Three Gods,’ thought the king.</p>
<p>“Then King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘I have the continent of Jambu, which is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. I have the continents of Videha in the east, Godānīya in the west, and Kuru in the north, too. I also have seven treasures: namely, the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. Furthermore, I have a thousand sons who are brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who will defeat the enemy’s army. A rain of jewels fell in my palace for seven days. I came to the Thirty-Three Gods, I entered the divine meeting hall, Sudharmā, and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, gave me half of his seat. Thus, I will now drive away Śakra, Lord of the Gods, from this residence, and I myself will rule all the kingdoms of gods and humans.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he thought this, Great King, King Māndhātṛ’s success ended. He alighted on the continent of Jambu,  became seriously ill, and experienced unbearable mortal pain.</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Māndhātṛ’s ministers, astrologers, chief ministers who had installed the king on the throne, and those who lived by mantras went to King Māndhātṛ. When they arrived, they asked the king, ‘If, after Your Majesty passes away, the people in the kingdom left behind ask us, “Sirs, what did King Māndhātṛ say at his last moment?” how should we answer those people who ask this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Leaders, if, after my death, the people left behind come to you and ask you this, you should answer those people, “Sirs, King Māndhātṛ is said to have passed away not content with the five objects of desire, even after having possessed the seven treasures, ruled over his kingdom in the four continents with the four kinds of human success, and even gone to the Thirty-Three Gods.” ’</p>
<p>“Then he spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Even if a rain of kārṣāpaṇas falls,</p>
<p>One would not be content with the objects of one’s desire.</p>
<p>The wise, knowing that the objects of desire</p>
<p>Provide little pleasure and much pain,</p>
<p>“ ‘Are not pleased</p>
<p>Even with divine objects of desire.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Perfectly Awakened One</p>
<p>Are pleased with the destruction of existence.</p>
<p>“ ‘Even a mountain of gold</p>
<p>Equal to the Himalaya</p>
<p>Would not be sufficient to be one’s possession.</p>
<p>Thus should be known by the wise.</p>
<p>“ ‘How could one who thus understands suffering</p>
<p>Be pleased with objects of desire?</p>
<p>Knowing that worldly wealth is painful,</p>
<p>One who is steady should learn to overcome it.’</p>
<p>“Great King, thus, in this way, you should know that few people die contented and satisfied with the objects of the five kinds of desires in the human world and that many people die discontented and unsatisfied with the objects of the five kinds of desires in the human world.</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Māndhātṛ made a limitless offering and spoke some more verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Knowing that life is short,</p>
<p>Both in this world and the next,</p>
<p>One should make merit;</p>
<p>Not having made merit, one will experience suffering.</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore, if those who wish for merit</p>
<p>Duly give donations,</p>
<p>They will be pleased in this world and the next,</p>
<p>Having given such donations.’</p>
<p>“At that time citizens and provincial dwellers heard that King Māndhātṛ had become sick and was dying. After they had heard this, hundreds of thousands of people went to see King Māndhātṛ. The king told the people about the faults of desire and also talked about the faults of living at home and about rejecting desire. After they had heard this, hundreds of thousands of people abandoned their lives at home and went forth among ṛṣis. Having sat in the forest and practiced the four pure ways of abiding, they drove away their longing for objects of desire. Having practiced in this way many times, they were reborn as inhabitants of the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“Great King, while King Māndhātṛ was playing as a child, acting as the crown prince, ruling over the great kingdom in the continent of Jambu, living in the continents of Videha in the east, Godānīya in the west, Kuru in the north, and on the seven golden mountains, and going to the residence of the Thirty-Three Gods and living there, one hundred fourteen successive Śakras died.</p>
<p>“Great King, how long is the life of Śakra, Lord of the Gods? What is a hundred years for humans is one day for the Thirty-Three Gods. Thirty of these days is a month, and twenty of these months is a year. One thousand divine years in this calculation is the lifespan of the Thirty-Three Gods, which is equal to thirty-six million human years.</p>
<p>“Great King,  the one who was Śakra at that time, on that occasion—the time when, having gone to the Thirty-Three Gods, King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘Oh, I wish Śakra, Lord of the Gods, would offer half of his seat to me’—is the monk Kāśyapa. The one who was Śakra, Lord of the Gods, at that time, on that occasion— the time when King Māndhātṛ thought, ‘I will now drive away Śakra, Lord of the Gods, from this residence, and I myself will rule the kingdoms of gods and humans’—is the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. Although the king was known as a being of immense power, he conceived an evil thought. Therefore, his success ended and he alighted on the continent of Jambu, became seriously ill, and experienced unbearable mortal pain.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Great King? That one who was King Māndhātṛ at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Although he benefited such a large number of beings, he did not attain supreme knowledge. But these acts were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>b. A Former Life of King Māndhātṛ: The Son of the Head of a Guild</p>
<p>The king, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did King Māndhātṛ create that matured to cause that golden rain that fell for seven days as soon as he thought about it?”</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past there appeared in the world a teacher named Sarvābhibhū, who was a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one.</p>
<p>“At that time there was a son of the head of a guild, who was newly married. By the custom of the region, a dowry was to be given to one’s daughter’s husband as soon as he married her;  the bride, adorned with flowers made of four kinds of jewels, was to be given to her husband; and the husband was to bring her to his house. The son of the head of a guild rode in a vehicle and departed for his house, carrying flowers made of four kinds of jewels. Soon after he departed, he met the Perfectly Awakened One Sarvābhibhū walking toward him along the road. When he saw him, who was fully ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great man, whose figure one would never be tired of looking at, great faith arose in the man. With his mind filled with faith, he then alighted from the vehicle and scattered the flowers made of four kinds of jewels toward the Perfectly Awakened One Sarvābhibhū. The Perfectly Awakened One Sarvābhibhū exercised his magical power so that these flowers became as large as chariot wheels, which followed him when he walked and stopped when he stopped. With faith arisen, the man spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Through this great donation,</p>
<p>May I become a buddha, a self-existing one, among beings.</p>
<p>After achieving victory,</p>
<p>May I save those people who were not saved by the victors in the past.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Having scattered excellent golden flowers</p>
<p>For the great ṛṣi, the Blessed One Sarvābhibhū,</p>
<p>I made this vast aspiration,</p>
<p>Yearning for the supreme state.</p>
<p>“ ‘Through the maturation of this merit,</p>
<p>The city of that King Mahāsudarśana,</p>
<p>Made of gold and pleasing,</p>
<p>Was named the capital, Kuśāvatī.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, Great King? That one who was the son of the head of a guild at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my gaining faith in the Perfectly Awakened One Sarvābhibhū and scattering flowers made of four kinds of jewels, a golden rain fell in my palace for seven days.”</p>
<p>c. A Former Life of King Māndhātṛ: A Grain Merchant</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did King Māndhātṛ create that matured to cause  his going to the Thirty-Three Gods, after ruling over the kingdom in the four continents?”</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past there appeared in the world a teacher named Vipaśyin, who was a perfectly awakened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, a sugata, world knowing, a supreme tamer of people to be tamed, a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. In his travels, in due course he arrived at the royal capital, Bandhumatī.</p>
<p>“Soon after, the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Bandhumatī, the royal capital, for alms. There a certain merchant dealing in grains saw the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin, whose figure one would never tire of looking at, and then faith arose in the merchant. With faith arisen, he scooped up some mudga beans and poured them into a bowl. Out of these mudga beans, four entered the bowl, one hit the edge of the bowl and fell to the ground, and the rest fell directly on the ground, not reaching the bowl. Then, his faith having further increased, the merchant made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘Through this great donation,</p>
<p>May I become a buddha, a self-existing one, among beings.</p>
<p>After achieving victory,</p>
<p>May I save those people who were not saved by the victors in the past.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, Great King? That one who was the merchant dealing in grains at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. There, my faith in the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin arisen, I scooped up some mudga beans and poured them into his bowl, four of which entered the bowl and the rest fell on the ground. Because of the maturation of this karma, I ruled over the kingdom in the four continents.  Because of the maturation of the karma in which one mudga bean hit the edge of the bowl and fell to the ground, I went to the Thirty-Three Gods. Great King, if the rest of the beans that had been poured had not fallen on the ground, I would have ruled over the kingdom among the gods and humans because of the maturation of that karma. That one who was the merchant dealing in grains at that time, on that occasion, was indeed King Māndhātṛ. Therefore, Great King, it will generate a great fruit, a great benefit, to perform service for the Buddha, the Blessed One, who possesses great compassion. Great King, you must learn that you should perform service for the Buddha, the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>2. Mahāsudarśana</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there appeared a wheel-turning king named Mahāsudarśana, who had conquered the border regions in the four directions, was a righteous Dharma king, and had attained the seven treasures and four kinds of human success.</p>
<p>“What were the seven treasures King Mahāsudarśana possessed? They were the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister.</p>
<p>“What were the four kinds of human success King Mahāsudarśana possessed?</p>
<p>“He had a long life, living for an exceptionally long time: While he was playing princely games, eighty-four thousand years passed. While he was in the position of crown prince, another eighty-four thousand years passed. While he was ruling over the great kingdom, another eighty-four thousand years passed. While he was leading the pure life of a royal ṛṣi, another eighty-four thousand years passed. This is said to be a success of King Mahāsudarśana: namely, his long life, his living for an exceptionally long time.</p>
<p>“Moreover, King Mahāsudarśana  was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold—he surpassed the human figure, though he did not attain a divine figure. This is said to be a success of King Mahāsudarśana: namely, his being well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold.</p>
<p>“Moreover, King Mahāsudarśana was by nature free from harm and free from disease, and his temperature was in a good state, neither too cold nor too hot, but healthy. His stomach did not suffer any harm, and he safely digested all food and drink, whatever he consumed. This is said to be a success of King Mahāsudarśana: namely, his being naturally free from harm and disease.</p>
<p>“Moreover, King Mahāsudarśana was admired and loved by the citizens and provincial dwellers, just like a father by his sons. Great King, whenever he went to a park, King Mahāsudarśana ordered the charioteer, ‘Charioteer, drive the chariot properly and slowly. I will take the time to see the citizens and provincial dwellers.’ The citizens and provincial dwellers asked the charioteer, too, ‘Charioteer, drive the chariot properly and slowly. We will take the time to see His Majesty, too.’ This is said to be a success of King Mahāsudarśana: namely, his being admired and loved by the citizens and provincial dwellers.</p>
<p>“One day the citizens and provincial dwellers came to King Mahāsudarśana, bringing much gold and silver and many gems and bejeweled blankets. Upon their arrival, they said to King Mahāsudarśana, ‘We offer this much gold and silver and this many gems and bejeweled blankets to Your Majesty. May Your Majesty have compassion  and accept them.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Gentlemen, I do not want them, for I have such wealth in my land,’ said the king, and he did not accept them.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the citizens and provincial dwellers offered the treasures a second and a third time, but King Mahāsudarśana refused the second and the third time to accept them. The citizens and provincial dwellers thought, ‘We have prepared much gold and silver and many gems and bejeweled blankets for His Majesty. It would not be right for us to return home with them. We will now pile up a mountain of gold and silver in front of King Mahāsudarśana, put the gems and bejeweled blankets to one side, say, “These are your possessions, Your Majesty,” and leave, not looking at them.’</p>
<p>“Then the citizens and provincial dwellers did pile up a mountain of gold and silver in front of King Mahāsudarśana, put the gems and bejeweled blankets to one side, said, “These are your possessions, Your Majesty,” and left, not looking at them.’</p>
<p>“King Mahāsudarśana thought, ‘Since such wealth has been obtained lawfully, not unlawfully, I will now build a palace that is in accordance with the law.’ Eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings heard that King Mahāsudarśana was going to build a palace in accordance with the law. After they had heard this, they went to King Mahāsudarśana, and when they arrived,  they said to King Mahāsudarśana, ‘Your Majesty, please do not worry about building a palace that is in accordance with the law. We will build Your Majesty’s palace, in accordance with the law.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Gentlemen, since I have such wealth in my land, I do not need it,’ said the king, and he did not assent. Then the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings threw themselves at the feet of King Mahāsudarśana. Some caught the hem of his garment and some made the gesture of supplication to King Mahāsudarśana, and they implored him, ‘Your Majesty, please do not worry about building a palace that is in accordance with the law. We will build Your Majesty’s palace, in accordance with the law.’</p>
<p>“King Mahāsudarśana then assented to the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings by remaining silent.</p>
<p>“Thereupon each of the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings, knowing that King Mahāsudarśana had assented by remaining silent, departed for his own residence. They then went back to King Mahāsudarśana, carrying much gold and silver and pillars made of jewels. Upon their arrival, they asked King Mahāsudarśana, ‘Where should we build Your Majesty’s palace, in accordance with the law, and what size should it be?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Gentlemen, in this case you should build a palace that is in accordance with the law one yojana in length and width to the east of Kuśāvatī.’</p>
<p>“Then the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings built the palace in accordance with the law one yojana in length and width to the east of Kuśāvatī. They established foundations made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal for the palace, in accordance with the law. They built pillars made of gold . . .   and crystal for the palace, in accordance with the law. The pedestals, bearing blocks, capitals, and beams of the gold pillars were made of silver; those of the silver pillars were made of gold; those of the lapis lazuli pillars were made of crystal; and the pedestals, bearing blocks, capitals, and beams of the crystal pillars were made of lapis lazuli. They set up four kinds of short beams, rafters, and long beams made of gold . . . and crystal for the palace, in accordance with the law. They put up four kinds of domes made of gold . . . and crystal on the palace, in accordance with the law. They covered the palace, in accordance with the law, with four kinds of slabs made of gold . . . and crystal. They built four kinds of staircases made of gold . . . and crystal in the palace, in accordance with the law. They surrounded the palace, in accordance with the law, with four kinds of parapets made of gold . . . and crystal. The nails, rails, and bases of the gold parapets were made of silver; those of the silver parapets were made of gold; those of the lapis lazuli parapets were made of crystal; and those of the crystal parapets were made of lapis lazuli. Furthermore, they built eighty-four thousand balconies made of gold . . . and crystal on the palace, in accordance with the law. On the balconies made of gold, they arranged braided couches made of silver, which were covered with woolen cloth, cushions, satin cloth, white blankets,  and cloth from Kaliṅga, and were provided with an upper covering and red pillows at both ends. On the silver balconies, couches made of gold; on the lapis lazuli balconies, couches made of crystal; on the crystal balconies, they arranged braided couches made of lapis lazuli, which were . . . red pillows at both ends.</p>
<p>“In front of the gold balcony, they arranged palm trees made of silver, whose leaves, flowers, and fruits were made of gold; in front of the silver balcony, palm trees made of gold; in front of the lapis lazuli balcony, palm trees made of crystal; and in front of the crystal balcony, palm trees made of lapis lazuli, whose leaves, flowers, and fruits were made of crystal. When these palm trees swayed in the breeze, they made a pleasant sound as if a skilled musician were skillfully playing a five-part musical instrument.</p>
<p>“In the palace that was in accordance with the law they spread golden sand, sprinkled sandalwood water, and set up golden nets to which golden bells were tied.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, knowing that all the construction of the palace that was in accordance with the law had been completed, the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings dug a pond in accordance with the law, one yojana in length and width, in front of the palace in accordance with the law, and lined the pond in accordance with the law with slabs made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal.</p>
<p>“They built four kinds of staircases made of gold . . . and crystal in the pond that was in accordance with the law. They surrounded the pond that was in accordance with the law with four kinds of parapets made of gold . . . and crystal. The nails, rails, and bases of the gold parapets were made of silver; those of the silver parapets were made of gold;  those of the lapis lazuli parapets were made of crystal; and the nails, rails, and bases of the crystal parapets were made of lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>“In the pond that was in accordance with the law, they grew various aquatic flowers, namely, utpala, padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka, saugandhika, mṛdugandhika, and flowers of all seasons—flowers of all times of year that were harmless to everyone.</p>
<p>“On two banks of the pond that was in accordance with the law, they grew various terrestrial flowers, namely, atimuktaka, campaka, pāṭala, vārṣikā, mallikā, navamallikā, sumanā, yūthikā, dhānuṣkārī, and flowers of all seasons—flowers of all times of year that were harmless to everyone.</p>
<p>“Around the pond that was in accordance with the law, they spread golden sand, sprinkled sandalwood water, and set up golden nets to which golden bells were tied.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, knowing that all the construction of the pond that was in accordance with the law had been completed, the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings made a palm tree forest that was in accordance with the law, one yojana in length and width, in front of the pond that was in accordance with the law. In the palm tree forest that was in accordance with the law, they made four kinds of palm trees made of gold . . . crystal. The leaves, flowers, and fruits of the gold palm trees were made of silver; those of the silver palm trees were made of gold; those of the lapis lazuli palm trees were made of crystal; and those of the crystal palm trees were made of lapis lazuli. When these palm trees swayed in the breeze, they made a pleasant sound as if a skilled musician were skillfully playing a five-part musical instrument.</p>
<p>“They surrounded the palm tree forest that was in accordance with the law with four kinds of parapets made of gold, silver,  jewels, and crystal. The nails, rails, and bases of the gold parapets were made of silver . . . . In the palm tree forest that was in accordance with the law they spread golden sand, sprinkled sandalwood water, and set up golden nets to which golden bells were tied.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, knowing that all the construction of the palace that was in accordance with the law, the pond that was in accordance with the law, and the palm tree forest that was in accordance with the law had been completed, the eighty-four thousand neighboring minor kings went to King Mahāsudarśana. When they arrived, they said to King Mahāsudarśana, ‘We have built Your Majesty’s palace in accordance with the law, a pond in accordance with the law, and a palm tree forest. May Your Majesty know that their time has now come.’</p>
<p>“Then King Mahāsudarśana thought, ‘It would not be right for me to live by myself in this palace first. In the palace that is in accordance with the law, I will now give food to śramaṇas, brahmins, and people of good conduct living in my land and provide each of them with a pair of new cotton robes.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahāsudarśana gave food to five hundred self-awakened ones, provided each of them with a pair of new cotton robes, and spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Having attained vast wealth,</p>
<p>The wise do not become careless.</p>
<p>They give donations to people of good conduct</p>
<p>Where they will bear fruit.</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus an intelligent man gives</p>
<p>With a liberated mind in this world;</p>
<p>The wise will be reborn</p>
<p>In a harmless, happy world.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that wheel-turning king named Mahāsudarśana, who had ruled the four continents  and had attained the seven treasures and four kinds of human success at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the wheel-turning king named Mahāsudarśana, who had ruled the four continents and had attained the seven treasures and four kinds of human success at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distribution of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>3. Velāma</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a very wealthy brahmin named Velāma. He gave donations to brahmins as follows:</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand elephants adorned with gold, illuminated with gold, decorated with golden banners, and covered with golden nets.</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand horses adorned with gold, illuminated with gold, and covered with golden nets.</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand chariots made of either of four kinds of materials, namely, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, or crystal, covered with lion skins, leopard skins, and white blankets, and decorated with flags of victory.</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand golden vessels filled with powdered silver.</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand silver vessels filled with gold dust.</p>
<p>“He gave brahmins eighty-four thousand braided couches made of either of four kinds of materials—namely, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, or crystal—covered  with woolen cloth, cushions, large coverings, and cloth from Kaliṅga, and provided with an upper covering and red pillows at both ends; eighty-four thousand pairs of bolts of four kinds of cloth, namely, cloth from Kāśi, linen cloth, dukūla cloth, and koṭambaka cloth; eighty-four thousand cows that had golden horns, silver hooves, calves with beautiful coats of fur, and bronze buckets and were covered with pairs of pieces of cotton cloth; and eighty-four thousand girls well adorned with golden armlets and necklaces. He gave all of these as donations, not to mention food and drink—foods to eat, drink, lick, and suck.</p>
<p>“Great King, greater than such donations made to brahmins by the very wealthy brahmin Velāma is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one hundred ṛṣis who are non-Buddhist ascetics and free from desires.</p>
<p>“Great King, greater than such donations made to brahmins by the very wealthy brahmin Velāma and one who gives food to one hundred ṛṣis who are non-Buddhist ascetics and free from desires is the result of the donation of one who gives food to a single ordinary person dwelling in a forest of jambū trees.</p>
<p>“Greater than such donations made to brahmins by the very wealthy brahmin Velāma and one who gives food to one hundred ṛṣis who are non-Buddhist ascetics and free from desires is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one person who is going to actualize the fruit of stream-entry.”</p>
<p>(This and so on are supposed to be stated in detail; only the conclusion of each case should be written as follows.)</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of stream-entry  is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one stream-enterer.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred stream-enterers is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one person who is going to actualize the fruit of a once-returner.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of a once-returner is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one once-returner.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred once-returners is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one person who is going to realize the fruit of a never-returner.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of a never-returner is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one never-returner.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred never-returners is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one person who is going to actualize the fruit of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of an arhat is the result of the donation of one who gives food to one arhat.</p>
<p>“Greater than the donation of one who gives food to one hundred arhats is the result of one who offers a park to the community of monks in the four directions.</p>
<p>“Greater than this is the result of one who has a monastery built in the park.</p>
<p>“Greater than this is the result of one who provides the monastery with seats and bedding, namely, couches, stools, cushions, blankets, pillows, and square mats.</p>
<p>“Greater than this is the result of one who frequently makes offerings suitable for conditions in the monastery.</p>
<p>“Greater than this is the result of one who seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community and accepts the rules of training.</p>
<p>“Greater than this is the result of one who possesses thoughts of love . . . .</p>
<p>“Great King, greater than such a donation made to brahmins by the very wealthy brahmin Velāma; one who gives food to one hundred ṛṣis who are non-Buddhist ascetics and free from desires; one who gives food to one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of stream-entry; one hundred stream-enterers; one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of a once-returner; one hundred once-returners; one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of a never-returner; one hundred never-returners; one hundred people who are going to actualize the fruit of an arhat; one hundred arhats; one who offers a park to the community of monks in the four directions; one who has a monastery built in the park; one who provides the monastery with seats and bedding, namely, couches, stools, cushions, blankets, pillows, and square blankets; one who frequently makes offerings suitable for conditions in the monastery; one who seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community and accepts the rules of training; and one who possesses thoughts of love . . . is the result of one who observes that all conditioned things are impermanent, who observes exhaustion, who observes freedom from desire, who observes cessation, and who observes emancipation.</p>
<p>“Great King, therefore you must learn this: You must observe that all conditioned things are impermanent.  You must observe exhaustion, freedom from desire, cessation, and emancipation. Great King, you must learn this.</p>
<p>“Great King, having thus given donations to brahmins and made merit, the very wealthy brahmin Velāma spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘One who gives donations will become happy.</p>
<p>One who gives donations has no fear.</p>
<p>He himself is served with donations</p>
<p>Among gods and humans.</p>
<p>“ ‘Therefore one who wishes for prosperity,</p>
<p>Kingship, heaven,</p>
<p>And liberation always</p>
<p>Gives donations without fear.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that very wealthy brahmin named Velāma at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the very wealthy brahmin named Velāma at that time, on that occasion, and there I gave such donations to brahmins.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>4. Kuśa</p>
<p>a. The Story of Prince Kuśa</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a strong king named Śakuna. He was a good friend of Śakra, Lord of the Gods, but he had no son or daughter. He was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, thinking, ‘Although I have such wealth and sovereignty, I have no son or daughter. After my death, my family lineage will end.’ Śakra, Lord of the Gods, saw him and asked, ‘My friend, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Kauśika,’ answered the king, ‘although I have such wealth and sovereignty, I have no son or  daughter. After my death, my family lineage will end.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My friend, I will send you a certain medicine,’ Śakra said. ‘Give it to your consorts, and you will have sons and daughters.’</p>
<p>“Śakra, Lord of the Gods, went to Mount Gandhamādana, found the medicine, and sent it to the king. The king gave it to his consorts, saying, ‘Take this medicine,’ but the king’s chief consort was asleep then. The other women took the medicine, not waking her up, and they all became pregnant. After that, the chief consort woke up and saw them pregnant. She asked, ‘What did you do to become pregnant?’</p>
<p>“ ‘His Majesty gave us a certain medicine to take,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why did you not wake me up? Anyway, in what vessel was the medicine brought?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It was wrapped in kuśa grass.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Where is the grass?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Here.’</p>
<p>“She washed the kuśa grass and drank the water, and she became pregnant, too. After eight or nine months, a boy was born to all of them. The chief consort gave birth to a son who had eighteen inauspicious marks, a face like a lion’s, and the power of a great nagna. A great celebration was held at his birth, and he was named Kuśa. The king was pleased when he saw the other sons, but he became angry at Kuśa because the prince’s looks were unpleasant.</p>
<p>“Neighboring minor kings said to each other, ‘Sirs, we are all oppressed by this King Mahāśakuni. Let us drive him out of the kingdom.’ They advanced with an army consisting of four divisions and surrounded the king’s city. Unable to fight them, King Mahāśakuni shut the gates, deployed his army on the walls, and stood there.</p>
<p>“Kuśa went to his mother and asked, ‘Mother, why have the gates been shut?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your father is unable to fight the neighboring minor kings,  and he has shut the gates and stands there.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, I will fight them. The king should give me a chariot.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, you are unloved by him and you anger him. Why would he give you a chariot?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, please go to him. Please go and say, “Prince Kuśa will fight them. Please give him a chariot.” ’</p>
<p>“She went and said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, the prince says, “I will fight them. Please give me a chariot.” ’</p>
<p>“When the king had given him a chariot, the prince mounted it, carrying two quivers of arrows, and departed. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, ‘These neighboring minor kings are strong. Prince Kuśa, the bodhisattva of this fortunate eon, will experience difficulty. I will help him.’</p>
<p>“He gave the prince a conch shell, chakra, and club and said, ‘O bodhisattva, you should survive with these.’</p>
<p>“The prince opened the gate and set out. When he blew the conch shell, the army was frightened by the sound. Some were deafened by it, and some ran away, covering their ears. When he threw the chakra and club, people fell to the ground. When he went into the middle of the battlefield and blew the conch shell, the eardrums of everyone shattered. They ran away, thinking, ‘This man is a rākṣasa!’ The prince won a complete victory and returned to his father.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I have subdued all the kings. Your land is now perfect.’</p>
<p>“When he heard this, King Mahāśakuni was delighted. He said to himself, ‘Prince Kuśa is strong and of perfect vigor. Why did I feel hatred toward him?’</p>
<p>“The king began to feel pleased with the prince.</p>
<p>“When he let his sons marry, he tried to find a wife for Kuśa, too. But all of those he asked for their daughters said, ‘I would give my daughter to anyone but Kuśa.’</p>
<p>“When a certain king  had asked for another king’s daughter, and he had not yet married her, King Mahāśakuni asked for the girl under the pretense of asking for her for another son of his and gave the girl to Kuśa. Investigating constellations and consulting the sundial to choose an auspicious day, time, and moment, he had Prince Kuśa and the girl marry each other. The king then issued an order: ‘Sirs, none should show a mirror to Prince Kuśa. Let him wash without entering the water. Do not let him go to his wife in the daytime.’</p>
<p>“When Prince Kuśa was playing with his brothers, his wife saw him and asked some others, ‘Who is that fiend playing among the princes?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It is your husband.’</p>
<p>“ ‘How could my husband be this kind of man?’</p>
<p>“Later, she again saw him playing with water with the other princes. Having asked and been answered in the same way, she lamented, ‘My husband is this kind of man!’</p>
<p>“She determined, though, that she would confirm it. She lit a lamp and covered it with a pot. When the prince came to his wife, she uncovered the lamp and she saw him, he who had eighteen inauspicious marks and a face like a lion. She ran away, crying, ‘Fiend! Fiend!’</p>
<p>“A certain hamlet chief revolted against King Mahāśakuni. The king sent Prince Kuśa there, ordering him, ‘Go and conquer the people of that hamlet.’ When he had gone there, Kuśa’s wife sent a message to her parents: ‘Are there any other men in the world? You gave me to a fiend. If you kill me, that’s fine. If you do not, I will kill myself.’ They then took her back.</p>
<p>“Having conquered the hamlet chief, Prince Kuśa returned and asked his mother, ‘Mother, where is my wife?’</p>
<p>“ ‘She was taken back by her parents,’ his mother replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why?’</p>
<p>“ ‘She thought you were a fiend.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, I will go and take her back.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You should do so.’</p>
<p>“He departed, carrying his conch shell, chakra, and club. At that time, in a certain hamlet, many people had shut the gates and were watching in every direction for fear of a lion.  Prince Kuśa asked them, ‘Why are you doing such a thing?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Because of fear of a lion.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do you not kill it?’</p>
<p>“ ‘We cannot.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I kill it, what will you give me?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Half of an army consisting of four divisions.’</p>
<p>“When Kuśa approached the lion and blew his conch shell, it died, its eardrums broken. He brought it to the hamlet.</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, here is the lion.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Please take half of an army consisting of four divisions.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Keep it with you here’ he replied, ‘and give it to me when I come back.’</p>
<p>“He went to the hamlet where his wife was, and went to a garland maker. The garland maker asked, ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am the son of a garland maker,’ he answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘What is your name?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Vuṭaka.’</p>
<p>“Bodhisattvas are experts in the arts and technical skills. He skillfully made garlands. The garland maker gave the girl, Kuśa’s wife, one of the garlands. ‘You have never made such a garland,’ she remarked. ‘What is the reason for this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘My disciple made it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I must see your disciple.’</p>
<p>“The garland maker took Kuśa there. She saw him and wondered, ‘Where has this fiend come from?’ She drove him off, crying, ‘Fiend! Fiend!’</p>
<p>“He then went to a cook, and the cook asked, ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am the son of a cook.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What is your name?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sthālisugandha.’</p>
<p>“He skillfully boiled and baked. The cook served the boiled and baked food to the girl. ‘My man,’ she asked, ‘who skillfully boiled and baked this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘My disciple did.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I must see your disciple.’</p>
<p>“. . . Again he was driven off.</p>
<p>“He then went to a physician, and the physician asked, ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am the son of a physician.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What is your name?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Ātreya.’</p>
<p>“When the girl had a headache, the physician  was plunged into grief, being unable to cure her. Kuśa asked him, ‘Master, why are you plunged into grief?’</p>
<p>“ ‘The princess has a headache, but I am not able to cure her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will go and cure her.’</p>
<p>“He went to her, and when she saw him she thought, ‘Where has this fiend come from?’ Then she thought, ‘If I say something, he will not heal me. I will say it when I have been healed.’ When she had been healed, she cried, ‘Fiend! Fiend!’ and drove him off.</p>
<p>“He went to ministers and they asked him, ‘Who are you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am a match for a thousand.’</p>
<p>“They hired him.</p>
<p>“The prince who had once been the fiancé of the princess heard that the princess, whom he had once almost gained, had abandoned Prince Kuśa and gone home. He sent a message to the king (the father of the princess): ‘If you give me your daughter, that’s fine. But if you do not, you will lose your kingdom.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I have already given this daughter of mine to Prince Kuśa, a son of King Mahāśakuni,’ the king replied. ‘How could I give her to another man?’</p>
<p>“That prince came with an army consisting of four divisions and surrounded the palace. Unable to fight him, the king shut the gates and stood there. Prince Kuśa asked the ministers, ‘Sirs, why did you shut the gates?’ When they had explained the details to him, Prince Kuśa said, ‘If the daughter of the king is given to me, I will fight him.’</p>
<p>“They reported this to the king. The king said, ‘I have already given this daughter to a son of King Mahāśakuni. How could I give her to this man? This present conflict itself has happened in relation to this daughter.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ said the ministers, ‘we do not know which will win. Let him fight them for the time being. Then we will arrange the matter suitably.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You should do so,’ agreed the king.</p>
<p>“The ministers ordered him, ‘You, match for a thousand, do as you said.’</p>
<p>“Prince Kuśa then departed, holding two quivers that contained five hundred arrows each,  and carrying a conch shell, chakra, and club. When he had blown the conch shell, the enemy ran away, their eardrums broken. The princess thought, ‘Since this Prince Kuśa has great vigor and courage, why should I feel revulsion toward him?’ She felt pleased with him and said to the king, ‘Please do as you promised.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My daughter, I have given you to Kuśa.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Father,’ she said, ‘that Prince Kuśa is none other than this man.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My daughter, if so, go with him.’</p>
<p>“The king gave him an army consisting of four divisions. He also gave him his daughter, performing a great ceremony.</p>
<p>“The prince returned to the hamlet and requested them, ‘Sirs, give me that half of an army consisting of four divisions.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Prince,’ they replied, ‘there was such a flood that it carried away the four-division army.’</p>
<p>“There were sheep walking nearby. Prince Kuśa spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Where elephants, which are large animals living up to sixty years,</p>
<p>Were brought,</p>
<p>Cows and sheep would have been brought, too.</p>
<p>Thus should one conjecture.</p>
<p>“ ‘If you give it to me, that’s fine. But if you do not, I will destroy you.’</p>
<p>They gave him the army.</p>
<p>“He stayed near a river, and when he had leisure time, he entered the river to bathe. He saw the image of his face there and thought, ‘I have eighteen inauspicious marks and a face like a lion. This is why the princess felt revulsion toward me. What use is the life of such a man like me? I will go and kill myself.’</p>
<p>“He went to a certain dense forest and tried to hang himself. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, ‘Although he is the bodhisattva of the fortunate eon, he will kill himself because of a lack of beauty. I must fulfill his wish.’</p>
<p>“Śakra  said, ‘O Prince, do not be depressed. Do not kill yourself. Wear this crest jewel on your head, and your wish will be fulfilled.’ Then he departed.</p>
<p>“When Prince Kuśa tried to enter his residence, a guard stopped him, saying, ‘This is the palace of Prince Kuśa. You cannot enter.’</p>
<p>“ ‘That Kuśa is me,’ he replied.</p>
<p>“The guard did not believe him. The prince took the crest jewel off and he looked as before, so then the guard believed him. Prince Kuśa thought that he would stay there. He then sent a message to his father: ‘Please be informed that I am here.’</p>
<p>“Śakra, Lord of the Gods, told him about mines of four kinds of treasure. He had the city built with four kinds of precious materials. Since Prince Kuśa lived there, the city was named Kuśāvatī. He became a wheel-turning king of power named Kuśa. He built places for offerings in sixty thousand cities. He gave donations to brahmins for years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. Seeing the perfection of his offerings, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Among gods and humans,</p>
<p>Seeing his own wealth,</p>
<p>Who will not give donations</p>
<p>From which he will attain success?</p>
<p>“ ‘Having conquered hundreds of humans</p>
<p>And defeated the enemy, avarice,</p>
<p>One who fears the next life gives donations</p>
<p>And regards himself as the hero of heroes.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who go into battle with weapons in their hands</p>
<p>Are not heroes, say the munis.</p>
<p>Those who give donations without fear</p>
<p>Are heroes, says the Omniscient One.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that wheel-turning king of power named Kuśa and gave donations and made merit in the sixty thousand cities at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was  the wheel-turning king of power named Kuśa at that time, on that occasion, and there I built places for offerings in sixty thousand cities, gave donations, and made merit.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by those donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; those donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>b. The Former Life of Prince Kuśa</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did Kuśa create that matured to cause him to have eighteen inauspicious marks and to be born to a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by Kuśa himself, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach him like a flood, inevitably. Who else but Kuśa would experience the actions that he himself performed and accumulated? Monks, actions performed and accumulated do not mature in the earth element, the water element, the fire element, or the wind element, which are outside the body. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated like this mature in the aggregates, elements, and sense spheres.</p>
<p>“Even after hundreds of eons,</p>
<p>Actions are never lost.</p>
<p>When the time and conditions are right,</p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there lived a householder in a hamlet. He went to a park, taking various kinds of plentiful food with him.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear, there appear self-awakened ones as the only ones worthy of veneration in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with places to sit on the outskirts of towns.</p>
<p>“At that time, a certain wandering self-awakened one arrived at the park. When he saw him, the householder ordered his laborers, ‘Sirs, drive this mendicant away.’</p>
<p>“They were not able to drive him away. The householder stood up, caught the self-awakened one by himself, and drove him away, saying, ‘Where are you going, you who have a face like a lion and eighteen inauspicious marks?’</p>
<p>“The self-awakened one thought, ‘Alas, it is not right if this man is always hurt and injured.’ He soared high into the sky . . . . The householder served him, and then threw himself at the feet of the self-awakened one and made an aspiration: ‘May I not receive the karma I created of harsh speech toward such an excellent one worthy of veneration. May I be born to a family that is rich and has great wealth and many possessions, through this root of merit from performing service for him.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That householder was indeed this Prince Kuśa. Because of the maturation of the karma he created of harsh speech toward the self-awakened one there, he became one who had eighteen inauspicious marks and a face like a lion. And because of the maturation of the karma of performing service for him, he became a wheel-turning king of power.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative; the maturation of entirely positive actions is entirely positive; the maturation of those that are mixed is mixed. Therefore, monks, henceforth you should abandon entirely negative and mixed actions, and you should seek entirely positive actions. Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>5. Triśaṅku</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a mātaṅga king named Triśaṅku in a country called Kaliṅga, who had hundreds and  thousands—hundreds of thousands—of mātaṅga attendants, was naturally loving and merciful, benefited all beings, and had compassion for them. Whenever a famine broke out in his country, the gods brought rain in answer to his appeal to the truth, so that there was never a serious famine. He went forth among ṛṣis and realized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“ At that time in Vārāṇasī, a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  One day astrologers predicted that it would not rain for twelve years. King Brahmadatta then announced with the ringing of bells in the city of Vārāṇasī: ‘Listen, sirs, citizens living in Vārāṇasī! Astrologers have predicted that it will not rain for twelve years. Whoever among you has food for the duration should stay. Those who do not should leave.’</p>
<p>“Then many people began to discuss this with each other for fear of an untimely death from the famine: ‘Sirs, such-and-such a matter has been announced by the king who rules over the regions. What should we do about this? Where should we go?’ They heard that there was a ṛṣi from a mātaṅga family in the country of the mātaṅgas, and gods brought rain in answer to his appeal to the truth. Those who did not have food for twelve years went to the country of the mātaṅgas. The king of the mātaṅgas, the son of a ṛṣi from a mātaṅga family, provided the people with food and drink for twelve years. The famine persisted, and King Brahmadatta asked his ministers, ‘Where did those people go?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ answered the ministers, ‘there is a mātaṅga king named Triśaṅku in the country of Kaliṅga, who is naturally loving and merciful, benefits all beings, and has compassion for them. Gods bring rain in answer to his appeal to the truth, and so  many people went there.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, this great famine seems to be an interval between even greater famines. What should we do about this?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they replied, ‘we have heard that this king of the country of the mātaṅgas went forth among ṛṣis. Please request help from him.’</p>
<p>“Then King Brahmadatta went to the country of the mātaṅgas and requested help from the ṛṣi: ‘O great ṛṣi, a great famine, which seems to be an interval between even greater famines, has broken out in my country. It would be appropriate if you could make an appeal to the truth about this.’</p>
<p>“The ṛṣi then made an appeal to the truth:</p>
<p>“ ‘I, a mātaṅga named Triśaṅku,</p>
<p>Who was born to the lineage of Śvapāka,</p>
<p>Am free from wrath and free from enemies,</p>
<p>And am well known to gods and humans—</p>
<p>“ ‘By my true words,</p>
<p>I who have well cultivated faultless thoughts of love</p>
<p>Toward all beings,</p>
<p>May nāgas satisfy these people.</p>
<p>“ ‘In answer to my true words,</p>
<p>For the purpose of which</p>
<p>I have, from birth, well practiced love,</p>
<p>May nāgas satisfy these people.’</p>
<p>“In answer to this appeal to the truth, the gods brought rain to Vārāṇasī. The famine ended, and there was a bumper crop. After that, the inhabitants of Vārāṇasī came back from the country of mātaṅgas to Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that mātaṅga king named Triśaṅku, naturally loving and merciful, who benefited all beings and had compassion for them, and in answer to whose appeal to the truth the gods brought rain so that the famine ended and there was a bumper crop at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the mātaṅga king named Triśaṅku, who was naturally loving and merciful, who benefited all beings and had compassion for them, and in answer to whose appeal to the truth the gods brought rain so that the famine ended and there was a bumper crop at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were  only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>6. Mahādeva</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in Mithilā there appeared a king named Mahādeva, a wheel-turning king who had conquered the border regions in the four directions, a righteous Dharma king who had attained the seven treasures. His seven treasures were as follows: the precious chakra, elephant, horse, jewel, woman, householder, and minister. He also had a thousand sons who were brave, bold, and endowed with excellent physiques, and who would defeat the enemy’s army. He conquered the land entirely, as far as the seashore, without risking harm, without violence, without punishment or weapons, but in accord with the Dharma and impartially.</p>
<p>“Then, when a barber was arranging King Mahādeva’s hair and beard, the king ordered him, ‘My man, when you find Yama’s messengers, white hairs, growing on my head, let me know.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber to King Mahādeva.</p>
<p>“One day when the barber was arranging King Mahādeva’s hair and beard, he did find Yama’s messengers, white hairs, growing on King Mahādeva’s head. Having found them, he said to King Mahādeva, ‘Your Majesty, please be informed that Yama’s messengers, white hairs, are growing on your head.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My man, then gently pull out those white hairs without cutting them and place them in my palm.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber to King Mahādeva, and he gently pulled out the white hairs with a pair of golden tweezers one by one and placed them in King Mahādeva’s palm.</p>
<p>“Holding  the white hairs in both his hands, King Mahādeva then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘On my head,</p>
<p>Hairs that plunder youth are growing.</p>
<p>Since Yama’s messengers have now appeared,</p>
<p>It is time for me to go forth.</p>
<p>“ ‘Since I have enjoyed human desires, it is time for me to seek divine desires. Now I will put my eldest son upon the throne and lead the pure life of a royal ṛṣi.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahādeva summoned his eldest son by messenger and said, ‘Understand, my son, that Yama’s messengers, white hairs, are growing on my head. Since I have enjoyed human desires, it is time for me to seek divine desires. My son, I will entrust you with the land as far as the seashore, so you should protect it lawfully, not unlawfully. If someone’s conduct is unlawful or a mixture of lawful and unlawful, do not let him live in your country.</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, when you too find Yama’s messengers, white hairs, growing on your head, you too should put your eldest son upon the throne and lead the pure life of a royal ṛṣi. Thus, my son, you should complete this virtuous and sure path introduced by me, and you should not break the tradition. You should not be an inferior man.</p>
<p>“ ‘My son, he who lets such a virtuous and sure path, once introduced at such a time as when there were good men, increase will not be the one who breaks their tradition. He will not be an inferior man among them. My son, he who does not let such a virtuous and sure path, once introduced at such a time as when there were good men, increase will be the one who breaks their tradition, and will be an inferior man among them. Therefore I am saying to you  to complete such a virtuous and sure path introduced by me. You should not break the tradition. You should not be an inferior man.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Mahādeva put his eldest son upon the throne and led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi in the mango grove of Mahādeva here, in Mithilā.</p>
<p>“The eldest son who was put upon the throne was also named Mahādeva, a wheel-turning king who had conquered the border regions in the four directions . . . . Then, when a barber was arranging King Mahādeva’s hair and beard . . . . ‘You should not be an inferior man.’ Thereupon that King Mahādeva put his eldest son upon the throne and led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi. Likewise, his son, grandson, great-grandson, and eighty-four thousand Mahādevas in succession led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi.</p>
<p>“Having seen the perfection of his offerings, King Mahādeva spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Among gods and humans</p>
<p>One who seeks kingship</p>
<p>And fears poverty</p>
<p>Gives as many donations as possible.</p>
<p>“ ‘One who gives donations is venerated in this world;</p>
<p>One who gives donations is venerated among the gods.</p>
<p>Just like a fruit tree to birds,</p>
<p>He is the refuge of all living things.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that wheel-turning king named Mahādeva, who established that virtuous and sure path so that on the basis of the virtuous and sure path eighty-four thousand Mahādevas led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi, at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the wheel-turning king named Mahādeva at that time, on that occasion, and none but I established that virtuous and sure path, so that on the basis of the virtuous and sure path eighty-four thousand Mahādevas led the pure life of a royal ṛṣi.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>7. King Nimi</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in this Mithilā there appeared a king named Nimi who was the last in his royal line, a righteous Dharma king who abided in the Dharma. With his consorts, sons, ministers, army, citizens, and provincial dwellers, he practiced the Dharma, gave donations, made merit, practiced abstinence, and practiced moral conduct correctly.</p>
<p>“At that time, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, praised the king in the presence of the Thirty-Three Gods, who were sitting together in the divine meeting hall, Sudharmā: ‘O my friends, the people of Videha have attained a great boon, for Nimi, the king of the people of Videha, is a righteous Dharma king, a great king who abides in the Dharma. With his consorts . . . he practices the Dharma . . . and practices moral conduct correctly. O my friends, do you want to see King Nimi?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, we sincerely wish to do so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, my friends, wait here. I will see King Nimi briefly.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, disappeared from the presence of the Thirty-Three Gods, as quickly as a strong man stretches his bent arm or  bends his stretched arm, and arrived at King Nimi’s palace in Mithilā. He said, ‘O Nimi, you have attained a great boon, for the Thirty-Three Gods, sitting together in the divine meeting hall, Sudharmā, have praised you: “O my friends, the people of Videha . . . . He . . . practices moral conduct correctly.” O Nimi, do you want to go to see the Thirty-Three Gods?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, I do wish to go see the Thirty-Three Gods.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, Nimi, wait here. I will shortly send you a chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses. You should ride in it and come without fear.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I shall do so,’ replied King Nimi to Śakra, Lord of the Gods.</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, went to the Thirty-Three Gods and ordered Mātali, a charioteer, ‘Mātali, go and very quickly prepare a chariot with a thousand fine horses. Go to King Nimi and say, “O Nimi, this is the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses sent to you by Śakra, Lord of the Gods. Come, ride in it without fear.” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Kauśika, what you instructed will be carried out without any mistake,’ replied the charioteer Mātali to Śakra, Lord of the Gods. He prepared very quickly a chariot with a thousand fine horses and went to King Nimi. When he arrived, he said, ‘O Nimi, this is the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses sent to you by Śakra, Lord of the Gods. Come, ride in it without fear.’</p>
<p>“King Nimi rode the chariot drawn by a thousand fine horses without fear. Then the charioteer  Mātali asked King Nimi, ‘Along which side shall I drive your chariot, the side where beings of evil karma experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous karma, or the side where beings of virtuous karma experience the maturation of virtuous karma?’</p>
<p>“ ‘In this case, Mātali, drive the chariot in a way that will enable me to see both, the side where beings of evil karma experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous karma, and the side where beings of virtuous karma experience the maturation of virtuous karma.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the charioteer Mātali drove King Nimi’s chariot in a way that enabled King Nimi to see both, the side where beings of evil karma experience the maturation of evil and nonvirtuous karma, and the side where beings of virtuous karma experience the maturation of virtuous karma.</p>
<p>“King Nimi went to the Thirty-Three Gods and sat in the Thirty-Three Gods’ divine meeting hall, Sudharmā. Śakra, Lord of the Gods, offered half of his seat to King Nimi; King Nimi and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, sat on both halves of the same seat.</p>
<p>“When King Nimi and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, sat on both halves of the same seat, there was no difference, no distinction, and no contrast between them, except that Śakra, Lord of the Gods, did not blink his eyes.</p>
<p>“Then, having seen the perfection of his offerings, King Nimi spoke this verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who act carelessly,</p>
<p>Having seen those who have created virtuous karma</p>
<p>And ones of unwholesome karma,</p>
<p>Are the worst—they’re deplorable people.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, said to King Nimi,  ‘O Nimi, you should stay here and amuse yourself. Play, amuse yourself, and enjoy yourself, enjoying the objects of the five kinds of desires.’</p>
<p>“The king then spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘This place, which is</p>
<p>Under the rule of others, is</p>
<p>Like a vessel and a chariot</p>
<p>Borrowed only for a while.</p>
<p>“ ‘I will return to Mithilā from here</p>
<p>And perform many good deeds.</p>
<p>Having perfected merit,</p>
<p>I will come to heaven.’</p>
<p>“When he had gone back to Mithilā, he gave donations and made merit, and he spoke some other verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Good people praise the donations</p>
<p>Given to kṣatriyas, brahmins,</p>
<p>Vaiśyas, śūdras, caṇḍālas,</p>
<p>And poor pukkasas.</p>
<p>“ ‘Having given donations in a time of famine</p>
<p>And satisfied good people,</p>
<p>They avoid inferior states of existence</p>
<p>And are venerated in this world and in heaven.</p>
<p>“ ‘Knowing this benefit,</p>
<p>Wise men give donations.</p>
<p>By donations, they attain liberation,</p>
<p>Power, and the palace of the gods.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that wheel-turning king Nimi, who went to the Thirty-Three Gods, was given by Śakra, Lord of the Gods, half of his seat and divine objects of the five kinds of desires, came back to Mithilā, built places for offerings at the four gates of the city, gave donations, and made merit, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the wheel-turning king Nimi at that time, on that occasion, who went to the Thirty-Three Gods, was given by Śakra, Lord of the Gods, half of his seat and divine objects of the five kinds of desires, came back to Mithilā, built places for offerings at the four gates of the city, gave donations, and made merit.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>8. Ādarśamukha</p>
<p>“After him (Nimi), there was a mighty king named Ānanda . . . . One, two, . . . five sons were born to him. The youngest son’s face (mukha) resembled a mirror (ādarśa), and so he was named Ādarśamukha. All these sons were raised and grew up. Prince Ādarśamukha was gentle and well self-controlled. The others were fierce, violent, and rough. When they all met together for their father’s business, they did not resolve anything with intelligence. Prince Ādarśamukha, though, investigated very profound questions with his intelligence.</p>
<p>“When King Ānanda caught a disease, he thought, ‘Whom shall I install on the throne? Whichever of the four elder sons I install on the throne, he will do harm to the people with his bad conduct because these four are fierce, violent, and rough. If I install Prince Ādarśamukha on the throne, kinsmen will condemn this, saying, “Why on earth did this king now install the youngest son on the throne, putting aside the elder sons?” So, I will devise a plan.’</p>
<p>“He prepared three treasures, consorts who would show honor, and six things to be examined with intelligence, and he said to his ministers, ‘Leaders, after my death, you should test each prince. After my death, you should install on the throne the one whom the jeweled shoes fit when he wears them,  for whom the throne remains unmoving when he sits on it, for whom the diadem remains unmoving when he wears it on his head, to whom the consorts show honor, and who possesses all six things to be examined with intelligence: namely, internal treasure, external treasure, internal and external treasure, treasure on the top of a tree, treasure on the top of a mountain, and treasure on a bank.’ Having thus spoken, the king died, saying:</p>
<p>“ ‘All accumulation ends in depletion,</p>
<p>In the end what is lofty will fall,</p>
<p>. . . .’</p>
<p>“When the ministers put the jeweled shoes on the eldest prince, they did not fit. When they put him on the throne, it wobbled. When they put the diadem on him, it wobbled. The consorts did not show honor to him, either. When they told him the six things to be examined with intelligence, he did not know them. It was the same for the next younger brothers.</p>
<p>“When they put the jeweled shoes on Prince Ādarśamukha, however, they fit perfectly. When he sat on the throne, it remained still. When he wore the diadem, it remained still. The consorts, too, showed honor to him. The ministers then told him, ‘Further, you must know the six things to be examined with intelligence: namely, internal treasure, external treasure, internal and external treasure, treasure on the top of a tree, treasure on the top of a mountain, and treasure on a bank.’</p>
<p>“Ādarśamukha thought, ‘They say “internal treasure.” What is internal treasure? It is treasure inside the threshold. They say “external treasure.” What is external treasure? It is treasure outside the threshold. They say “internal and external treasure.” What is internal and external treasure? It is treasure under the threshold. They say “treasure on the top of a tree.” What is treasure on the top of a tree? It is treasure that is in the place where the shadow of the tree under which that king used to sit falls at noon.  They say “treasure on the top of a mountain.” What is treasure on the top of a mountain? It is treasure that is under the stone slab for bathing, which is in that pool where that king enjoyed himself. They say “treasure on a bank.” What is treasure on a bank? It is treasure that is at the end of a drain through which the household water flows.’</p>
<p>“When the ministers examined everything, these treasures were discovered. They therefore anointed him as king. Ādarśamukha became a mighty king.</p>
<p>“A brahmin named Daṇḍin lived in a certain hamlet, and he borrowed bulls from a certain householder. Having plowed a field, he drove those bulls back to the house of the householder. At that time, the householder was having lunch. The brahmin Daṇḍin drove the bulls inside, and they went out through another gate. After finishing lunch, the householder stood up, but he did not see the bulls anywhere. He caught Daṇḍin and asked, ‘Where are the bulls?’</p>
<p>“He replied, ‘Did they not enter the house?’</p>
<p>“ ‘You stole my bulls. Return the bulls to me!’</p>
<p>“ ‘I did not steal them,’ insisted Daṇḍin.</p>
<p>“ ‘Since that King Ādarśamukha is a person of intelligence,’ said the householder, ‘let’s go to him, and he will solve this problem and show us right and wrong.’</p>
<p>“They then departed.</p>
<p>“A certain man had lost a wild mare. He called out to Daṇḍin, ‘Catch the mare!’</p>
<p>“ ‘How should I stop it?’ he replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘In whatever way you can!’</p>
<p>“He took a stone and hit the mare on the head, so it died.</p>
<p>“ ‘You killed my mare. Give me another!’ the man demanded.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why would I give you a mare?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha,’ said the man, ‘and he will issue a ruling.’</p>
<p>“They too departed, and he, Daṇḍin, tried to escape. He leapt down from the top of a wall.  Under it, a weaver was weaving cloth. Daṇḍin fell on him, and the weaver died. Daṇḍin was again caught by the wife of the weaver. She told him, ‘You killed my husband. Give me back my husband!’</p>
<p>“ ‘From where would I bring your husband?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha,’ she said, ‘and he will issue a ruling for us.’</p>
<p>“They too departed. There was a deep river along the way. There, a carpenter was swimming around with an axe in his mouth. Daṇḍin asked him, ‘How deep is the water?’</p>
<p>“ ‘The water is very deep,’ the carpenter answered, letting the axe drop, which then fell into the water. He caught Daṇḍin and said, ‘It is because of you that my axe dropped into the water!’</p>
<p>“ ‘I didn’t drop it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha, and he will issue a ruling.’</p>
<p>“Since they were tired, they entered a tavern, taking Daṇḍin with them. The tavern hostess had a newborn son whom she had wrapped in cloth and kept asleep, and Daṇḍin sat down on him. She cried out, ‘There is a child! There is a child!’ When she looked, the child was dead. She caught Daṇḍin and said, ‘You killed my son. Give me back my son!’</p>
<p>“ ‘I did not kill him,’ he answered. ‘Why would I give you a son?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Come, let us go to King Ādarśamukha,’ she replied.</p>
<p>“Then they departed. In a certain place, there was a raven on a dead tree. It saw Daṇḍin and asked, ‘Where are you going?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am not going anywhere, but these people are taking me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Where?’</p>
<p>“ ‘To Ādarśamukha.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then also take a message for me, and say to King Ādarśamukha, “There is a tree whose leaves are dead in such-and-such a place, and there is a raven there. It asks, ‘Why am I happy when I am here, whereas I am not pleased where there are other trees, the leaves of which are green and shiny?’ ” ’</p>
<p>“They again departed. A deer saw Daṇḍin and asked, ‘Daṇḍin, where are you going?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I am not going anywhere, but these people are taking me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Where?’</p>
<p>“ ‘To Ādarśamukha.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Take my message also, and ask him, “Why, although there are green, grassy meadows in other places, do I not wish for them?” ’</p>
<p>“They again departed. Then a partridge (tittira) saw him and asked, ‘Where are you going?’ . . . ‘Then take my message also, and ask him, “I utter a partridge’s call in one place but utter a different call in another place. What is the reason for this?” ’</p>
<p>“In another place, a snake saw him . . . ‘Then take my message also, and ask him, “It is easy for me to go out of the hole, but it is hard to enter it again. What is the reason for this?” ’</p>
<p>“A serpent and a mongoose were hostile to each other and fighting . . . ‘Then take our message also, and ask him, “We fight by day, whenever one sees the other, and are never pleased with each other. What is the reason for this?” ’</p>
<p>“A certain newly married woman . . . she said, ‘Take my message also, and ask him, “I miss my father-in-law’s house when I am in my father’s house, but I miss my father’s house when I am in my father-in-law’s house. What is the reason for this?” ’</p>
<p>“They again departed and went to King Ādarśamukha. Having arrived  and wished the king victory and long life, Daṇḍin sat down to one side. The others too bowed low until their foreheads touched the feet of the king, and then they took their seats. The king asked Daṇḍin, ‘Why have you come?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I was brought here.’</p>
<p>“ ‘For what reason?’</p>
<p>“Daṇḍin explained why he was in dispute with the householder. The king asked the householder, ‘Did you see the bulls?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, I did.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Daṇḍin, did you drive the bulls inside?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I did.’</p>
<p>“The king decreed, ‘Since he did not let him (the householder) know, cut out this Daṇḍin’s tongue. Since he did not tie the bulls, gouge out his (the householder’s) eyes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘First my bulls were lost, and second, my eyes are to be gouged out! It would be better that Daṇḍin won!’ cried the householder.</p>
<p>“The second man said, ‘Your Majesty, this Daṇḍin killed my mare.’</p>
<p>“ ‘How did he kill it?’</p>
<p>“When he explained it all in detail, the king decreed, ‘Since he said, “Catch it in whatever way you can,” cut out this man’s tongue. Since he was not able to catch it otherwise than by hitting it with a stone, cut off also this Daṇḍin’s hands.’</p>
<p>“ ‘First my mare was killed, and second, my tongue is to be cut out! It would be better that Daṇḍin won!’ cried the second man.</p>
<p>“When the weaver’s wife explained her case in detail, the king decreed, ‘Take this very man as your husband.’</p>
<p>“ ‘First my husband was killed by him, and second, he becomes my husband! It would be better that Daṇḍin won!’ she cried.</p>
<p>“When the carpenter explained his case in detail, the king decreed, ‘Since he uttered words in the river, letting the axe out, cut out this carpenter’s tongue. Since he asked the carpenter when he saw the water was deep, gouge out this Daṇḍin’s eyes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘First my axe was lost, and second, my tongue is to be cut out! It would be better that Daṇḍin won!’ the carpenter cried.</p>
<p>“When the tavern hostess explained her case in detail, the king decreed, ‘Since she laid down the child completely covered with cloth, cut off the hands of this tavern hostess. Since he sat on another’s seat without looking at it first, gouge out Daṇḍin’s eyes.’</p>
<p>“ ‘First my son was killed, and second, my hands are to be cut off! It would be better that Daṇḍin won!’ she cried.</p>
<p>“When Daṇḍin delivered the raven’s message, the king said, ‘Daṇḍin, tell the raven, “There are treasures that you hid under the dead tree when you were the headman of a hamlet that was in that place. Give them to someone and leave, and you will be at ease.” ’</p>
<p>“When he delivered the deer’s message, the king said, ‘You should tell the deer, “Deer, once there was a tree there, and drops of honey were dripping down from its top. Thus, the green meadows were sweetened, and you ate there. Since the honey bees are gone, you should not be attached to the grass. You should not suffer misfortune.” ’</p>
<p>“When he delivered the partridge’s message, the king said, ‘There is no treasure where the partridge utters a partridge’s call, but there are treasures where it utters a different call. Tell it, “You should show the treasure to someone and go somewhere else, for it would not be right if you suffered misfortune.” ’</p>
<p>“When he delivered the message of the serpent and the mongoose, the king said, ‘Tell the two, ‘You were born as two brothers when you were humans. There, one said, “Let us divide our possessions.” The other did not do so, overwhelmed by avarice. There, one was reborn as a serpent because it was excessively attached. The other was reborn as a mongoose because it clung to the possessions and was excessively attached to them.  Therefore, you should give the possessions to śramaṇas or brahmins and relinquish your dwelling, and you will be at ease.” ’</p>
<p>“When he delivered the snake’s message, the king said, ‘You should tell the snake, “When you have become hungry and feeble, you easily exit the hole, but after having eaten much food, you have trouble entering the hole. If you know the proper amount of food to take in, you will live at ease.” ’</p>
<p>“When he delivered the newly married woman’s message, the king said, ‘You should tell the newly married woman, “There is a friend of yours in your father’s house. When you are in your father-in-law’s house, you miss the friend. When you are in your father’s house, you miss your husband. Since it would not be right if you suffered misfortune, relinquish one place and keep well the other.” ’</p>
<p>“The newly married woman and the snake did as they were instructed. The serpent and mongoose and the raven gave the treasures to Daṇḍin. The rest, too, did as they were instructed.</p>
<p>“ ‘Oh, the king appears to be quite brilliant!’ marveled the ministers.</p>
<p>“The king, pleased and delighted, built offering halls at the four city gates and appointed managers of the offerings.</p>
<p>“At that time, there was a famine for twelve years. When that twelve-year famine occurred, he provided hundreds of thousands of beings with food. Taking account of the perfection of his offerings, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘A wise one is in accord with the law—</p>
<p>He does not accumulate wealth.</p>
<p>He makes offerings to those worthy of veneration</p>
<p>Who are perfect in good conduct.</p>
<p>“ ‘Having well satisfied noble śramaṇas, brahmins,</p>
<p>And the destitute,</p>
<p>The intelligent one will be reborn</p>
<p>Among the gods after his body is destroyed.</p>
<p>“ ‘Knowing this, one who is wise</p>
<p>And possessed of faith, with thoughts free from attachment,</p>
<p>Gives to those worthy of veneration,</p>
<p>Which is praised by heroes free from avarice.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that mighty king named Ādarśamukha, who provided hundreds of thousands of beings with food during the twelve-year famine, at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the mighty king named Ādarśamukha, and I provided hundreds of thousands of beings with food during the twelve-year famine at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>9. Sudhana</p>
<p>a. The Story of King Sudhana</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a wheel-turning king named Sudhana. He built places for offerings in eighty-four thousand cities. He gave donations and made merit for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. Having seen the perfection of his offerings, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Among gods and humans,</p>
<p>Who, having seen his own wealth,</p>
<p>Would not give donations</p>
<p>From which he would attain success?</p>
<p>“ ‘Having conquered hundreds of humans</p>
<p>And defeated avarice, which is the enemy,</p>
<p>One who fears the next life gives donations</p>
<p>And regards himself as the hero of heroes.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those who go into battle with weapons in their hands</p>
<p>Are not heroes, say the munis.</p>
<p>Those who give donations without fear</p>
<p>Are heroes, says the Omniscient One.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that wheel-turning king named Sudhana, who built places for offerings in eighty-four thousand cities, who gave donations and made merit for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years—at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the wheel-turning king named Sudhana at that time, on that occasion, who built places for offerings in eighty-four thousand cities, who gave donations and made merit for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>b. The Story of Prince Sudhana</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit, and accomplished the perfection of effort, but I did not attain supreme and complete awakening. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there were two kings in the land of Pañcāla, namely, North Pañcāla and South Pañcāla. King North Pañcāla, called Dhana, in a city called Hastināpura, being a righteous Dharma king ruled in accordance with the Dharma over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, and in which there was no fighting, dispute, strife, or robbers, in which illness had abated, and which was abundant in rice , sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo.</p>
<p>“In that city there was a large, pleasant pond full of utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers, and adorned with haṃsas, cakravākas, and kāraṇḍavas. In the pond there lived the son of a nāga named Janmacitra. He brought rain at the appropriate times, so that the ground was rich in crops. The country had plenty of food and drink, and people gave food to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, and the destitute with generosity, veneration, and respect.</p>
<p>“King South Pañcāla was excessively unrighteous, fierce, violent, and short tempered. He did not rule over the kingdom in accordance with the Dharma and always threatened people living in the country with punishment, beating, hitting, killing, arresting, binding, fettering, chaining, and various other kinds of harm. Because he was excessively unrighteous, the gods did not bring rain at the appropriate times. Thus, through fear and despair, his people abandoned their country at the risk of their lives and went to North Pañcāla’s land, where they settled.</p>
<p>“Later, when King South Pañcāla set out to inspect the country under the pretext of hunting, he saw villages and cities deserted, parks and temples ruined and destroyed. When he saw them, he asked his ministers, ‘Sirs, why are these villages and cities deserted? Why are the parks and temples  ruined and destroyed? Where have those people gone?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the ministers replied, ‘they have gone to the land of Dhana, King North Pañcāla.’</p>
<p>“ ‘For what reason?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please grant us the freedom to speak without fear.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, I do. Speak.’</p>
<p>“And so they told him, ‘Your Majesty, King North Pañcāla rules over the country in accordance with the Dharma, and so his land is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. There is no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, or robbers; illness has abated there; and the country is abundant in rice, sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo. People, eager to offer generosity, veneration, and respect, also give food to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, and the destitute. Your Majesty is fierce, violent, and short tempered, and so you always threaten your people with punishment, beating, hitting, killing, arresting, binding, fettering, chaining, and various other kinds of harm. Therefore, through fear and despair, those people have gone to King North Pañcāla’s land.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs,’ King South Pañcāla asked them, ‘is there any good means whereby those people will come back and live in these villages and cities?’</p>
<p>“The ministers answered, ‘If Your Majesty rules over the country in accordance with the Dharma and protects the land with thoughts of love, benefit, and compassion just as King North Pañcāla does, those people will soon come back and live in these villages and cities.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If so, sirs,’ replied King South Pañcāla, ‘I too will rule over the country in accordance with the Dharma and protect the land with thoughts of love, benefit, and compassion just as King North Pañcāla does.  You should make those people come back and live in these villages and cities by any means.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, there is another advantage. In that city, there is a large pond full of utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers, and adorned with haṃsas, cakravākas, and kāraṇḍavas. There lives the son of a nāga named Janmacitra. Because he duly brings rain at the appropriate times, the ground is richer and richer in crops, and so and the country has plenty of food and drink.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, is there any way to bring that son of a nāga here?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, wielders of spells and mantras could bring him. Please search for them.’</p>
<p>“The king then had a box of gold tied to the top of a banner and had proclaimed throughout the country with the ringing of bells: ‘I will give this box of gold to anyone who brings Janmacitra, the son of a nāga, from North Pañcāla’s land. I will also treat him with great honor.’</p>
<p>“A certain snake charmer went to the ministers and said, ‘If you would give me this box of gold, I will catch and bring Janmacitra, the son of a nāga.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Take it,’ said the ministers.</p>
<p>“ ‘Please have it kept in the hands of someone whom you trust and have confidence in,’ he replied, ‘and give it to me after I bring Janmacitra, the son of a nāga.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do as you have said.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the snake charmer entrusted the box of gold to the hands of a trustworthy man and went to the city of Hastināpura. When he observed the whole area around the pond,  because he was familiar with omens, he thought that Janmacitra, the son of a nāga, was in that very place. He returned for oblations and necessities, requesting the ministers, ‘Please give me oblations and necessities. I will catch and bring the son of a nāga in seven days.’</p>
<p>“Janmacitra too saw the snake charmer and thought, ‘He has come to catch me. I will be caught in seven days and experience the great pain of separation from my parents. What should I do? On whom should I rely?’</p>
<p>“There had lived near the pond two hunters named Sāraka and Phalaka, They had made their living by the pond by killing terrestrial animals such as rabbits, antelope, and boars that came there to drink water, and aquatic animals such as fish, turtles, and frogs. By that time, though, Sāraka was dead, and only Phalaka was alive. Janmacitra, the son of a nāga, thought, ‘There is no one but Phalaka on whom I can rely.’ Then, dressed as a human, he went to the hunter Phalaka and said, ‘Sir, do you know by whose power King Dhana’s land is rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, . . . abundant in rice, sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I do know,’ answered the hunter. ‘It is because the king is righteous, and he rules over the country in accordance with the Dharma and protects the land with thoughts of love, benefit, and compassion.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why only that? It must be because of something else,’ he said.</p>
<p>“The hunter replied, ‘There is another advantage. There lives in this pond the son of a nāga named Janmacitra. Because he duly brings rain at the appropriate times,  the crops have been more and more abundant. Therefore, the ground is richer and richer in crops, and so the land has plenty of food and drink.’</p>
<p>“Janmacitra asked, ‘If someone were to take the son of a nāga by force from this land, what would happen to that son of a nāga?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It would not be right. He would experience the pain of separation from his parents, and the king and the people would suffer hardships caused by his absence.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What would you do to the abductor?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I would kill him.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do you know that son of a nāga?’</p>
<p>“ ‘No, I don’t.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It’s me. A snake charmer from South Pañcāla’s land is trying to catch me. He has gone home for oblations and necessities, but he will come back in seven days. When he comes back, he will drive wedges made from khadira into the four corners of the banks of the pond, tie strings of various colors, and chant mantras. You should hide near him. When he has finished this preparation, the water in the pond will boil and overflow, and I will appear. At that time, you should shoot the snake charmer in a vital part, approach him quickly, and say, “Withdraw the mantra. If you do not, I will cut off your head and throw it on the ground.” If he loses his life and dies without withdrawing the mantra, I will be bound by the noose of the mantra throughout the rest of my life.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Even only to benefit you, I will do that,’ said the hunter, ‘not to mention benefiting the entire country. I will help you.’</p>
<p>“Then the son of a nāga indicated a certain hiding place. On the seventh day, the hunter was hiding in that hiding place, and the snake charmer came there too and began to prepare the oblations and necessities. He drove wedges made from khadira into the four corners of the banks of the pond. He tied strings of various colors  and chanted mantras. Then the water began to boil. The hunter shot him in a vital part and, having unsheathed a sword, said, ‘Are you trying to take the son of a nāga living in our land by force with a mantra? Withdraw the mantra. If you do not, I will cut off your head and throw it on the ground.’</p>
<p>“Tormented by pain and frightened by the fear of death, the snake charmer revoked the mantra. The hunter immediately killed him. Then, liberated from the mantra that was just like a binding noose, the son of a nāga emerged from the pond, embraced the hunter, and cried out, ‘You are my mother, you are my father! Thanks to you, the pain of separation from my parents did not befall me. Come, let us go to my residence.’</p>
<p>“He took the hunter to his residence, satisfied him with various foods and drinks, gave him jewels, and said to his parents, ‘Father, Mother, this is my ally, protector, and friend. Thanks to him, I escaped being separated from you.’</p>
<p>“They too gave him precious things and various jewels. Taking these things, he left the pond.</p>
<p>“Near the pond, there was a hermitage that was abundant in flowers and fruits, and in which various birds were singing. There lived a ṛṣi who was naturally loving and merciful and affectionate toward beings. The hunter began to visit the ṛṣi three times a day and he told him all that had happened to himself and Janmacitra, the son of a nāga. Then the ṛṣi said to him, ‘What use are the jewels and gold to you? There is a noose called Amogha (Unfailing) in his residence. Ask for it.’</p>
<p>“The hunter then desired the noose Amogha. Having heard the words of the ṛṣi, he again went to the nāga’s residence.  Then he saw the noose Amogha on the gate of the nāga’s residence. He thought, ‘This is the very noose Amogha, which I want,’ and then entered the nāga’s residence. Then Janmacitra, the son of a nāga, along with other nāgas, pleased and entertained him and offered him jewels. He said, ‘I do not need jewels. But give me the noose Amogha.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do you need this?’ asked Janmacitra. ‘We need it desperately to protect ourselves when we are attacked by a garuḍa.’</p>
<p>“The hunter replied, ‘You would need it only when there is harm from a garuḍa, but I need it all the time. Give it to me if you think you have profited and been benefited by me.’</p>
<p>“Janmacitra, the son of a nāga, thought, ‘Since he has greatly benefited me, I will ask my parents for permission and give it to him.’ After asking his parents for permission, he gave him the noose. Thereupon the hunter, happy and satisfied as if he had attained mastery, left the nāga’s residence, taking the noose Amogha with him, and went to his house.</p>
<p>“Later, King Dhana and his consort played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Though they did so, the king produced no son or daughter. He was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, thinking, ‘Although there is such wealth stored up in my home, I have no son or daughter. So after my death, my family lineage will end, my land will be lost, and all my possessions will fall under another king’s control.’</p>
<p>“Śramaṇas, brahmins, companions, friends, and kinsmen asked him, ‘Your Majesty, why  are you plunged into grief?’ He explained the matter to them in detail, and they urged him, ‘Pray to the gods, and you will have a son.’</p>
<p>“ Being sonless and wanting a son, he prayed to Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, Vāsava, and so forth. He also prayed to other special gods, namely, the gods of parks, the gods of forests, the gods of crossroads, the gods of three-forked roads, the gods accepting oblations, and the gods who had been born together with him, who were harmonious with the Dharma, and who always followed him.</p>
<p>“ In this world, it is said that sons and daughters are born on account of prayers, but this is not true. If such a thing were true, each person would have a thousand sons just like a wheel-turning king. Rather, sons and daughters are born because three conditions are satisfied. What are the three? Affected by passion, the parents have intercourse; the mother is at an appropriate time and in her fertile period; and a gandharva is around and wants to enter the womb. When these three conditions are satisfied, sons and daughters are born.</p>
<p>“While the king was thus devoting himself to prayer, a bodhisattva of the fortunate eon entered his chief consort’s womb.</p>
<p>“ A certain kind of woman of an intelligent nature has five special characteristics. What are the five? She knows if a man is affected by passion or free from passion; she knows the appropriate time and menstrual cycle; she knows that the embryo has entered the womb; she knows from whom it has entered; and she knows whether it is a boy or a girl: if it is a boy, it resides on the right side, and if it is a girl, it resides on the left side.</p>
<p>“Being very pleased, she said to her husband, ‘My dear, I am pregnant.  Since the fetus resides on the right side, it is certainly a boy. Be delighted!’</p>
<p>“He too was very pleased. He stretched his upper body, raised his right hand, and spoke an inspired utterance: ‘I will see the face of my son, which I have desired for a long time. May he be born as a suitable son for me, not an unsuitable one. May he take over my work. May he feed me, after having been fed himself. May he inherit my property. May my family lineage last for a long time. When we have died and passed away, may he give donations and make merit for us, either large or small, and assign the rewards of the offerings to our names, saying, “May this go to where those two are reborn and follow them.” ’</p>
<p>“Then, knowing that she was pregnant, he arranged everything so that, until the fetus in the womb was mature, she stayed on the terrace, provided with the requisites for cold when it was cold; the requisites for heat when it was hot; foods prescribed by physicians that were not too bitter, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, or astringent; foods that were free from bitter, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, and astringent ingredients; and short necklaces and long necklaces. With her body covered with ornaments, she moved from one couch to another, from one stool to another, never descending to the ground, as if she were a celestial nymph strolling in the Nandana Grove. She never heard any unpleasant sounds, and she felt free.</p>
<p>“After eight or nine months, she bore a boy who was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, attractive, gold in complexion, with a head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and every major limb and minor appendage of his body complete. When he was born, drums were beaten in celebration. The king heard them and asked,  ‘What is this?’</p>
<p>“Some of the consorts said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, be delighted! Your son has been born.’</p>
<p>“The king then made the entire city comfortable by removing stones, pebbles, and gravel, sprinkling sandalwood water, raising banners and flags, setting out sweet-smelling censers, and scattering various flowers around the city. He ordered, ‘Give donations to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, and the destitute. Release all prisoners.’</p>
<p>“Thus, he held a great celebration at the birth for twenty-one days and, intending to give the child a name, asked, ‘What name shall we give the boy?’</p>
<p>“The ministers said, ‘Since this boy is the son of King Dhana, let us name him Sudhana.’ Thus he was named Sudhana.  The boy Sudhana was entrusted to eight nurses: two nurses to hold the baby on their laps, two nurses to suckle the baby, two nurses to wipe excrement off the baby’s body, and two nurses to play with the baby. The eight nurses raised the baby on milk, fermented milk, butter, butter oil, liquid butter oil, and other special foods, and he soon grew like a lotus that shoots up in a pond.  When he grew up, he was made to learn letters . . . , and he became fully learned in eight kinds of analysis, classification, and reading and became one whose actions are clear.  He became fully learned in the various arts and technical skills of kṣatriyas who have been anointed and have attained dominance, mastery, and sovereignty over the kingdom and have conquered vast lands, namely, riding on the neck of an elephant, riding a horse, handling a chariot, handling a sword and a bow and arrow, retreating and advancing, taming elephants, handling a noose, handling a spear, handling a cudgel, clenching the fist, pacing, cutting, tearing, piercing, and the five arts of shooting, namely, shooting from afar, shooting at a sound, shooting at a vital part, shooting without being noticed, and shooting truly. His father arranged for three types of consorts—older, middling, and younger; built three types of residences for winter,  summer, and the rainy season; and made three types of parks for winter, summer, and the rainy season. Thereupon Prince Sudhana went up to the terrace without male company, and he played, amused himself, and enjoyed himself, to the accompaniment of musical instruments.</p>
<p>“Later, when the hunter Phalaka was wandering around one day looking for deer, he arrived at a certain mountain. At the foot of the mountain, there was a ṛṣi’s hermitage, which was abundant in flowers and fruits, and in which various birds were flying around. There the hunter saw a large pond full of utpala, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers, and adorned with haṃsas, kāraṇḍavas, and cakravākas. He walked around in the hermitage and soon saw a ṛṣi in a garment made of bark, with long hair, beard, nails, and body hair, whose body had been harmed by the wind and heat, living under a certain tree, sitting in a hut made of grass. When he saw him, the hunter bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the ṛṣi. He then made the gesture of supplication and asked, ‘Excellent sir, how long has it been since you settled in this place?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It has been forty years.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If you have lived in this place for such a long time, have you seen or heard of any wonders or marvels here?’</p>
<p>“The calm-natured ṛṣi answered slowly, ‘Sir, do you see this pond?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Excellent sir, I do.’</p>
<p>“ ‘This is the pond named Brahmasabhā. It is full of utpala, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers, and various birds live here. It is full of water the color of snow, silver, and frost, and it is surrounded by sweet-smelling flowers. On the fifteenth day of every month, Manoharā, the daughter of Druma, the king of kinnaras, visits this pond to bathe, surrounded by five hundred kinnarīs, carrying instruments to wash the head and various ointments. When she bathes, even birds and beasts  are enchanted by dance, song, and the sound of music. I too spend seven days with great pleasure and mental satisfaction after having heard that sound. Sir, I have seen this wonder and marvel.’</p>
<p>“Then the hunter Phalaka thought, ‘I have obtained the noose Amogha from the nāga. I will throw it at the kinnarī Manoharā.’</p>
<p>“Later, on the fifteenth day of the month, carrying the noose Amogha, he approached a thicket of flowers, fruits, and leaves near the bank of the pond and stayed there, watching carefully. At that time, surrounded by five hundred kinnarīs, the kinnarī Manoharā majestically approached the lotus pond Brahmasabhā, just as the ṛṣi had described. The hunter Phalaka immediately threw the noose Amogha and caught the kinnarī Manoharā with it. Caught thus by the noose Amogha, she jumped up in the pond and let out a cry of fear. When they heard this, the rest of the kinnarīs began to run about, looking for the kinnarī Manoharā. Then they saw her bound, and they ran away in fear. As the hunter looked at her, who was extremely well proportioned and pleasant to behold, he touched her, trying to grasp her. She said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Vulgar man, you must not touch me.</p>
<p>This is not granted to you.</p>
<p>I am beautiful and suitable for a king,</p>
<p>So it is not right to grasp me.’</p>
<p>“The hunter said, ‘If I do not grasp you, you will run away.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will not run away,’ she replied. ‘If you do not believe me, take this crest jewel by which I fly in the sky.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Who knows what you will do?’ retorted the hunter.</p>
<p>“She gave him the crest jewel and said, ‘I will obey him in whose hand this crest jewel lies.’</p>
<p>“Then the hunter took the jewel and departed, taking her along, still caught in the noose.</p>
<p>“At that time,  Prince Sudhana came hunting. The hunter saw Prince Sudhana, well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. When he saw him, he thought, ‘This is a prince, and this is a woman who is extremely well proportioned and pleasant to behold. If he sees her, he will take her by force. I will now voluntarily give her to him as a present.’</p>
<p>“Then he brought her bound with rope to Prince Sudhana. When he arrived, he threw himself at the prince’s feet and said, ‘Your Highness, I present this treasured woman as a gift to you. Please take her.’</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana saw that the kinnarī Manoharā was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, attractive, had a perfect complexion, had collected every good quality, was adorned with the eighteen female characteristics, and was more beautiful than anyone in the country. Her breasts were ample, hanging down like golden pots or tortoises, robust and solid, round and full. Her eyes were jet black, bloodshot, and long, and they were shaped like lotus buds. Her nose was long and prominent. Her lower lip was just like coral, a jewel, or a bimba fruit. Her cheeks were not hollow but plump. The upper parts of her cheeks were adorned with very lovely marks. Her eyebrows were smoothly arched, close, and as black as a cluster of bees. Her shoulders were round like a spotless full moon, and her arms were long. Her belly was deeply creased with three lines and slightly protruding. She slightly stooped from the weight of her breasts. Her waist was beautifully shaped like a part of a chariot. Her hands were soft like the pith of the plantain tree. Her thighs were tapering, round, and beautiful. Her every limb was smooth and beautiful, with no vein standing out. She proudly walked with the sounds of a jeweled headdress, a choker, anklets, bracelets, short necklaces, and long necklaces.  Her hair was black and soft. Her feet were adorned with anklets just like Śacī, the wife of Indra. She was wearing a golden belt around her slim waist. Many short necklaces hung down from her neck. The color of her skin was beautiful like molten gold.</p>
<p>“As soon as he saw her, the prince was caught firmly by the noose of lust, which is as hard to hold as a spotless, clear, and trembling moon reflected in water; is as hard to recognize as a makara in a wavy river; flies swiftly like a garuḍa or the wind; changes quickly like rolling cotton; and moves about busily like a monkey without stopping anywhere.</p>
<p>“Having his heart pierced by the arrow of lust, it gave a sound of the utmost secret of desire for union, having been shot with the bow of improper mental attention because of attachment to a beautiful one by a mind that was deeply stained. His heart adhering to defilement through perpetual repetition, he was eager to taste the pleasure of lust and, dashing for the cliff, danger, and precipice because of all defilements, he fell down there just like a moth flying into the fire. And so it is said:</p>
<p>“Sudhana saw her, who was just like lightning flashing through a cloud in the rainy season,</p>
<p>And whose face was just like the moon.</p>
<p>His heart was struck by the arrow of lust,</p>
<p>Which was released by frolicking in desirous attachment to her.</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana took Manoharā to the city of Hastināpura and gave the hunter an excellent village. Thereupon Prince Sudhana went up to the terrace with Manoharā, and they played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Manoharā enchanted Prince Sudhana with her good qualities—her beauty, youth, and hundreds of kinds of service—so that his thoughts never left her.</p>
<p>“Later, one day, two brahmins came from another province. One of them served the king,  and the other Prince Sudhana. The one who served the king was appointed chief priest and given an allotment. The one who served Prince Sudhana was only given an allotment by him. ‘Your Highness,’ he asked, ‘what will you do for me when your father passes away and you are enthroned?’</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana answered, ‘I will appoint you my chief priest just as the brahmin who is your friend was appointed my father’s chief priest.’</p>
<p>“The rumor passed from mouth to mouth, and the brahmin chief priest heard it. He thought, ‘I will prevent the prince from attaining the throne, let alone that brahmin from being appointed chief priest.’</p>
<p>“Later, the chief of a certain hamlet in the kingdom revolted against the king. The king sent troops to conquer him, but they came back defeated, beaten, vanquished. He sent troops seven times altogether, but they came back defeated, beaten, vanquished. The ministers said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, why do you damage your own army and strengthen the enemy’s? Please summon all the people living by the sword in Your Majesty’s land.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin chief priest thought, ‘Now it is the time to devise a plan to kill Prince Sudhana.’ He said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, you cannot conquer them in that way.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What should I do? Should I myself go there?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Why should Your Majesty yourself go?’ the chief priest asked in return. ‘This Prince Sudhana is young and possessed of power and pride. Send him with these troops.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I should do so,’ said the king.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the king summoned the prince and ordered him, ‘O Prince, go with the troops and conquer the people of that hamlet.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’  replied Prince Sudhana, and he went to the harem. When he saw Manoharā, however, he forgot everything. Thereupon he was again ordered by the king, but as soon as he saw her, he again forgot everything. Then the chief priest said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, Prince Sudhana is so attached to Manoharā that he cannot leave. Prepare the troops. When the prince comes out from the harem, prevent him from going to Manoharā and dispatch him.’</p>
<p>“The king ordered the ministers, ‘Sirs, prepare an army.’</p>
<p>“Having accepted the king’s order, the ministers prepared an army consisting of divisions of elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry and equipped with various kinds of requisites and weapons. Then, when the prince came out, the king ordered him, ‘O Prince, the army is prepared. Go.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I will see Manoharā and then go,’ he replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘O Prince,’ said the king, ‘she will be an obstacle, so you should not see her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Father, if so, I will see my mother and then go.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Prince, do go see your mother.’</p>
<p>“He went to his mother, bringing Manoharā’s crest jewel. He threw himself at her feet and said, ‘Mother, I will go to conquer the people of that hamlet. Please conceal this crest jewel in a hidden place and do not give it to Manoharā unless she is in danger of death.’</p>
<p>“Having made this request of his mother, he said goodbye and left with the army amid the sounds of various musical instruments. He passed in due course through various provinces and then stayed under a tree near the hamlet.</p>
<p>“At that time, Great King Vaiśravaṇa set out with his attendants along a path for a meeting of yakṣas, who were quite numerous—hundreds of yakṣas, thousands of yakṣas, hundreds of thousands of yakṣas. When he set out along the path,  he was blocked in the air. He thought, ‘I have passed along this path many times, and my vehicle has never been blocked. What has blocked me now? What is the cause of this?’</p>
<p>“He saw Prince Sudhana and thought, ‘This is the bodhisattva of the fortunate eon. He will be distressed about going into battle. I will help him and conquer the people of the hamlet without harming any living being.’</p>
<p>“He said to Pāñcika, the great general of yakṣas, ‘Come, Pāñcika, you should conquer the people of the hamlet without harming any living being, even before Prince Sudhana begins to fight the people of the hamlet.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly,’ replied Pāñcika, the great general of yakṣas, to Great King Vaiśravaṇa, and he created a divine army consisting of four divisions: men as large as palm trees, elephants as large as mountains, horses as large as elephants, and chariots as large as heavenly vehicles. Then, in a terrifying display of various weapons such as swords, clubs, lances, missiles, chakras, darts, arrows, axes, and so forth, as well as the sounds of various musical instruments, Pāñcika arrived at the hamlet with the great army. Its wall was destroyed by the sound of the elephants, horses, and chariots, the sounds of various musical instruments, and the power of the yakṣas themselves. The dwellers of the hamlet saw the army and the broken wall and, much astonished, they asked, ‘Where did this army come from?’</p>
<p>“Then they said, ‘Open the gate quickly. Prince Sudhana is coming after this. This army belongs to him. If you do not open the gate quickly, everything will be destroyed.’</p>
<p>“They added:</p>
<p>“ ‘We will not rebel against the king,</p>
<p>Nor against the intelligent prince.</p>
<p>By the king’s men</p>
<p>We are frightened and terrified.’</p>
<p>“They opened the gate and then they raised banners and flags, filled vessels, and welcomed Prince Sudhana with the sounds of various musical instruments. He set them at ease and pleased them. He appointed a chief, assessed the tax, and took their property as security. Then, having defeated the hamlet, Prince Sudhana went home.</p>
<p>“That very night, King Dhana dreamed that a vulture came, tore the king’s stomach open, pulled out his intestines, and surrounded the entire city with them, and that seven treasures came to his residence. Having dreamed these things, the king sprang to his feet and sat on his large bed, frightened and dejected, with the hairs in every pore of his body standing on end. He was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand, asking himself, ‘Is there a chance I will lose my throne or be in danger of death because of this?’</p>
<p>“When the night had passed, he talked to the brahmin chief priest. The brahmin thought, ‘That the king had such a dream certainly means that the prince has conquered the hamlet. I shall tell him a lie.’ He said, ‘Your Majesty, you had an inauspicious dream. Certainly, you will lose your throne or be in danger of death because of this. However, there is a means to prevent this. It is seen in the lore of brahmanical mantras.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What is the means to prevent it?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, build a well-shaped pond of a certain size in a park. Then paint the pond with an application of lime, clean it well, and fill it with the blood of smaller animals. Then, when Your Majesty bathes, you must enter the pond by one staircase. After entering by one, you must ascend another. After entering by the second, you must ascend a third.  After entering by the third, you must ascend a fourth. After this, four brahmins who have mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas should lick Your Majesty’s feet with their tongues and burn incense made from kinnara fat. Doing this, Your Majesty will be purified of your sins and protect your kingdom for a long time.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I can do all this,’ said the king, ‘but kinnara fat is very difficult to obtain.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, is it difficult to obtain what is right here?’ asked the chief priest.</p>
<p>“ ‘What do you mean?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ said the chief priest, ‘is this Manoharā not a kinnarī?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Chief priest, do not say that,’ said the king, ‘for she is the prince’s life.’</p>
<p>“The chief priest asked, ‘Your Majesty, have you never heard this?</p>
<p>“ ‘You should abandon a person for a home,</p>
<p>Abandon a home for a village,</p>
<p>Abandon a village for a country,</p>
<p>And the world for the Self.</p>
<p>“ ‘O King, keeping yourself firm,</p>
<p>Confer another woman</p>
<p>Upon the intelligent prince</p>
<p>And kill this Manoharā.’</p>
<p>“There is nothing one attached to himself cannot do. The king agreed. Thereupon he began to do as the chief priest had instructed. A pond was dug, painted with an application of lime, and cleaned well, and it was filled with the blood of smaller animals. Learning of these preparations, Sudhana’s consorts were pleased and satisfied and said, ‘Since we are endowed with youth and beauty, we and Prince Sudhana will now play, make love, and enjoy ourselves.’</p>
<p>“Manoharā saw them pleased and asked, ‘Why are you so pleased?’</p>
<p>“Then someone explained to Manoharā in detail what had happened. Full of pain and despair, Manoharā went to Prince Sudhana’s mother. She threw herself at her feet  and informed her of the matter slowly, in a piteous voice. The mother said, ‘If this is so, look into it thoroughly. So will I.’</p>
<p>“Manoharā looked into it and reported back. The mother looked into it too, and it seemed to be true. Then she gave the crest jewel and garment to Manoharā and said, ‘Daughter, you should not leave until it is time so that I will not be blamed.’</p>
<p>“And so the king went bathing, going through all the procedures he had been taught. He entered the pond filled with blood and returned to land. Thereupon brahmins licked his feet with their tongues. Then he ordered, ‘Bring the kinnarī.’ Manoharā immediately soared up into the air and spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘I have touched and met him.</p>
<p>I have laughed and played with him.</p>
<p>But, just like a she-elephant unbound,</p>
<p>I will now depart.’</p>
<p>“The king saw her fly off through the air. Frightened, he said to the chief priest, ‘The kinnarī Manoharā has fled, while the purpose for which we have made all this effort has not yet been accomplished.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ said the chief priest, ‘the purpose is now accomplished, and you are free from sin.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Manoharā thought, flying through the air, ‘All my falling into these circumstances began when that ṛṣi spoke of me. If he had not spoken, I would not have been caught. So, I will first go to that ṛṣi.’</p>
<p>“She went to his hermitage, and after paying homage at his feet, she said to the ṛṣi, ‘O great ṛṣi, in consequence of your speaking of me, I was caught, touched by a human, and narrowly avoided death. Therefore, I ask you, if Prince Sudhana at some point comes here in search of me, give him this ring and say this: “O Prince, the way is difficult and exhausting. Turn back.”  If he does not turn back, you should tell him the way: “O Prince, Manoharā said this: ‘There are three black mountains in the north, another three beyond them, and another three beyond them. And then beyond them, there is the Himalaya, the king of mountains. To its north lies Mount Utkīlaka, and Kūjaka Jalapatha, Khadiraka, Ekadhāraka, Vajraka, Kāmarūpin, Utkīlaka,Airāvataka, Avevāṇa, and Pramokṣa. Go over these mountains. Among them, Mounts Khadhiraka, Ekadhāraka, and Utkīlaka are to be entered through caves, and Vajraka by the king of birds. You should cross the mountains by these means. You should defeat the magical contraptions, which are the one with a goat-like face, the one like a sheep, and the man shaped like a yellow rākṣasa. There is a snake with a great stream of saliva, swimming in a cave. You should destroy it with courage.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘When you see a black snake</p>
<p>Sitting in the middle of the cave,</p>
<p>Bend your bow, shoot an arrow,</p>
<p>And kill it for me.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘When you see two sheep</p>
<p>Colliding with one another,</p>
<p>Cut the horns off of both,</p>
<p>And you will find a way.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘When you see two iron men</p>
<p>Who cause great fear holding swords,</p>
<p>Hit one of them,</p>
<p>And you will find a way.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘When you see a rākṣasī with iron lips</p>
<p>Opening and closing her mouth,</p>
<p>Then into her forehead</p>
<p>Drive wedges.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘Also, you should jump</p>
<p>Across a violently swirling sixty-hasta well.</p>
<p>Drawing your bow to the full,</p>
<p>Kill a yakṣa and a rākṣasa</p>
<p>With yellow hair and eyes like a lion,</p>
<p>Who are dreadful and difficult to approach.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘Cross many rivers</p>
<p>Full of crocodiles and alligators,</p>
<p>Namely, the Naṅgā, Pataṅgā, Tapanī,</p>
<p>Citrā, Rudanī, Hasanī,</p>
<p>Āśīviṣā, and Vetranadī.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘There are angry rākṣasīs in the Naṅgā,</p>
<p>Demons in the Pataṅgā,</p>
<p>Many alligators in the Tapanī,</p>
<p>Beings assuming any shape at will in the Citrā,</p>
<p>A female servant of kinnarīs in the Rudanī,</p>
<p>A daughter-in-law of kinnarīs in the Hasanī,</p>
<p>Many snakes in the Āśīviṣā,</p>
<p>And śālmali trees in the Vetranadī.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘You should behave confidently in the Naṅgā,</p>
<p>Take courage in the Pataṅgā,</p>
<p>And tie the mouths of the alligators in the Tapanī.</p>
<p>Cross the Citrā by means of various songs,</p>
<p>The Rudanī with satisfaction,</p>
<p>And the Hasanī in silence.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘Cross the Āśīviṣā by means of</p>
<p>The charm against snakebite</p>
<p>And the Vetranadī by</p>
<p>Striking with a sharp weapon.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “ ‘Having crossed the rivers, with composure defeat the five hundred yakṣas on the lookout. Then, the palace of the king of kinnaras is there.’ ” ’</p>
<p>“After she had thus spoken to the ṛṣi, Manoharā paid homage at his feet and departed.</p>
<p>“Later, the king heard that Prince Sudhana had conquered the hamlet and come back to the city of Hastināpura, bringing presents, and he was very pleased. After the prince was fully rested, he went to his father, greeted him, and sat down in front of him. The king spoke to him in an extremely pleasing manner. ‘O Prince,’ he inquired, ‘did you come back safely?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, thanks to you, the chief of the hamlet was conquered, their property was taken as security, and a new chief was appointed. Here are also taxes and presents. Accept them for your storehouse.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son, you did a good job. I will accept them,’ said the king.</p>
<p>“Then the prince expressed to his father his wish to leave. The king said, ‘O Prince, stay here so we might enjoy the presents together.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I have not seen Manoharā for a long time, and so I will go.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Prince, do not leave today—leave tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“He insisted, saying, ‘Father, I must certainly go today.’</p>
<p>“The king remained silent. Then the prince went to his residence. Seeing that the door of the consorts’ palace had lost its radiance, he anxiously entered, but he did not see Manoharā. Dazed and wandering around, he cried, ‘Manoharā! Manoharā!’</p>
<p>“Then the consorts gathered and gossiped about her. With his heart tormented, he asked all of them about this, and they explained exactly what had happened. He was stupefied with sorrow. The women said to him, ‘Your Highness, there are women much more excellent than her in this harem. Why are you so sad?’</p>
<p>“Having learned that his father was ungrateful, he went to his mother, threw himself at her feet, and lamented, ‘Mother,</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not see Manoharā,</p>
<p>Who is possessed of desirable qualities</p>
<p>And is perfect in beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>Where has my Manoharā gone?</p>
<p>“ ‘I am running about, driven by my mind (manas);</p>
<p>My mind is utterly perplexed.</p>
<p>Because I have been parted from her,</p>
<p>My heart grieves bitterly.</p>
<p>“ ‘Manoharā, who would please my mind, engross my mind (manoharā),</p>
<p>Delight my mind, and gladden my mind—</p>
<p>Because I have been parted from her, my body is seized with pain.</p>
<p>Where does this pain of mine come from?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son,’ she said, ‘Manoharā experienced unbearable pain and fear, so I released her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, how did this happen?’</p>
<p>“She related in detail all that had happened. He said, ‘My father is merciless and ungrateful.’ And then he asked, ‘Mother, where did she go? By which way?’</p>
<p>“She said, ‘Son,</p>
<p>“ ‘The way by which Manoharā went</p>
<p>Is the mountain</p>
<p>Where ṛṣis and lions always dwell</p>
<p>And the king of the Dharma lives.’</p>
<p>“Unable to bear the pain of separation from Manoharā,  he became weary and again lamented in a piteous voice:</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not see Manoharā,</p>
<p>Who is possessed of desirable qualities</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>Where does this pain of mine come from?’</p>
<p>“Then his mother said to him, ‘Son, there are women much more excellent than her in this harem. Why are you so sad?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother,’ replied the prince, ‘so long as I do not have her, with whom would I be pleased?’</p>
<p>“She tried to soothe him, but he kept grieving with sorrow. He began to wander, seeking Manoharā’s whereabouts. He then hit on a good idea: ‘I will first ask the very man from whom I obtained her.’ And so he went to the hunter Phalaka and demanded, ‘From whom did you obtain Manoharā?’</p>
<p>“ ‘There lives a ṛṣi at the foot of a mountain called such-and-such,’ he replied, ‘and there is a lotus pond named Brahmasabhā in his hermitage. She came to bathe there. The ṛṣi told me this, and so I obtained her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will now go to the ṛṣi,’ thought the prince. ‘I will discover her whereabouts from him.’</p>
<p>“The king heard a rumor that the prince was utterly stupefied because of his separation from Manoharā. Then the king asked him, ‘O Prince, why should you be stupefied? I will soon give you a wife more excellent than her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Father,’ he answered, ‘I cannot be with my harem without her.’</p>
<p>“Although the king told him the same thing many times, the prince would not change his mind. Then the king installed guards at the city gate and city wall, lest the prince try to escape by those means. The prince remained awake throughout the night. These five kinds of beings are said to sleep little at night—to hardly sleep at all. What five? They are said to be a man bound up by attachment to a woman, a woman bound up by attachment to a man, a being that is a red wild duck, the chief of thieves, and a monk who is striving.</p>
<p>“Thereupon  the prince thought, ‘If I go through the king’s gate, there are fierce guards watching over it, and they will cut me in punishment or kill me. I will now go by any means along the path where there are no guards.’</p>
<p>“He rose that night, tied the garland of blue utpalas that had been fastened to his head to a banner, and descended where there were no guards. Then the moon came out. When he saw the moon, he chanted a lamentation about his separation from Manoharā thus:</p>
<p>“ ‘O full moon, king of celestial bodies, illuminator of the night,</p>
<p>O wise caravan leader, you are beloved to the eyes of Rohiṇī, your wife.</p>
<p>Did you see Manoharā, my beloved, whose eyes are like utpalas,</p>
<p>Anywhere on the face of the earth?’</p>
<p>“He then proceeded, remembering the joy he had experienced before. He saw a doe and said to her, too:</p>
<p>“ ‘O doe, you eat grass and leaves and drink water.</p>
<p>May fortune be with you! Feel at ease. I am not a hunter.</p>
<p>Did you see my beautiful Manoharā,</p>
<p>Whose large eyes are like a doe’s?’</p>
<p>“He left there and arrived at a certain other place. Seeing bees playing in the middle of a forest adorned with flowers and fruits, he said to a bee:</p>
<p>“ ‘O best of bees like a dark-colored mountain,</p>
<p>Who inhabits bamboo joints and lotuses,</p>
<p>Did you see my Manoharā,</p>
<p>Whose long locks are as black as a bee?’</p>
<p>“He left that place, too, and when he saw a snake, he said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O black snake, who breathes out a cloud of smoke from your eyes and mouth,</p>
<p>With your tongue quivering like the leaf of a tree,</p>
<p>Your poisonous fire does not resemble the fire of passion.</p>
<p>Did you see my Manoharā?’</p>
<p>“Thereupon he went to another place. When he saw a cuckoo  singing in a certain forest, he said to the cuckoo, too:</p>
<p>“ ‘O cuckoo, who lives in a tree in the best forest,</p>
<p>King of birds, who engrosses the minds (manoharā) of women,</p>
<p>Did you see my Manoharā,</p>
<p>Whose eyes are spotless and beautiful like blue utpalas?’</p>
<p>“He left that place, too, and saw a tree called aśoka, ‘without sorrow,’ full of blossoms.</p>
<p>“ ‘O one whose name is said to be auspicious,</p>
<p>Who is the great king of trees,</p>
<p>I, stupefied by sorrow for Manoharā,</p>
<p>Make the gesture of supplication to you. May you remove my sorrow!’</p>
<p>“Thus stupefied, he arrived in due course at the ṛṣi’s hermitage. Having politely greeted the ṛṣi, he said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O patient one dressed in a garment of bark and antelope skin,</p>
<p>Who eats roots, shoots, and fruits of the āmalaka, vilva, and kapittha,</p>
<p>O ṛṣi, I greet you, bowing down. Did you see</p>
<p>My Manoharā? May you tell me quickly!’</p>
<p>“Then the ṛṣi said ‘Welcome’ to Prince Sudhana, made the salutation to be made first, giving him a seat and so forth, and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘I did see her, whose eyebrows were soft and dark colored, whose appearance was pleasant to behold and agreeable,</p>
<p>Whose face was just like the full moon and whose eyes were just like blue utpalas.</p>
<p>Sir, you should relax your mind and eat various roots and fruits,</p>
<p>Which will later keep you going. There is no doubt in my mind about this.</p>
<p>“ ‘The woman with beautiful eyebrows said this:</p>
<p>“Prince, I am distressed with craving for you.</p>
<p>Those who live in the forest suffer greatly, too.</p>
<p>If you proceed, certainly you will see me.”</p>
<p>“ ‘She gave me this ring and said, “Say to him, ‘The way is difficult and exhausting. Turn back.’ If he cannot turn back, you should tell him the way.”  Then, she said this: “There are three black mountains in the north, another three beyond them, and another three beyond them. And then beyond them, there is the Himalaya, the king of mountains.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “You should obtain these medicines from that place. There is a medicine called sūdayā; you should boil it with ghee and drink it. This will free you from thirst and hunger and improve your memory and physical strength. You should also look for a monkey. You should also learn mantras. You should have a bow and arrows, luminous jewels, an antidote to counteract the effects of poison, three iron wedges, and a lute.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “To the north of the Himalaya, the king of mountains, lies Mount Utkīlaka, and Kūjaka Jalapatha, Khadiraka, Ekadhāraka, Vajraka, Kāmarūpin, Utkīlaka, Airāvataka, Avevāṇa, and Pramokṣa. You have to cross these mountains. Among them, enter Mount Khadiraka through a cave. Ekadhāraka and Utkīlaka are also to be entered through caves, and Vajraka by the king of birds. You should cross the mountains by these means. You should defeat the magical contraptions, which are the one with a goat-like face, the one like a sheep, and the man shaped like a yellow rākṣasa. There is a snake with a great stream of saliva, swimming in a cave. You should destroy it with courage.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “When you see a black snake</p>

<p>“ ‘ “Also, you should jump</p>
<p>Across a violently swirling sixty-hasta well.</p>
<p>Drawing your bow to the full,</p>
<p>Kill a yakṣa and a rākṣasa</p>
<p>With yellow hair and eyes like a lion,</p>
<p>Who are dreadful and difficult to approach.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “You should cross many rivers</p>
<p>Full of crocodiles and alligators,</p>
<p>Namely, the Naṅgā, Pataṅgā, Tapanī,</p>
<p>Citrā, Rudanī, Hasanī,</p>
<p>Āśīviṣā, and Vetranadī.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “There are angry rākṣasīs in the Naṅgā,</p>
<p>Demons in the Pataṅgā,</p>
<p>Many alligators in the Tapanī,</p>
<p>Beings assuming any shape at will in the Citrā,</p>
<p>A female servant of kinnarīs in the Rudanī,</p>
<p>A daughter-in-law of kinnarīs in the Hasanī,</p>

<p>And śālmali trees in the Vetranadī.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “You should behave confidently in the Naṅgā,</p>

<p>Striking with a sharp weapon.</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Having crossed the rivers, with composure defeat the five hundred yakṣas on the lookout. Then, the palace of the king of kinnaras is there.” ’</p>
<p>“And so, in order to look for the medicines, mantras, and antidote as instructed, Prince Sudhana bowed low until his forehead touched the ṛṣi’s feet, and then departed. He prepared everything as instructed except a monkey. Then, taking everything with him, he went to the ṛṣi again. The ṛṣi gave him a monkey and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Prince, what use are these efforts?</p>
<p>Why is this Manoharā so needed?</p>
<p>You are alone, without any companion.</p>
<p>Since you will suffer from physical danger, give this up.’</p>
<p>“The prince replied, ‘Great ṛṣi, I will certainly go. Why?</p>
<p>Where does the moon moving in the sky have a companion?</p>
<p>Where does the king of beasts possessed of the power and strength of its fangs,</p>
<p>Or a fire burning the forest, have a companion?</p>
<p>What is the need for a powerful companion to a man like me?</p>
<p>“ ‘Why should I not take to the great ocean?</p>
<p>Why should I not heal myself, when I was bitten by a snake?</p>
<p>I will make great efforts, those on which beings of vigor have relied.</p>
<p>If I fail, having exerted myself, there is no fault in this.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Prince Sudhana departed, carrying everything as instructed by Manoharā. In due course, he conquered mountains, rivers, caves, pits, and so forth, with medicines, mantras, and the antidote, and arrived near the city of Druma, the king of kinnaras. The prince saw the prosperous city adorned with a beautiful park full of various flowers and fruits, inhabited by various birds. There were ponds and long square lakes there, where kinnarīs were wandering about. When he saw kinnarīs come there to draw water, Prince Sudhana asked them, ‘What are you doing with this much water?’</p>
<p>“They answered, ‘There is a daughter of Druma, the king of kinnaras, who is called Manoharā. Since she was caught by human hands, we are going to wash the human smell off her.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do you pour water over her from all these jars at once or one by one?’ asked Prince Sudhana.</p>
<p>“ ‘One by one,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“He thought, ‘Here is a good device. I will put this signet ring in a jar.’ He put it in a jar held by a certain kinnarī, without being noticed,  and said to the kinnarī, ‘Bathe Manoharā first with this jar of yours.’</p>
<p>“ ‘There is certainly something important to this,’ she thought.</p>
<p>“When she poured water over Manoharā’s head with that jar first, the signet ring fell on her lap. Manoharā was puzzled by this. She then asked the kinnarī, ‘Has some human come here?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, he has,’ she replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘Go and conceal him in a hidden place.’</p>
<p>“She took him inside the palace and concealed him in a hidden place. Then Manoharā threw herself at her father’s feet and asked, ‘Father, if that Prince Sudhana, who was my husband, comes here, what will you do to him?’</p>
<p>“ ‘He is a human, and I have no use for him,’ he answered. ‘I will tear him asunder and scatter his body in every direction.’</p>
<p>“Manoharā then said to him, ‘Father, how else does a human come here? I myself told him to do so.’</p>
<p>“Then Druma, the king of kinnaras, completely calmed his anger. When he had completely calmed his anger, he said, ‘If the prince comes, I will adorn you with every ornament, surround you with many treasures, requisites, and a thousand kinnarīs, and give you to him.’</p>
<p>“Pleased, delighted, and gladdened, Manoharā then adorned Prince Sudhana with divine ornaments and showed him to Druma, the king of kinnaras. Thus Druma, the king of kinnaras, saw Prince Sudhana, well proportioned, attractive, pleasant to behold, and endowed with a perfect complexion. Upon seeing him, he felt extreme wonder. Then, intending to test the prince, he set out seven golden trees, seven palm trees, seven drums, and seven boars.</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana was a bodhisattva, and bodhisattvas are experts in the arts and technical skills.  Also, the gods make efforts to remove obstacles from them. And so the bodhisattva danced, sang, and played musical instruments of various sounds provided by deities, such as a lute, gong, harp, three-stringed lute, clay drum, and so forth. Surrounded by thousands of kinnaras, he held a sword just like a blue utpala petal. Beheld by Druma, the king of kinnaras, he went to a golden tree and cut the tree asunder as if it were a plantain, rendering it into pieces as small as sesame seeds. He shot through the seven palm trees, seven drums, and seven boars with an arrow, and stood immovable like Mount Sumeru. Then the gods in the sky and hundreds of thousands of kinnaras let out a great cry of laughter: ‘Hāhā!’ Having seen and heard this, Druma, the king of kinnaras, felt wonder. Then he had Manoharā mingle with a thousand kinnarīs who looked identical to her and said to Prince Sudhana, ‘O Prince, now find Manoharā.’</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana spoke a verse in order to distinguish her from the others:</p>
<p>“ ‘If you are my beloved, Manoharā,</p>
<p>Just as you are the daughter of Druma,</p>
<p>By this truth, quick,</p>
<p>Manoharā, take a step quickly.</p>
<p>“Then she immediately took a step. The kinnarīs said, ‘Your Majesty, this Prince Sudhana is possessed of power, effort, and courage and is suitable for Manoharā. Why do you mock him? Give Manoharā to him.’</p>
<p>“Then, as the kinnaras praised the prince, Druma, the king of kinnaras, in accordance with the kinnaras’ wishes,  offered great honor to Prince Sudhana. He adorned Manoharā with divine ornaments and, holding her with his left hand and taking a golden pitcher in his right hand, went to Prince Sudhana and said, ‘O Prince, I give you this Manoharā surrounded by a thousand kinnarīs, as your wife. Although humans are not steadfast, you must not abandon her, no matter what.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Father,’ replied Prince Sudhana to Druma, the king of kinnaras. He and Manoharā played, made love, and enjoyed themselves to the accompaniment of musical instruments, without male company, in the residence of the kinnaras.</p>
<p>“Later, he remembered his own country and grieved with sorrow because of the great pain of separation from his parents. He said to Manoharā, ‘I am overwhelmed by the great pain of separation from my parents.’</p>
<p>“Manoharā then explained in detail to her father what had happened. He said, ‘Go with the prince. Since humans are deceitful, though, you must be careful.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Druma, the king of kinnaras, gave the prince many jewels and pearls and much gold.</p>
<p>“The prince flew with Manoharā through the air by the power possessed by kinnaras and arrived in due course at the city of Hastināpura. Then the city of Hastināpura was made comfortable by removing stones, pebbles, and gravel, sprinkling sandalwood water, hanging many silk tassels, raising banners and flags, setting sweet-smelling censers out, and scattering flowers. Surrounded by thousands of human kings, the prince with Manoharā then entered the city of Hastināpura. After he was fully rested,  he went to his father, bringing various treasures. He sat down by the king’s seat and explained in detail how he had gone to and come back from the city of kinnaras. Thereupon King Dhana knew that he was possessed of power, effort, and courage and anointed him as king.</p>
<p>“Prince Sudhana thought, ‘It is from a special cause established in the past that I have been united with Manoharā and attained kingship. I will now again give donations and make merit.’ He made limitless offerings in the city of Hastināpura for twelve years.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that prince called Sudhana at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the king called Sudhana at that time, on that occasion, when I performed a bodhisattva’s deeds. I did not attain supreme and complete awakening only because I showed power, effort, and courage for Manoharā and made limitless offerings for twelve years, however; these donations and efforts were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>10. Viśvantara</p>
<p>a. Viśvantara’s Story I</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a king named Viśvāmitra in a city called Viśvapurī.  In accordance with the Dharma, he ruled over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, where there was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, . . . .</p>
<p>“One day, he and his consort played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, and thus the consort conceived a child. After eight or nine months, a boy was born. He was well proportioned, attractive, pleasant to behold, gold in complexion, with a head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose . . . . He became fully learned in the five arts . . . .</p>
<p>“Prince Viśvantara was pious, good, and of a virtuous disposition. He benefited himself and others. He was merciful, a great individual who wished for the Dharma, and he was loving to beings. He offered everything, gave everything, gave without attachment, and engaged himself in great donations. Having heard of his huge donations, seekers came from even a hundred yojanas away, and everyone was given something, their wishes satisfied.</p>
<p>“One day, the bodhisattva mounted the most excellent chariot, one glittering with jewels, gold, silver, diamonds, lapis lazuli, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires; made with a core of the best sandalwood, covered with the skins of a lion, tiger, and leopard; that ran as fast as the wind; and pulled by four horses sounding small golden and silver bells. He traveled in it from the most excellent city to a park.</p>
<p>“Then certain brahmins who had mastered the Vedas and auxiliary branches of the Vedas saw Viśvantara and greeted him: ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!’ They also said:</p>
<p>“ ‘All over the world, you are</p>
<p>Renowned as Sarvaṃdada, “Giver of Everything.”</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you to give this chariot</p>
<p>As a donation to brahmins.’</p>
<p>“Having been told this, the bodhisattva Viśvantara quickly descended from the chariot. With his heart pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he gave the chariot to the brahmins and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I give the chariot</p>
<p>To brahmins with great pleasure,</p>
<p>May I give away everything in the three realms of existence</p>
<p>And attain supreme awakening.’</p>
<p>“Later, when spring came, he mounted the most excellent elephant, named Rājyavardhana, whose color was white like flowers such as jasmine and white water lily, snow, silver, and white clouds; whose body was well supported in its seven parts; whose feet were well supported, and who walked majestically like the elephant Airāvaṇa, was adorned with the best characteristics, and was auspicious to behold. He went to a park in a forest where the trees were budding, and birds such as haṃsas, curlews, peacocks, parrots, hill mynas, cuckoos, and jīvaṃjīvakas were singing, followed by his favorite slaves, friends, and servants like the moon surrounded by stars.</p>
<p>“Then, certain brahmins sent by an enemy quickly approached Prince Viśvantara and greeted him: ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!’ They also said:</p>
<p>“ ‘All over the world, including among the asuras and gods,</p>
<p>You are renowned as Sarvaṃdada, “Giver of Everything.”</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you</p>
<p>To give this most excellent elephant to us.’</p>
<p>“Having been told this, the bodhisattva quickly dismounted from that most excellent elephant. With his mind pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he gave the best elephant to them and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I give this most excellent elephant</p>
<p>To brahmins with great pleasure,</p>
<p>May I give away everything in the three realms of existence</p>
<p>And attain supreme awakening.’</p>
<p>“King Viśvāmitra heard it said, ‘Your son Viśvantara gave the most excellent elephant, named Rājyavardhana, to the brahmins sent by our enemies.’ When he had heard this, King Viśvāmitra trembled with intense anger, summoned Prince Viśvantara, and shouted, ‘O Prince, you should not stay in my country. Go away!’</p>
<p>“Having been abandoned by his father, Prince Viśvantara then thought, ‘Because I have been exerting myself for awakening and have put on the armor of effort in order to accept the whole world as my followers, I gave even that elephant.</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus, living at home,</p>
<p>I have given as many donations as I could.</p>
<p>Dwelling in the forest of ascetics,</p>
<p>I should certainly do my best.</p>
<p>“ ‘If begged, I cannot say the words</p>
<p>“I will not give.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I will relinquish my house</p>
<p>And go to the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“Having made up his mind, the bodhisattva went to his wife, Mādrī, and explained these matters in detail. As soon as she heard them, Mādrī made the gesture of supplication, and then said to the bodhisattva, with her heart fearing separation from her husband, ‘My dear, if so, I too will go to the forest of ascetics. Being apart from you, I would not be able to live even for one moment. Why?</p>
<p>“ ‘The sky without the moon,</p>
<p>The earth without crops,</p>
<p>And a lotus without water:</p>
<p>Such is a woman without her husband.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva said, ‘We will certainly part in the end. That is the nature of the world. Since you have been used to the best food, drink, bedding, and clothing, your body  is very delicate. In the forest of ascetics, you have to lie on grass and leaves, eat roots, flowers, and fruits, walk on the ground full of darbha grass, stones, other kinds of grass, and thorns, rely always upon only one meal a day, and expose yourself to public scrutiny. You have to exert yourself to venerate every sudden guest. Even there, I will certainly give as many donations as I can. You should never regret this. Therefore, give it adequate thought now.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear,’ Mādrī replied, ‘I will follow you with all my might.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva said to her, ‘If so, you should remember this promise.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the bodhisattva went to his father. He bowed and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Father, master of the earth, please forgive me for my fault,</p>
<p>Which was my giving the great elephant as a donation.</p>
<p>I will leave the city and go to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Your storehouse, O master of the people, will not become empty.</p>
<p>“Then the king gasped with the pain of being separated from his son and said in a trembling voice, ‘Son, change your thoughts of giving and stay.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Even if the earth together with the mountains</p>
<p>Turned back,</p>
<p>O master of the earth, I would not turn my mind</p>
<p>Back from giving.’</p>
<p>“Then, riding a chariot with his son, daughter, and wife, he departed the most excellent city. A hundred thousand saddened citizens and provincial dwellers followed him. Then a man heard their crying, lamenting voices and saw the many people going out the city gate, and he asked another man, ‘My good man, many people are lamenting. What has caused this?’</p>
<p>“He answered, ‘Sir, how do you not know?</p>
<p>“ ‘The master of the people has banished his own son, who has beautiful teeth,</p>
<p>Who is of a steadfast nature, who is pleased with giving.</p>
<p>He is setting forth for the forest together with his children and wife,</p>
<p>And citizens have gathered and are lamenting with deep pity.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the bodhisattva approached in an appropriate manner the citizens who had left the most excellent city and said, ‘Sirs, go home, go home. Even if you stay with loved ones for a very long time, you will certainly end up parting from them. Your relatives’ company is just like a tree under which you break the fatigue from traveling. So you will certainly part from loved ones. Why?</p>
<p>“ ‘Thinking that everywhere in the world</p>
<p>People are powerless to prevent parting from friends,</p>
<p>You should with every exertion on the face of the earth</p>
<p>Make your resolve immovable and steadfast for the sake of tranquility.’</p>
<p>“Then, a brahmin who had traveled for three hundred yojanas saw the bodhisattva and approached him. He said, ‘O kṣatriya prince, having heard of your good qualities, I have come here from a country three hundred yojanas away. It is therefore appropriate that you give me this most excellent chariot as a reward for my efforts.’</p>
<p>“Unable to bear it, Mādrī shouted at the brahmin with harsh words:</p>
<p>“ ‘Shame! Even in the forest he dares beg from the son of the people’s master.</p>
<p>This brahmin has an utterly pitiless mind.</p>
<p>The son of the people’s master has lost his royal wealth.</p>
<p>Does this man have no compassion for him?’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva said, ‘You should not scold the brahmin. Why?</p>
<p>“ ‘Mādrī, if those who desire and accept wealth did not exist,</p>
<p>Who could attain awakening in this world, bereft of the opportunity to give thoroughly?</p>
<p>By means of the six perfections beginning with giving, bodhisattvas</p>
<p>Who are possessed of the best qualities always attain supreme omniscience.’</p>
<p>“And so, greatly pleased, the bodhisattva gave the chariot, along with its horses, to the brahmin and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O brahmin, by this removal of the impurity of greed,</p>
<p>This giving away the chariot, in this world</p>
<p>I will advance the chariot of the great untainted Dharma</p>
<p>That has been advanced by the greatest ṛṣis.’</p>
<p>“And so, with his mind greatly pleased, Viśvantara gave that most excellent chariot to the brahmin and went to the forest of ascetics, carrying their son Kṛṣṇa on his shoulder, with Mādrī holding their daughter Jālinī in her arms. They arrived in due course at the forest of ascetics. Thereupon Viśvantara lived in the forest of ascetics, keeping vows that pleased his heart.</p>
<p>“Later, when Mādrī had gone from the forest of ascetics to collect roots and fruits, a certain brahmin came to Viśvantara and said, ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!</p>
<p>“ ‘We, husband and wife, are wandering together</p>
<p>Because we do not have any servants.</p>
<p>It would therefore be appropriate that you</p>
<p>Give us your two children.’</p>
<p>“Having been told this, the bodhisattva Viśvantara pondered for a while about giving away his beloved children. Then the brahmin said to the bodhisattva Viśvantara, ‘O kṣatriya prince, I am asking you this because I have heard that you give away everything. What do you have to consider about this?</p>
<p>“ ‘As a giver who is naturally compassionate,</p>
<p>You are renowned throughout the world.</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you to act</p>
<p>Always in the way you are renowned.’</p>
<p>“Having been spoken to like this, the bodhisattva Viśvantara said to the brahmin, ‘O great brahmin,</p>
<p>“ ‘I would not mind for one moment</p>
<p>Giving even my own life,</p>
<p>So, why would I change my mind</p>
<p>About giving away my children?</p>
<p>“ ‘Great brahmin, however,</p>
<p>“ ‘I wonder, after I abandon these two children</p>
<p>Who have grown up in the forest,</p>
<p>How they will live</p>
<p>With the sorrow of separation from their mother.</p>
<p>“ ‘Someone will scold me:</p>
<p>“The prince is so pitiless</p>
<p>That he gives away his children, but not himself.”</p>
<p>O brahmin, please instruct me.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin said to Viśvantara, ‘O kṣatriya prince, it is not appropriate for you, who were born to a lineage of great kings; whose good qualities are renowned all over this world; who loves all beings with compassion; who is unstoppable just like a rutting elephant in practicing generosity, veneration, and honor; who venerates śramaṇas, brahmins, and guests; who accepts those who are poor, destitute, helpless, and hungry; who fulfills everyone’s wishes; and who is beneficial to see, to make my coming in vain, my effort of traveling unfruitful, my seeing you not beneficial, and my wish and desire for which I have been struggling for a long time unfruitful. If my chariot of mind (manoratha, “wish”), whose horses are thoughts, is struck by your words of refusal, it will quickly return. Therefore, it is appropriate for you to satisfy my wish and give them. Why?</p>
<p>“ ‘Even if one were to search the entire earth with its cities and villages,</p>
<p>Which wears oceans as garments, whose incomparable eyes are planets,</p>
<p>Whose torso has great, excellent mountains as breasts,</p>
<p>There would be no one as generous as you, O you who have beautiful teeth.’</p>
<p>“When he had heard these words of the brahmin, the bodhisattva Viśvantara was overcome by attachment to his children and worried:</p>
<p>“ ‘First, if I give</p>
<p>The two children to the brahmin,</p>
<p>I and Mādrī will suffer the pain</p>
<p>Of separation from them.</p>
<p>“ ‘However, if I do not give them to him,</p>
<p>My vow will be ruined,</p>
<p>And this brahmin will leave</p>
<p>Disappointed, without gaining anything.</p>
<p>“ ‘Second, depressed by separation from my children,</p>
<p>I will feel sorrow on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the promise I made,</p>
<p>My vow, will be ruined.’</p>
<p>“Then the bodhisattva Viśvantara decided definitely to give his two beloved children away and declared:</p>
<p>“ ‘I will build a bridge with a hundred difficult acts</p>
<p>To lead the world, which has sunk</p>
<p>Into the immeasurable depths of the great ocean of suffering,</p>
<p>To the further shore.’</p>
<p>“Having spoken such words without hesitation,</p>
<p>He whose face was like the spotless full moon</p>
<p>Gave the two young children,</p>
<p>Whose eyes were filled with tears, to the brahmin.</p>
<p>“He said further:</p>
<p>“ ‘After I have attained the great fruit</p>
<p>Of this giving of the children,</p>
<p>Thereby beings in the world</p>
<p>Should be able to cross the ocean of saṃsāra.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he gave the young children, the earth quaked in six ways. The ascetics living in the forest were surprised at the quaking of the earth and asked each other:</p>
<p>“ ‘By whose power</p>
<p>Did this dreadful quaking of the earth occur?</p>
<p>We must clearly come to know</p>
<p>What has such power.’</p>
<p>“There was an old ascetic there from the Vasiṣṭha family who was learned in omens. He informed the ṛṣis about this matter: ‘Certainly, Viśvantara has relinquished his two children who lived in the forest of ascetics, the little ones who ate fruits and drank water, who were pleasant and agreeable to the eyes, in order to save beings overwhelmed by suffering. For this reason, the earth quaked.’</p>
<p>“Then the two children knew that their father intended from his heart to give them away, and, crying piteously, they made the gesture of supplication, threw themselves at Viśvantara’s feet,  and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Father, you are giving us away</p>
<p>While mother is absent.</p>
<p>Please, let us see her first;</p>
<p>Then you may give us away.’</p>
<p>“Contorting his face with the pain that seized his heart and shedding tears, the bodhisattva embraced the two children and said, ‘Children,</p>
<p>“ ‘It is not that you are not loved in my heart</p>
<p>Or that I have no compassion or mercy.</p>
<p>I give you to benefit the whole world,</p>
<p>Having seen the good qualities of this act.</p>
<p>“ ‘By all means, after I myself attain</p>
<p>Peaceful supreme awakening,</p>
<p>I will liberate the shelterless beings in the world</p>
<p>Who dwell in the ocean of suffering.’</p>
<p>“Then, knowing that their father intended from his heart to give them away, the children paid homage at their father’s feet, made the gesture of supplication, and slowly said in piteous voices with humble words:</p>
<p>“ ‘If you have decided,</p>
<p>Father, may you give a message</p>
<p>From the two of us to our mother:</p>
<p>“May you bear it.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Again, Father,</p>
<p>“ ‘For the faults we have committed out of childishness against you who are respectable,</p>
<p>The unpleasant words we have spoken to anyone, if any,</p>
<p>And that we did not listen to you respectfully or please you—</p>
<p>Please forgive us, taking them as childish faults.’</p>
<p>“After they had thus spoken, they saluted their father, circumambulated him three times, and left the hermitage with tearful eyes, still desiring to speak to the respectable one, looking back again and again.</p>
<p>“Then, losing his composure because of his young children’s very piteous words, the bodhisattva made a vow for awakening in his mind and entered the hut in the forest of ascetics. As soon as the young children left, the worlds of the great billionfold universe quaked in six ways. Thousands of gods  emitted cries and laughter in the air, and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Bravo! Great nature of generosity!</p>
<p>Excellent is the steadfastness of the one</p>
<p>Who does not change his mind,</p>
<p>Even having given his two children.’</p>
<p>“At that time Mādrī was coming back to the hermitage, bringing roots and fruits. She hurried to the hermitage because of the quaking of the earth. A deity thought, ‘Mādrī is coming to deter the bodhisattva from the perfection of giving in which he has made efforts to liberate all beings,’ and so the deity assumed the form of a lioness and stood blocking the way. Mādrī said to the wife of the king of beasts:</p>
<p>“ ‘Attractive wife of the king of beasts,</p>
<p>Why are you blocking the way?</p>
<p>As I am of unshaken constancy,</p>
<p>Get out of the way and go quickly!</p>
<p>“ ‘Again,</p>
<p>“ ‘You are the wife of the king of beasts;</p>
<p>I too am the consort of the people’s master,</p>
<p>Who is like a lion. Hence, you are my sister, according to the Dharma.</p>
<p>So, queen of beasts, make way for me.’</p>
<p>“Having been spoken to in this way, the deity assuming the form of a lioness left the road in a certain direction. Thereupon, seeing inauspicious signs, Mādrī paused to think: ‘As I hear voices sobbing in the air, and the lamenting voices of the gods living in the forest, too, something unfortunate has certainly happened in the hermitage.’ She then said aloud:</p>
<p>“ ‘As my eyes are blinking,</p>
<p>As birds are crying,</p>
<p>As I feel anxious,</p>
<p>The two children must have been given away.</p>
<p>“ ‘As the land quakes,</p>
<p>And my heart quivers,</p>
<p>And as my body feels ill,</p>
<p>The two children must have been given away.’</p>
<p>“Thinking of a hundred thousand such unfortunate things, she hurried to the hermitage.  When she entered the hermitage, upset, she searched for the two children but did not see them. Perplexed, with her mind quivering, she thought at each place in the hermitage, ‘In this place, my son Kṛṣṇa with his sister always played with fawns. These are the houses the two of them made from dust. These are the toys of those two. But I do not see them. Perhaps they have entered a grass hut that I do not see and are sleeping.’ Thus worrying and desiring to see her children, she put the roots and fruits to one side, threw herself at her husband’s feet, and cried out with tearful eyes, ‘My dear, where are the two, our son and daughter?’</p>
<p>“Viśvantara said to her:</p>
<p>“ ‘A brahmin with a wish</p>
<p>Came to me,</p>
<p>And I gave those two children to him.</p>
<p>It would be appropriate for you to be pleased with this.’</p>
<p>“When she was told this, Mādrī fell to the ground like a doe shot with a poisoned arrow, writhed like a fish out of water, cried in a piteous voice like a crane that had lost its chicks, lowed in various ways like a cow whose calves have died, and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘With faces like young lotus blossoms,</p>
<p>With hands as fresh as lotus petals,</p>
<p>My two children had never experienced any pain.</p>
<p>In which direction do they go, just to suffer?</p>
<p>“ ‘Being as meek as fawns, with eyes like a fawn’s,</p>
<p>Having enjoyed the hermitage together with fawns—</p>
<p>How did my two children suffer today,</p>
<p>Dragged away by another?</p>
<p>“ ‘With their eyes full of tears,</p>
<p>Crying in sorrow, greatly suffering,</p>
<p>They will live miserably among poor people</p>
<p>Because I was not carefully watching them today.</p>
<p>“ ‘Those two I raised on my lap</p>
<p>Ate roots, flowers, and fruits as meals.</p>
<p>My two children, who lived with patience and loved those who are respectable,</p>
<p>Are suffering greatly.</p>
<p>“ ‘The two have been parted from their mother and kinsmen,</p>
<p>And have been suddenly abandoned by their relatives.</p>
<p>Having met an evil, sinful person,</p>
<p>My two children are suffering greatly.</p>
<p>“ ‘Pressed by constant hunger and thirst,</p>
<p>By whom were the two taken away?</p>
<p>Having become slaves, certainly</p>
<p>The two will suffer from dreadful pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘Surely, I must have in other lives</p>
<p>Committed a dreadful, evil act in this world</p>
<p>And parted beings from a hundred loved ones</p>
<p>Whereby I am now crushed by grief like a cow without its calves.</p>
<p>“ ‘The true words by which I have always conceived</p>
<p>Impartial thoughts for every living being—</p>
<p>By these true words</p>
<p>May my two children be liberated from servitude.’</p>
<p>“Mādrī saw trees that those young children had planted and grown, which had abundant leaves, and in her anguish embraced them, and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘The trees on which the children poured water with a little water jar,</p>
<p>From whose leaves water is dripping,</p>
<p>Look as if they have hearts,</p>
<p>Like a mother giving milk to her children.’</p>
<p>“Then she saw the fawns that had played with the two young children sitting in the hermitage and became pained. She slowly said in a piteous voice:</p>
<p>“ ‘These fawns who are their friends,</p>
<p>Who want to see them</p>
<p>And walk around looking for them in the house,</p>
<p>Are another source of extreme pain for me.’</p>
<p>“Then, when she followed the way along which those children had gone, she saw that the two young children’s footprints were not straight but twisted and turned here and there. Pressed by acute pain again, she said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Since there remain footsteps of shuffled feet,</p>
<p>And they proceed in a hurry here and there,</p>
<p>Certainly, he must have hit them while he took them along.</p>
<p>Shame! So pitiless a brahmin!</p>
<p>“ ‘With their throats gasping, giving out cries,</p>
<p>With their lovely lips quivering,</p>
<p>With watery eyes like a deer and tender feet,</p>
<p>How did my children go?’</p>
<p>“Upon seeing her thus pouring out lamentations, the bodhisattva reasoned with her with words concerning impermanence in a variety of ways and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘I did not give the two children for the sake of fame</p>
<p>Nor out of hatred.</p>
<p>For the benefit of all beings,</p>
<p>I gave the children who were difficult to give.</p>
<p>“ ‘Having given himself, his own children, and his wife,</p>
<p>Who are the most difficult to give,</p>
<p>The mahāsattva will properly attain</p>
<p>Supreme awakening.</p>
<p>“ ‘Mādrī, relying upon giving, I gave those two children</p>
<p>Who were difficult to give in order to liberate the world.</p>
<p>I have a resolve to give myself and my wife, vehicle, and wealth,</p>
<p>And give everything to everyone.’</p>
<p>“Then Mādrī said to the bodhisattva, making a firm resolution:</p>
<p>“ ‘I will not thwart you.</p>
<p>May your mind never become otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are asked to give me, too,</p>
<p>Give me without hesitation.</p>
<p>“ ‘Again,</p>
<p>“ ‘O hero, having soon accomplished the purpose</p>
<p>For which you gave your family,</p>
<p>Who are attached to their beloved,</p>
<p>Liberate beings from existence.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, knew that the bodhisattva and Mādrī were making efforts that were marvelous and very difficult to make. Surrounded by the Thirty-Three Gods, he approached the hermitage through the sky, illuminated the forest with a vast splendor of light, and said to the bodhisattva while hovering in the air:</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus among foolish beings in the world, of weak intelligence and intellects shackled by propensities,</p>
<p>Who are attached to enjoyment and fettered by children who are a noose for the mind,</p>
<p>O Ruler, only you will attain the firm, happy, tranquil, spotless, and faultless state</p>
<p>By giving away your children who cause you joy, being free from attachment.’</p>
<p>“Having encouraged the bodhisattva in this way, Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, ‘If he winds up alone, separated from the one attending him, he will become distressed. So I will now ask him for Mādrī.’</p>
<p>“Then he assumed the form of a brahmin, went to the bodhisattva, and said to him:</p>
<p>“ ‘Give me this sister, of perfect body,</p>
<p>A devoted wife who never becomes</p>
<p>Unfaithful to her husband,</p>
<p>And is praised for her family lineage, as a slave.’</p>
<p>“Unable to bear this, Mādrī said to the brahmin:</p>
<p>“ ‘Do you, who are shameless and greedy,</p>
<p>The worst brahmin in this world,</p>
<p>Desire me, a faithful wife</p>
<p>Who rejoices in the authentic Dharma?’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva Viśvantara observed Mādrī with a compassionate mind. Mādrī then said to the bodhisattva:</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not lament for myself.</p>
<p>I do not care about myself,</p>
<p>But I lament for you, wondering</p>
<p>How you will live alone.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva replied to Mādrī:</p>
<p>“ ‘On the face of the earth, Mādrī, you should not grieve for me,</p>
<p>Who seeks the state free from decay and grief.</p>
<p>You should follow this brahmin without grieving.</p>
<p>I will limp into the hermitage like a dying animal.’</p>
<p>“After saying this, being pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he thought:</p>
<p>“ ‘This gift is, in this forest,</p>
<p>My last donation.</p>
<p>After having given this Mādrī,</p>
<p>There will be nothing that fetters me.’</p>
<p>“Knowing this, he held Mādrī with his hand and said to the brahmin:</p>
<p>“ ‘O best of brahmins,</p>
<p>Please accept my beloved wife,</p>
<p>Who is heartily pleased to obey,</p>
<p>Who is noble and acts properly, and who speaks agreeably.’</p>
<p>“Then he gave his wife, who had beautiful teeth,</p>
<p>In order to seek awakening.</p>
<p>As if it were a ship on the water,</p>
<p>The entire earth quaked in six ways.</p>
<p>“Thereupon Mādrī entered into the brahmin’s possession. Overwhelmed by the pain of separation from her husband, son, and daughter, she said, her voice interrupted by gasping:</p>
<p>“ ‘What evil karma did I create</p>
<p>In my previous lives,</p>
<p>Whereby I weep in a solitary forest</p>
<p>Like a cow whose calves have died?’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, extinguished his form as a brahmin, took his own form, and said to Mādrī:</p>
<p>“ ‘Fortunate one, I am not a brahmin or human;</p>
<p>I am Śakra, Lord of the Gods, destroyer of the asuras.</p>
<p>This eminent conduct of yours pleased me.</p>
<p>So, ask for anything you most want from me here.’</p>
<p>Having rejoiced at these words, Mādrī bowed to Śakra and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Thousand-Eyed,</p>
<p>May the king of the Thirty-Three Gods</p>
<p>Liberate my children from servitude</p>
<p>And let them reach their grandfather.’</p>
<p>“Having had this asked of him, the great Indra entered the hermitage, held Mādrī with his left hand, went to the bodhisattva, and said to him:</p>
<p>“ ‘I give you back this Mādrī</p>
<p>To attend to you.</p>
<p>You should not give her to anyone.</p>
<p>You will be scolded if you give away one entrusted to you.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, drove that brahmin who had taken away the son and daughter insane so that he went to that very city, thinking that it was some other city, and offered to sell the young children. The ministers saw this and said to the king, ‘Your Majesty,</p>
<p>“ ‘Your two grandchildren,</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa and Jālinī,</p>
<p>Are being sold by a wicked brahmin</p>
<p>In this most excellent city.’</p>
<p>“When he heard this, the king became upset and said, ‘Quickly, show me the two children.’</p>
<p>“The ministers gave a cry, and the citizens hurried to the king. Then a minister took the children to the king.</p>
<p>“When he saw his grandchildren brought before him without any clothes,</p>
<p>Their bodies covered with dirt, the master of the people</p>
<p>Suddenly fell to the ground from the throne,</p>
<p>And citizens, ministers, and women wept, too.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the king said to the ministers:</p>
<p>“ ‘Somebody, call him here,</p>
<p>Whose mind is pleased with giving even while living in the forest</p>
<p>And whose eyes are beautiful,</p>
<p>Together with his wife, quickly!’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, bowed to the bodhisattva and departed for his residence. Sometime after, King Viśvāmitra died. Brahmins, ministers, citizens, and provincial dwellers went to the hermitage together, requested the bodhisattva to return to his own city, and enthroned him. Thereafter Viśvantara as a king was called Sarvaṃdada, ‘Giver of Everything.’ After having given various donations to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, the destitute, friends, kinsmen, relatives, and laborers, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘One who seeks awakening and merit</p>
<p>Gives donations without fear</p>
<p>To kṣatriyas, brahmins, vaiśyas,</p>
<p>Śūdras, caṇḍālas, and pukkasas.</p>
<p>“ ‘He gives gold, silver, oxen,</p>
<p>Horses, various jeweled ornaments,</p>
<p>And slaves to do various tasks</p>
<p>To those of completely good conduct.</p>
<p>“ ‘By giving his son and daughter</p>
<p>With a mind free from attachment,</p>
<p>A man will attain purity</p>
<p>In this world and the next.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was King Viśvantara, who gave various donations to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, the destitute, friends, kinsmen, relatives, and laborers, and thereby made merit, at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was that king named Viśvantara at that time, on that occasion, and there I gave various donations to śramaṇas, brahmins, the poor, the destitute, friends, kinsmen, relatives, and laborers, and thereby made merit.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations of mine, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>b. Viśvantara’s Story II</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a king named Viśvāmitra in a city called Viśvapurī.  Just as he loved his only son, he ruled in accordance with the Dharma over his country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people, where there was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, robbers, or illness, and which was abundant in rice, sugarcane, and cattle.</p>
<p>“He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a son was born who was well proportioned, attractive, pleasant to behold, gold in complexion,  with a head like a parasol, long arms, and a broad forehead. His kinsmen met together and said, ‘What name shall we give the boy?’ Then they said, ‘Sirs, since this prince is the son of King Viśvāmitra, let us name him Prince Viśvantara.’ And so they named the prince Viśvantara.  He was entrusted to eight nurses . . . .  He became fully learned in the five arts . . . .</p>
<p>“Since he gave everything that was begged for to those who begged, he was known as Sarvaṃdada, ‘Giver of Everything.’</p>
<p>“There was a daughter of a neighboring minor king called Mādrī. She was asked for and taken to him as a bride together with a vast amount of treasure. He and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Later, a son was born, and he was named Kṛṣṇa. Again they played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a daughter was born, and she was named Jālinī.</p>
<p>“King Viśvāmitra had a most excellent elephant, called Auspicious, and neighboring minor kings were jealous of him for its power. He said to Viśvantara, ‘Son, it is all because of this most excellent elephant that the neighboring minor kings envy us. Even if you give everything else, keep the most excellent elephant Auspicious.’</p>
<p>“The neighboring minor kings asked each other, ‘Through whose power are we all defeated by this King Viśvāmitra?’</p>
<p>“One of them said, ‘King Viśvāmitra has the best elephant, called Auspicious. Through its power we are all defeated by him.’</p>
<p>“The rest wondered,  ‘Is there any good means whereby we could acquire this most excellent elephant?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesties,’ said the ministers, ‘the son of King Viśvāmitra, named Viśvantara, gives and bestows everything, without exception. Because he gives everything that is begged for, he is known as Sarvaṃdada. So, if you send some brahmins and they beg him, you will obtain the elephant.’</p>
<p>“They summoned some brahmins and ordered them, ‘O brahmins, go and beg someone called Viśvantara for the most excellent elephant in Viśvapurī.’</p>
<p>“They were then dispatched and proceeded to Viśvapurī.</p>
<p>“Prince Viśvantara mounted the most excellent elephant, whose color was white like the flowers of jasmine and white water lily, snow, silver, and white clouds, who was possessed of six kinds of greatness, whose body was well supported in its seven parts, whose feet were well supported, and who walked majestically like the elephant Airāvaṇa, was adorned with the best characteristics, and was auspicious to behold. He left the city and went to a park, followed by his favorite slaves, friends, and servants like the moon surrounded by stars.</p>
<p>“Those messengers went to see Prince Viśvantara and first greeted him: ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!’ Then they said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Throughout the world, including among the asuras and gods,</p>
<p>You are renowned as Sarvaṃdada, “Giver of Everything.”</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you</p>
<p>To give this most excellent elephant to us.’</p>
<p>“Having been spoken to this way, the bodhisattva dismounted from the most excellent elephant. With his mind pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he showed the most excellent elephant to the brahmins and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I give this most excellent elephant to brahmins</p>
<p>With great pleasure today,</p>
<p>May I give everything in the three realms of existence</p>
<p>And attain supreme awakening.’</p>
<p>“ ‘The ministers  reported to King Viśvāmitra, ‘Your Majesty, your son Viśvantara gave the most excellent elephant named Auspicious to those sent by our enemies.’</p>
<p>“When he was told this, the king trembled with intense anger and ordered them, ‘Sirs, bring Viśvantara today.’</p>
<p>“They brought him, and King Viśvāmitra said to Viśvantara, ‘Son, did I not once instruct you, “The only thing the neighboring minor kings are jealous of us for is this most excellent elephant’s power. So, even if you give away everything else, keep this most excellent elephant”? Why did you give away the most excellent elephant?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Father,’ he replied, ‘how could I refuse when I was begged?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why do you give everything begged for?’</p>
<p>“He answered with a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘A man dwelling at home</p>
<p>Gives donations in a proper manner.</p>
<p>But if he goes to the forest,</p>
<p>He should perform the best self-restraint.</p>
<p>“ ‘Father, if I cannot give donations or make merit, I will dwell in the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son, you should do so.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva went to Mādrī and said, ‘Mādrī, I am going to live in the forest of ascetics; you should live carefully at home.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will live with my master in the forest of ascetics too,’ she replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘Mādrī, since bodhisattvas are pleased with giving, if someone begs for you, I will give you away.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, if you have to give me away, please do so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Remember what you promised,’ cautioned the bodhisattva.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the bodhisattva went to his father, bowed to him, and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Father, master of the earth, please forgive me for my fault,</p>
<p>Which was my giving that most excellent elephant as a donation.</p>
<p>I will leave the city and go to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Your storehouse, O master of the people, will not become empty.’</p>
<p>“Then the king, distracted by the separation from his son and choking with tears, said, ‘Son, withdraw your determination to give donations and go to the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Even if the earth together with the mountains</p>
<p>Turned back,</p>
<p>O master of the earth, I would not turn my mind</p>
<p>Back from generosity.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva then departed, mounting the most excellent chariot with his son, daughter, and wife, and went to the forest of ascetics.</p>
<p>“Then certain brahmins who had mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas met Viśvantara and said, ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!</p>
<p>“ ‘All over the world, you are</p>
<p>Renowned as Sarvaṃdada, “Giver of Everything.”</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you</p>
<p>To give this chariot to brahmins as a donation.’</p>
<p>“Having been thus requested, the bodhisattva dismounted from that most excellent chariot. With his heart pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he showed the most excellent chariot to the brahmins and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I give this chariot to brahmins</p>
<p>With great pleasure today,</p>
<p>May I give away all the three realms of existence</p>
<p>And attain supreme awakening.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the bodhisattva mounted a horse and proceeded with Mādrī. Then certain brahmins who had mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas met Viśvantara and said, ‘O kṣatriya prince, victory to you!</p>
<p>“ ‘All over the world, you are</p>
<p>Renowned as Sarvaṃdada, ‘Giver of Everything.’</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you</p>
<p>To give this horse to brahmins as a donation.’</p>
<p>“Having this said to him, the bodhisattva dismounted from the horse. With his heart pleased, delighted, and gladdened, he showed the horse to these brahmins and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Just as I give the horse to brahmins</p>
<p>With great pleasure today,</p>
<p>May I give away all the three realms of existence</p>
<p>And attain supreme awakening.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the bodhisattva went on foot, leading Kṛṣṇa, with Mādrī leading Jālinī. The bodhisattva went to a valley on Mount Kailāsa that was abundant in flowers, fruits, and water. The bodhisattva practiced dhyāna. Mādrī served him with fruits.</p>
<p>“There lived a brahmin in a certain hamlet. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and his wife played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a son who had eighteen inauspicious marks was born. He uttered the cry ‘Jujjuka!’ whereupon he was named Jujjuka. There lived in another hamlet a brahmin who knew the four Vedas. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and his wife played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a daughter was born, who was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. When she had been raised and had grown up, the brahmin made a vow: ‘I will not give this daughter of mine to anyone for his looks, family, work, or wealth. But if someone learns the four Vedas from me, I shall give her to him.’</p>
<p>“Then Jujjuka went to the brahmin, seeking mantras, looking for mantras. Upon his arrival, he said, ‘I make a request of you, paying homage at the master’s feet.’</p>
<p>“ ‘For the sake of what?’</p>
<p>“ ‘In order to learn the Vedas.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You should do so.’</p>
<p>“He began to learn the Vedas from him. Possessed of a brilliant nature, he soon mastered the four Vedas. The brahmin thought, ‘I have made a vow: “I will not give this daughter of mine to anyone for his family . . . .” This young brahmin  has mastered the four Vedas from me, but he has eighteen inauspicious marks. It would be good if he did not want my daughter.’ He said to Jujjuka, ‘Young brahmin, I have made a vow: “I will not give my daughter to anyone for his looks, family, work, or wealth. But if someone learns the four Vedas from me, I will give her to him.” Since you have mastered the four Vedas from me, I will give you this daughter as your wife.’</p>
<p>“ ‘May all be well with you!’ he replied. ‘I will accept her.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin gave her to him as a bride together with a vast amount of treasure and said, ‘Young brahmin, return to your home, taking your wife with you.’</p>
<p>“Taking his wife with him, he went to his home. She said to him, ‘My dear, I am so delicate that I cannot do housework. Please give me a servant.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O good lady,’ he asked her, ‘where would I find a servant?’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear,’ she replied, ‘there is a king called Viśvāmitra in Viśvapurī. His son, called Viśvantara, gives everything that is begged for. Beg him for a servant for me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O good lady, if that is the case, let us go together.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Jujjuka went to Viśvapurī and asked, ‘Where is Prince Viśvantara?’</p>
<p>“ ‘He lives in the forest of ascetics,’  they answered.</p>
<p>“Then Jujjuka went to the forest of ascetics with his wife. At that time Mādrī went to collect flowers and fruits. Then the brahmin Jujjuka, after Mādrī had gone to collect flowers and fruits, approached Viśvantara and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Even if one were to search the entire earth with its cities and villages,</p>
<p>Which wears oceans as garments, whose incomparable eyes are planets,</p>
<p>Whose torso has great, excellent mountains as breasts.</p>
<p>There would be no one as generous as you, O you who have beautiful teeth.</p>
<p>“ ‘We, husband and wife, are wandering together</p>
<p>Because we do not have any servants.</p>
<p>It is therefore appropriate for you</p>
<p>To have compassion for us and give us servants.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why would I have any servants?’ asked the prince.</p>
<p>“Near them, Kṛṣṇa and Jālinī were playing. Jujjuka said, ‘Give us these young children.’</p>
<p>“Having this asked of him, the bodhisattva pondered for a while about giving away his beloved children. Then the brahmin said to Viśvantara, ‘O kṣatriya prince, since I have heard that you give everything, I am begging you. What do you have to consider about this?</p>
<p>“ ‘Being naturally compassionate, you are renowned</p>
<p>Throughout the world as Sarvaṃdada, “Giver of Everything.”</p>
<p>It is appropriate for you to act</p>
<p>In the world in the way you are known for.’</p>
<p>“Having been spoken to like this, the bodhisattva said to the brahmin:</p>
<p>“ ‘I would not waver for one moment</p>
<p>Even when giving away my own life;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I would not change my mind</p>
<p>About giving away my children.</p>
<p>“ ‘Great brahmin, however,</p>
<p>“ ‘I wonder, if I abandon these two children</p>
<p>Who have grown up in the forest,</p>
<p>How they will live</p>
<p>With the sorrow of separation from their mother.</p>
<p>“ ‘Someone will scold me:</p>
<p>“The prince is so pitiless</p>
<p>That he gives away his children, but not himself.”</p>
<p>O brahmin, please instruct me.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin said to the bodhisattva, ‘O kṣatriya prince, it is not appropriate for you, who were born to a lineage of great kings; whose good qualities are renowned all over this world; who loves all beings with compassion; who is just like a rutting elephant in your donations, veneration, and paying honor; who venerates śramaṇas, brahmins, guests, and respectable people; who accepts those who are poor, helpless,  and destitute; who fulfills everyone’s wishes; and who is beneficial to see, to make my coming in vain, my effort of traveling unfruitful, my seeing you not beneficial, my wish and desire for which I have been struggling for a long time unfruitful. If my chariot of mind (manoratha, “wish”), whose horses are thoughts, is struck by your words of refusal, it will quickly return. Therefore, it is appropriate for you to satisfy my wish and give them.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O brahmin,’ said the bodhisattva, ‘if so, I will give them.’</p>
<p>“As soon as he gave the young children, the worlds of the great billionfold universe quaked in six ways. Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, ‘Mādrī is coming to deter the bodhisattva from giving donations.’ He assumed the form of a lioness and stood blocking the way. Then Mādrī said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Attractive wife of the king of beasts,</p>
<p>Why are you blocking the way?</p>
<p>If it is true that I am unshaken,</p>
<p>Get out of the way and go quickly!</p>
<p>“ ‘You are the wife of the king of beasts;</p>
<p>I too am the consort of the people’s master,</p>
<p>Who is like a lion. Hence, you are my sister, according to the Dharma.</p>
<p>So, wife of the king of beasts, make way for me.’</p>
<p>“Having been told this, the queen of beasts left the road in a certain direction. Thereupon Mādrī went to the hermitage. She did not see Kṛṣṇa and Jālinī anywhere. She went to the bodhisattva and asked, ‘My dear, where are the young children?’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘A brahmin with a wish</p>
<p>Came to me,</p>
<p>And I gave those two children to him.</p>
<p>It is appropriate for you to be pleased with this.’</p>
<p>“She fainted and fell to the ground. After he poured much water on her, she came to  and said, ‘My dear, the young children grew up in the forest of ascetics and had a happy nature. Why did you abandon them?’</p>
<p>“Then the bodhisattva stripped the upper garment off his body and said to Mādrī, ‘Why do you think that I have no love for the two of them? Look at all my pores, which are rent and shedding blood.’</p>
<p>“Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, ‘Since the bodhisattvas of the fortunate eon are pleased with giving, if someone asks for Mādrī and the bodhisattva gives her to him, there will be no one to attend him.’ He assumed the form of a young brahmin, stood in front of the bodhisattva, and said, ‘Friend, give me an attendant.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Where would I have an attendant?’ asked the bodhisattva.</p>
<p>“ ‘Give me Mādrī,’ Śakra replied.</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva then observed Mādrī’s face. Mādrī knew the bodhisattva’s thoughts and said, ‘My dear, if you are going to give me away, please do so.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattva said, ‘Brahmin, I will give her to you.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, dissolved his form as a young brahmin, assumed his own form, and said, ‘O ṛṣi, I entrust you with this Mādrī. You should never give her to anyone.’</p>
<p>“Mādrī bowed low until her forehead touched Śakra’s feet and requested him, ‘O Kauśika, please ensure by any means that our two young children do not fall into servitude.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do so,’ Śakra, Lord of the Gods, assured her, and he then disappeared. Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, drove that brahmin who had taken away the young children insane so that he tried to sell them in Viśvapurī. The king’s men saw the two of them and then went to the king and said, ‘The children Kṛṣṇa and Jālinī are being sold by a brahmin at the market.’</p>
<p>“He ordered them, ‘Sirs, go and bring them.’ The two were brought, and the king weighed them and redeemed them for their weight in gold. The king said to his ministers, ‘Sirs, is there anything else he who has even given away his son and daughter could not give away? Summon the prince. I will enthrone him.’</p>
<p>“The ministers summoned him from the forest of ascetics. After he was enthroned, he built offering halls at the four city gates, gave donations, and made merit for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. Having seen the perfection of his offerings, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘One who seeks awakening and merit</p>
<p>Gives donations without fear</p>
<p>To śramaṇas, brahmins,</p>
<p>Śūdras, caṇḍālas, and pukkasas.</p>
<p>“ ‘He gives gold, silver, oxen,</p>
<p>Horses, various jeweled ornaments,</p>
<p>And slaves to do various tasks</p>
<p>To those who have good conduct.</p>
<p>“ ‘By giving his son and daughter</p>
<p>With a mind free from attachment,</p>
<p>One will attain purity</p>
<p>In this world and the next.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was the king named Viśvantara, who gave away his children and wife, at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was that king named Viśvantara at that time, on that occasion, and I gave away my children and wife.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by my giving away my children and wife, you should think otherwise; this donation was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>11. Saṃdhāna</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave donations and made merit.  Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“ Great King, once in a city called Vārāṇasī a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country, which was rich, prosperous, . . . in accordance with the Dharma.</p>
<p>“One day astrologers predicted that it would not rain for twelve years in Vārāṇasī. King Brahmadatta then announced with the ringing of bells in his country: ‘Listen, people living in my country! Astrologers have predicted that it will not rain for twelve years. Whoever among you has food and drink to last twelve years should stay. Others should go to countries where there is food and drink, and come back when there is again an abundant harvest.’</p>
<p>“At that time, there was a householder named Saṃdhāna living in the city of Vārāṇasī, who was very rich and had great wealth and many possessions, with holdings both vast and extensive. He possessed wealth like that of Vaiśravaṇa, rivaling that of Vaiśravaṇa. He called the storehouse keeper and asked, ‘My good man, is there enough food for me and my attendants to survive for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, there is, Master,’ answered the storehouse keeper.</p>
<p>“Thus, the householder Saṃdhāna stayed with his attendants. Other people went to countries where there was food and drink.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear, there appear self-awakened ones as the only fields of merit in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with places to sit on the outskirts of towns. At that time there lived five hundred self-awakened ones in one place in Vārāṇasī. In another place, there were five hundred self-awakened ones, too. Then early one morning, the first five hundred self-awakened ones dressed, took their bowls and their robes, and went to the householder Saṃdhāna. When they arrived, they asked the householder Saṃdhāna, ‘Householder,  can you give almsfood to five hundred mendicants for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Noble ones,’ he replied, ‘I will now ask the storehouse keeper.’</p>
<p>“He called the storehouse keeper and asked him, ‘My good man, is there enough food for me, my attendants, and these five hundred mendicants to survive for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, there is, Master,’ answered the storehouse keeper.</p>
<p>“He then made a promise to feed the five hundred self-awakened ones.</p>
<p>“Later, in the afternoon, the other five hundred self-awakened ones came and asked the householder Saṃdhāna, ‘Householder, can you give almsfood to five hundred mendicants for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Noble ones,’ he replied, ‘I have already promised it to you. Are you asking for it again?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Householder, they are one group, and we are another,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘Noble ones, if that is so,’ he said, ‘I will now ask the storehouse keeper.’</p>
<p>“He called the storehouse keeper and asked him, ‘My good man, is there enough food for me, my attendants, and a thousand mendicants to survive for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, there is, Master,’ answered the storehouse keeper.</p>
<p>“The householder Saṃdhāna then made a promise to those five hundred self-awakened ones and asked, ‘When is your mealtime?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It is before noon.’ they replied.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the householder Saṃdhāna had an offering hall built and appointed managers of the offerings and also persons to announce the mealtimes. He had almsfood offered to the thousand self-awakened ones every day.</p>
<p>“The famine continued and never ceased. At a certain point, the householder asked the self-awakened ones, ‘Noble ones, will it rain?’</p>
<p>“ ‘It will rain.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Should I sow seeds?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, sow them.’</p>
<p>“And so they did sow seeds. The knowledge of Śakra, Lord of the Gods, works downward, so he thought, ‘In the world, the best of all those worthy of veneration are self-awakened ones,  and the best of all donors is the householder Saṃdhāna. So I will help them.’</p>
<p>“Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, caused a greatly powerful rain, and the seeds sprang up as gourds. Then the people asked the self-awakened ones, ‘Noble ones, our seeds that have grown sprang up as gourds. What should we do about them?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Do not cut them but grow them,’ they answered.</p>
<p>“When they grew the gourds, each plant blossomed, producing a fruit as large as a pot. They explained this in detail to the self-awakened ones. They were then told, ‘You should not cut them. They will burst by themselves after having matured.’</p>
<p>“Later, they did burst after having matured. Each of them was full of the same kind of seeds as each person had sowed. When the famine had thereby ceased and there was an abundant harvest, people and other beings who had left for fear of the famine and were living in various other provinces came back to Vārāṇasī. Also, when the famine had ceased and there was an abundant harvest, the householder Saṃdhāna satisfied the thousand self-awakened ones with a pure and fine meal with tasty vegetables and spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Having attained wealth, faith, and insight,</p>
<p>An intelligent, wise man</p>
<p>Always gives gifts,</p>
<p>Being free from attachment.</p>
<p>“ ‘The family of one who offers</p>
<p>Food to the steadfast</p>
<p>Possessed of magical power, splendor,</p>
<p>Beautiful appearance, and fame will prosper.</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus, those who give gifts</p>
<p>To those worthy of veneration and perfect in conduct</p>
<p>Will be happy</p>
<p>In this world and the next.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that householder named Saṃdhāna at that time, on that occasion, who provided almsfood for a thousand self-awakened ones when there was a famine for twelve years,  and whom Śakra, Lord of the Gods, helped, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the householder Saṃdhāna at that time, on that occasion. I provided almsfood for a thousand self-awakened ones when there was a famine for twelve years, and Śakra, Lord of the Gods, helped me.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by these donations or distributions of donations, you should think otherwise; these donations of mine were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>

<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I helped beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once many merchants from the continent of Jambu, jewel seekers, arranged a ship. Wanting to take to the great ocean, they thought thus: ‘Sirs, since, once we take to the great ocean, it is not clear if we will be able to help each other, each of us jewel seekers should now take a life buoy, which will be necessary in case of danger, and take to the great ocean.’</p>
<p>“And so, each of the jewel seekers did take his own life buoy, which would be necessary in case of danger—some took a shield made from the silk-cotton tree, some a wadded bag, some stringed gourds, and some a bag made of goat skin—and they then took to the great ocean. When they arrived in the middle of the great ocean, the ship was broken up by a makara. After the ship had been broken up, each of them rode his own life buoy and was carried by the current.  Wind caused by the maturation of their karma arose from the north and brought them to a shore in the south. There were women there who were well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. They said, ‘Come, masters. Come, sirs. Be masters to us who have no masters, husbands to us who have no husbands, homes to us who have no homes, islands to us who have no islands, protectors to us who have no protectors, refuges to us who have no refuges, support to us who have no support. These are your houses for food, houses for drink, houses for clothes, houses for bedding, parks for pleasure, forests for pleasure, ponds for pleasure, and many treasures from the continent of Jambu: jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, glass, coral, silver, gold, agate, amber, rubies, and dextral shells. You should come. Play, make love, and enjoy yourselves with us. But none of you should go to the southern road, even if he becomes mad.’</p>
<p>“They and the women played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, sons and daughters were born.</p>
<p>“Thereupon a certain merchant of a wise nature thought, ‘Why do those women especially guard the southern road? I will now make sure that the woman with whom I sleep has fallen asleep, get down from the bed carefully and slowly, and go to the southern road.’</p>
<p>“Having thus decided,  he made sure that the woman with whom he slept had fallen asleep, got down from the bed carefully and slowly, and went to the southern road, carrying a sharp sword under his arm.</p>
<p>“He heard the lamenting voices of many people there: ‘Alas, mother! Alas, father! Alas, sister! Alas, brother! Alas, the beautiful continent of Jambu! Have they abandoned us while the continent of Jambu is said to remain happy?’ Having heard this, he was frightened, upset, and dumbfounded. Then, after being frightened, upset, and dumbfounded, the merchant took heart and went along the southern road. He saw there a big, towering, vast iron castle. He walked around the castle, and although he had done so, thinking, ‘By all means, I must find some entrance,’ he did not find even an entrance through which a cat or a snake could slip in. He did see there was a big, tall tree called śirīṣa there. Then the wise-natured merchant carefully climbed the śirīṣa tree and called out to the many people, ‘Sirs, why are you lamenting “Alas, mother! Alas, father! Alas, sister! Alas, brother! Alas, the beautiful continent of Jambu! Have they abandoned us while the continent of Jambu is said to remain happy?” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good sir,’ they answered, ‘we are many merchants, jewel seekers, from the continent of Jambu. We arranged a ship and, wanting to take to the great ocean, we thought, “Sirs, since, once we take to the great ocean, it is not clear if we will be able to help each other, each of us jewel seekers should now take a life buoy, which will be necessary in case of danger, and take to the great ocean.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus, each of the jewel seekers did take his own life buoy, which would be necessary in case of danger—some  took a shield made from the silk-cotton tree, some a wadded bag, some stringed gourds, and some a bag made of goat skin—and we took to the great ocean. When we arrived in the middle of the great ocean, the ship was broken up by a makara. After the ship was broken up, each of us rode his own life buoy and was carried by the current. Wind caused by the maturation of our karma arose from the north and brought us to a shore in the south. There were women there who were well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. They said, “Come, masters. Come, sirs. Be masters to us who have no masters, husbands to us who have no husbands, homes to us who have no homes, islands to us who have no islands, protectors to us who have no protectors, refuges to us who have no refuges, support to us who have no support. These are your houses for food, houses for drink, houses for clothes, houses for bedding, parks for pleasure, forests for pleasure, ponds for pleasure, and many treasures from the continent of Jambu, namely, jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shells, glass, coral, silver, gold, agate, amber, rubies, and dextral shells. You should come. Play, make love, and enjoy yourselves with us. But none of you should go to the southern road, even if he becomes mad.”</p>
<p>“ ‘We and the women played, made love, and enjoyed ourselves.  Thus, sons and daughters were born.</p>
<p>“ ‘We and the women played, made love, and enjoyed ourselves until they heard of a ship of other merchants from the continent of Jambu. When they heard that another group of many merchants from the continent of Jambu had arrived in the middle of the ocean and their ship had been broken up by a makara, they came to us and ate some of us. When they eat a man, they leave nothing, eating even the hair, body hair, nails, and teeth. When they eat, if a drop of blood is spilled on the ground, they even dig that out with their fingers and put it into their mouths with the soil. The rest of us were confined in this iron castle. O good sir, these women are not human. They are rākṣasīs. So, protect yourself from them.’</p>
<p>“Having been told this, the wise-natured merchant asked these many people, ‘Is there any good means whereby you and we can safely and securely return to the continent of Jambu?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good sir,’ they answered, ‘first, there is no means for us whereby we can safely and securely return to the continent of Jambu. Why? If we think, “Oh, let’s climb over this iron castle and escape,” the castle becomes two or three times taller. If we think, “Oh, let’s break the side of this iron castle and escape,” the castle becomes two or three times thicker. Thus, there is no means for us whereby we can safely and securely  return to the continent of Jambu. However, there is a means whereby you can return to the continent of Jambu again. We here have heard gods flying through the air utter these words: “Alas, merchants from the continent of Jambu! On the day of poṣadha that is the fifteenth of the month, on the northern secret path, Bālāha, the king of horses, eats rice that does not need plowing or sowing and becomes comfortable, free from illness, and strong. His faculties having become perfect, he raises his head and speaks an inspired utterance: ‘Is there anyone going to the farther shore? Whom shall I lead to the farther shore? Whom shall I take to the continent of Jambu safely and securely?’ It would be foolish not to go.” You should go to the horse and say, “We are going to the farther shore. We are going to the farther shore. Please lead us to the farther shore and take us to the continent of Jambu safely and securely.” ’</p>
<p>“Then, having well grasped and understood what the many people had said, the wise-natured merchant descended from the śirīṣa tree slowly and carefully. He went back along that southern road, confirmed that the woman with whom he slept was asleep in bed, and lay down slowly and carefully. Then, after the night had passed, the wise-natured merchant rose in the morning and went to the many merchants from the continent of Jambu. When he arrived, he said to the many merchants from the continent of Jambu, ‘Sirs, come to the beautiful park immediately. I have something to talk about with you in confidence. Therefore, you should not tell anyone, nor should you bring your sons or daughters. Sirs, please do as I say.’</p>
<p>“The many merchants from the continent of Jambu heard this, and thereupon they went to the beautiful park.  Then the wise-natured merchant told the many merchants from the continent of Jambu everything about the conversation he had had with those many people and said, ‘These women are not humans, but rākṣasīs. Thus, sirs, protect yourselves from them.’</p>
<p>“Then, just as they had been told, on the day of poṣadha that is the fifteenth of the month, the many merchants from the continent of Jambu went to the northern secret path where Bālāha, the king of horses, ate rice that does not need plowing or sowing and became comfortable, free from illness, and strong. His faculties having become perfect, he raised his head and spoke an inspired utterance: ‘Is there anyone going to the farther shore? Whom shall I lead to the farther shore? Whom shall I take to the continent of Jambu safely and securely?’ When a certain merchant from a family of stablemen saw Bālāha, the king of horses, from a distance, he said to the many merchants from the continent of Jambu, ‘Sirs, over there is Bālāha, the king of horses. Let us go there and say, “We are going to the farther shore. We are going to the farther shore. Please lead us to the farther shore and take us to the continent of Jambu safely and securely.” ’</p>
<p>“Then the wise-natured merchant said to the many merchants from the continent of Jambu, ‘Sirs, as far as I understood from what those many people said, it is not the time for us to go to Bālāha, the king of horses, and say, “We are going to the farther shore. We are going to the farther shore. Please lead us to the farther shore and take us to the continent Jambu safely and securely.” When Bālāha, the king of horses, has eaten rice that does not need plowing or sowing . . . .   “Whom shall I take to the continent Jambu safely and securely,” it is the time for us to go to Bālāha, the king of horses, and thus say, “We are going to the farther shore. We are going to the farther shore. Please lead us to the farther shore and take us to the continent Jambu safely and securely.” ’</p>
<p>“Thereupon Bālāha, the king of horses, ate rice that does not need plowing or sowing . . . . ‘Whom shall I take to the continent of Jambu safely and securely?’ Then the many merchants from the continent of Jambu draped their upper robes over one shoulder, fell on their right knees, made the gesture of supplication to Bālāha, the king of horses, and said to him, ‘We are going to the farther shore. We are going to the farther shore. Please lead us to the farther shore and take us to the continent of Jambu safely and securely.’</p>
<p>“Then Bālāha, the king of horses, taught and instructed well the many merchants from the continent of Jambu, ‘Sirs, those women will come, looking very well proportioned, very attractive, and very pleasant to behold, bringing their sons and daughters, and say, “Come, masters. Come, sirs. . . . Play, make love, and enjoy yourselves with us. But if someone has told you something, and you do not want us, take your own children with you.” If some of you there conceive thoughts of “my wife,” “son,” “daughter”; “my house for food,” “house for drink,” “house for clothes,”  “house for bedding”; or “park for pleasure, pond for pleasure, and many treasures from the continent of Jambu: jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, . . . , and dextral shells,” you will fall down just as ripe fruits separate from the stalk even if you are on my neck or back, and those women will come and eat you. When they eat a man, if a drop of blood is spilled on the ground, they even dig that out with their fingers and put it into their mouths with the soil. If some of you do not think of “my wife,” “son,” “daughter” . . . or “dextral shells,” you will never fall even if you are holding only one ten-millionth of my mane. You will arrive at the continent of Jambu safely and securely.’</p>
<p>“Then, having taught and instructed well the many merchants from the continent of Jambu, Bālāha, the king of horses, lowered his back. Some of the many merchants from the continent of Jambu held on to the torso of Bālāha, the king of horses, some the back, some the neck, and some the tail. Bālāha, the king of horses, then gradually increased his physical power, strength, and effort and flew up from there into the sky.</p>
<p>“Then the women, who were very well proportioned, very attractive, and very pleasant to behold, came, bringing their sons and daughters, and said, ‘Come, masters. Come, sirs. . . . Play, make love, and enjoy yourselves with us. But it seems someone has told you something. If you do not want us, take your own children with you.’  There those who conceived the thought of ‘my wife,’ ‘son,’ ‘daughter,’ or ‘my house for food . . . , and dextral shells’ fell down, just as ripe fruits separate from the stalk, while they were on the neck or back of Bālāha, the king of horses. Those women rushed at them, and when they arrived, they ate them. When they ate the men, they left nothing, eating even the hair . . . they even dug that out and put it into their mouths with the soil. Those who did not think of ‘my wife,’ ‘son,’ ‘daughter,’ . . . , or ‘dextral shells’ arrived at the continent of Jambu safely and securely while they were holding on to the tip of the mane of Bālāha, the king of horses.</p>
<p>“Great King, thus, if one thinks, ‘I am the eyes. The eyes are mine. I am the ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The mind is mine. I am form. Form is mine. I am sound, smell, taste, tangible object, and mental object. Mental object is mine. I am the element of earth. The element of earth is mine. I am the element of water, the element of fire, the element of wind, the element of space, and the element of consciousness. The element of consciousness is mine. I am the aggregate of form. The aggregate of form is mine. I am the aggregate of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. The aggregate of consciousness is mine,’ they will experience pain, just like the merchants among the rākṣasīs.</p>
<p>“Great King,  if one does not think, ‘I am the eyes. The eyes are mine . . . . The aggregate of consciousness is mine,’ they will attain happiness, just as the merchants did through Bālāha.</p>
<p>“Foolish people who, relying on the Buddha,</p>
<p>Do not have faith</p>
<p>Will experience pain,</p>
<p>Just like the merchants among the rākṣasīs.</p>
<p>“Intelligent people who, relying on the Buddha,</p>
<p>Have faith</p>
<p>Will go to the farther shore safely,</p>
<p>Just as the merchants did with the help of Bālāha.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? If you think that the one who was Bālāha, the king of horses, at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the king of horses named Bālāha at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, then you should think otherwise; that I benefited beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>2. A King</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I helped beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there lived near Vārāṇasī a merciful ṛṣi of a loving nature; he loved beings. Near his hermitage, two householders who were farmers were plowing fields, and the two began to quarrel. One became angry, and so did the other. One hit the other, and vice versa. Both of them went to the ṛṣi. One asked the ṛṣi to bear witness for him, and so did the other. The two then went to the king, and the king asked them, ‘Is there any witness for either of you two?’</p>
<p>“One answered, ‘Your Majesty, my witness is a ṛṣi.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My witness is the same person,’ said the other.</p>
<p>“Then the king summoned the ṛṣi and asked him, ‘Great ṛṣi, which of these two first committed a bad act?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied the ṛṣi, ‘if the judgment is given in accordance with the rule of a wheel-turning king, I will testify. Otherwise, I will not.’</p>
<p>“ ‘It will be so,’ affirmed the king.</p>
<p>“Then the ṛṣi said, ‘Your Majesty, one became angry, and so did the other. One hit the other, and vice versa.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Then I will punish both,’ the kind decided.</p>
<p>“The ṛṣi then asked, ‘Your Majesty, did I not say to you, “Your Majesty, if the judgment is given in accordance with the rule of a wheel-turning king, I will testify. Otherwise, I will not”?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great ṛṣi,’ asked the king in return, ‘in what way is the judgment of a wheel-turning king given?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, a wheel-turning king would avoid causing harm and make an effort to bring benefit,’ the ṛṣi replied.</p>
<p>“Then the king told the householders, ‘You two should go. Henceforth, do not do such things.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that ṛṣi, who testified in accordance with the Dharma at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was . . . , I testified in accordance with the Dharma at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I testified in accordance with the Dharma, you should think otherwise; that I testified in accordance with the Dharma was only . . . a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>3. The Snake</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I sacrificed my life to help many beings when I was in the indeterminate class. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there lived a maned lion in a deep forest. When five hundred merchants were traveling along a path therein, a large snake named Like a Noose suddenly rose up, irritated by their noise. It surrounded the merchants, including the heads of guilds, so that they were frightened and prayed loudly to Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, the lord, and so forth.</p>
<p>“When the lion heard their voices, he set off in their direction and saw the snake Like a Noose surrounding the five hundred merchants. There was an elephant calf near him. The lion went to him and said, ‘My friend, a large snake named Like a Noose is surrounding five hundred merchants. Will you sacrifice your life for them?’</p>
<p>“ ‘What should I do?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will stand on my hind legs on your head and strike the large snake with my paws. You will die by the force of my hind legs. The snake will die, struck by my paws. I will die through contact with the poison of the large snake.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do so,’ promised the elephant calf.</p>
<p>“The lion stood on his hind legs on the head of the elephant calf and struck the large snake with his paws. The elephant calf died by the force of the lion’s hind legs. The large snake also died, struck by the lion’s paws. The lion, the king of beasts, died from the saliva of the large snake. Thus, all three died. When the group of merchants departed, a deity said, ‘Since a bodhisattva of the fortunate eon sacrificed his life to protect you, you should first venerate his body and then go.’</p>
<p>“Then they cremated his body and venerated his bones.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that lion, the king of beasts, . . . . I released the five hundred merchants from the large snake, sacrificing my life,  at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I helped beings, you should think otherwise; that I helped beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>4. Two Heads</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I showed love even to one who would kill me. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, the Bodhisattva, when he was in the indeterminate class, once lived in a certain forest as one half of a bird that had two heads and two different minds. One of the heads was named Dharma, and the other Adharma.</p>
<p>“One day Dharma ate the fruit of an amṛta. Adharma ate the fruit of a poisonous tree. Both became utterly mad because of the poison and began to quarrel with each other. One made a negative aspiration: ‘May I kill you, oppose you, and be hostile to you wherever you may be born.’</p>
<p>“The other replied, ‘May I have thoughts of love, benefit, and compassion for you everywhere.’</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? I was Dharma at that time, on that occasion. It was Devadatta who was Adharma.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by that thought of love, you should think otherwise; my thoughts of love were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>5. The Lapwing</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I  saved beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, the Bodhisattva, when he was in the indeterminate class, was once born among the lapwings on the bank of a certain island in a river, and became the leader of five hundred lapwings.</p>
<p>“At one point a certain old lapwing ate the eggs and chicks of the other lapwings. Walking slowly, he then went where there were no other birds and stood with one leg bent. The other lapwings, grieving from the pain of separation from their young, then went to their leader and began to cry in the voice common to themselves. Then the leader, having seen his flock thus suffering, began to inspect the island.</p>
<p>“It is natural that the bodhisattvas’ minds do not decay even when their bodies have descended to inferior states. Having seen the old lapwing walk slowly to a certain place and stand with one leg bent, the bodhisattva suspected him: ‘He is of an evil nature, hostile even toward his own tribe.’ With this thought in mind, he spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Having eaten our eggs, chicks,</p>
<p>And even your relatives,</p>
<p>You stand with one leg bent.</p>
<p>That is, alas, your way of acting.</p>
<p>“ ‘Someone has spoken the truth:</p>
<p>“ ‘Beginning to walk slowly,</p>
<p>Speaking very slowly,</p>
<p>And bending one’s head:</p>
<p>These are the signs of deceit.’</p>
<p>“The old bird thought, ‘This leader knows my mind.’ Having realized this, he sought refuge in the leader. The leader said to him, ‘Uncle, set your mind at peace before the flock of lapwings becomes angry.’ Then the old lapwing ran away, and the lapwings enjoyed peace.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was the leader of those lapwings at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise.  I was the leader of those lapwings at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I helped beings, you should think otherwise; that I helped beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>6. The Parrot</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I helped beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, the Bodhisattva, when he was in the indeterminate class, was once a parrot speaking human language in a certain deep forest. At that time, a king named Brahmadatta was reigning over Vārāṇasī in a manner contrary to the Dharma. Thus the parrot hid in the attic of the king’s residence, and said every day, ‘Great King, do not reign in a manner contrary to the Dharma.’ The king became acquainted with the parrot, who then made the king build five places for ascetic practice and reign in accordance with the Dharma. Thus he gave freedom from fear to every beast and bird.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that parrot at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the parrot that spoke human language at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, you should think otherwise; that I benefited beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>7. The Banquet</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I harbored thoughts of love for one who would kill me. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once a king named Brahmadatta was reigning over a country named Kāśi.  He always desired the country of Videha, and so he became hostile toward the king of Videha. The king of Videha surpassed King Brahmadatta in power, but he did not desire the country of Kāśi and always had thoughts of love, benefit, and compassion for the other king. However, King Brahmadatta, enslaved by desire, wanted the other country, and so he prepared an army consisting of four divisions and went to fight against the king of Videha.</p>
<p>“When he heard about this, the king of Videha ordered that for three and a half yojanas the road be cleaned, all stones, pebbles, and gravel be removed from the entire city, banners and flags be installed, many silk tassels be hung, sweet-smelling censers be set out, sandalwood water be sprinkled, the city be made comfortable with every kind of small flower, and much pure and fine food be prepared. He sent citizens and ministers to King Brahmadatta. When the king heard hundreds of pleasing messages, his desire completely dissipated. He then thought, ‘I will please the king of Videha and return.’ With this thought, he went to the king of Videha. The king of Videha welcomed him with the utmost courtesy, led him into the palace, and satisfied him with good food. He then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘O victor, forgive me, please.</p>
<p>I will always respect you.</p>
<p>If you consider me a friend,</p>
<p>Please have pity on me.’</p>
<p>“King Brahmadatta spoke a verse, too:</p>
<p>“ ‘Having drawn the bow that is forgiveness,</p>
<p>You conquered us</p>
<p>With the virtuous arrow</p>
<p>That destroys anger and haughtiness.’</p>
<p>“Then, after both of them had relaxed together, King Brahmadatta left for his own country.  The people of Videha were released from fear.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was the king of Videha at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the king of Videha at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I overcame arrogance, you should think otherwise; that I overcame arrogance was . . . only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>8. The Turtle</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I acted for the great benefit of beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, the Bodhisattva, when he was in the indeterminate class, was once the leader of the turtles in the ocean. A caravan leader seeking treasure with five hundred attendants arranged a ship and took to the great ocean, but the ship was wrecked by a makara. Though they suffered such a misfortune, the turtle carried the five hundred merchants on his back and they crossed the great ocean.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that leader of the turtles in the ocean at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the leader of the turtles in the ocean at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I helped beings, you should think otherwise; that I helped beings was . . . only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>9. Susena</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once the king of Videha had five hundred ministers. Among these ministers, two brothers named Sena and Susena were their leaders. Sena was always finding fault with Susena and devoted himself to harming him. Susena, though, always devoted himself to benefiting Sena. The king’s ministers and citizens remonstrated with Sena for Susena’s sake, but they were never able to make Sena stop harming Susena. And so the king of Videha bitterly scolded him and banished him from the country. He went to Vārāṇasī and was appointed the leader of ministers by King Brahmadatta. One day he became blind. His younger brother, Susena, heard about this. He asked the king for permission and went to Vārāṇasī, where he opened Sena’s eyes. Many people were pleased with Susena, saying, ‘Although this Susena could rightfully blind his older brother by force, he, the merciful one, opened his brother’s eyes.’</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that leader of ministers named Susena at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, . . . that I benefited beings was . . . only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>10. Merchants</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I helped beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once two caravan leaders were staying in a market. With five hundred carriages belonging to each, the two of them entered a path in the wilderness for the purpose of trade. Both thought, ‘It would not be beneficial for us to go together through the wilderness. We must now divide the travelers riding carriages into two and enter the path in the wilderness.’</p>
<p>“The two then did divide the travelers riding carriages into two  and entered the path in the wilderness. One of the caravan leaders stayed at the entrance of the path in the wilderness with five hundred carriage riders. The other caravan leader entered the path in the wilderness with five hundred other carriage riders. The caravan leader, preceding the merchants, saw singing men, both a chief and his minions, who were dark skinned, whose eyes were big and red, and who were riding carriages drawn by donkeys, their wheels covered with mud. Their clothes were wet, their hair damp, and garlands of white water-lilies were wound around their heads. When he saw them, he asked, ‘You men, has it rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sir, yes. It has rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there. Therefore, you should unload any old grass and water lest it make the animals tired. You will have the use of fresh grass and water, and safely pass along the rest of the path in the wilderness.’</p>
<p>“Then the caravan leader went to his travelers. When he arrived, he said to them, ‘Sirs, please be informed that I, preceding you merchants, saw some men, both a chief and his minions, who were dark skinned, whose eyes were big and red, and who were riding carriages drawn by donkeys, their wheels covered with mud. Their clothes were wet, their hair damp, and garlands of white water-lilies were wound around their heads. When I saw them, I asked, “You men, has it rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there?”</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Sir, yes,” they answered. It has rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there. Therefore, you should unload any old grass and water lest it make the animals tired. You will have the use of fresh grass and water, and safely pass along the rest of the path in the wilderness.” Therefore, let us unload the grass and water lest our animals become tired. Let us have the use of the fresh grass and water and safely pass along the rest of the path in the wilderness.’</p>
<p>“They unloaded the old grass and water and proceeded along the path in the wilderness. But even when a day had passed after they had set off, they obtained neither fresh grass nor water. Neither did they do so after two, three, and seven days had gone by. Then, when seven days had passed, the travelers were unfortunately killed by man-eating yakṣas.</p>
<p>“At the same time, the other caravan leader thought, ‘Seven days have passed since the merchants proceeded.’ With this in mind, he too entered the path in the wilderness. The caravan leader, preceding the merchants, saw singing men, both a chief and his minions, who were dark skinned, whose eyes were big and red, and who were riding carriages drawn by donkeys, their wheels covered with mud. Their clothes were wet, their hair damp, and garlands of white water-lilies were wound around their heads. Having seen them, he asked, ‘You men, has it rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sir, yes. It has rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there. Therefore, you should unload any old grass and water lest it make the animals tired. You will have the use of fresh grass and water, and safely pass along the rest of the path in the wilderness.’</p>
<p>“Then the caravan leader went to the travelers. When he arrived, he said to them, ‘Sirs, please be informed that I, preceding you merchants, saw singing men, both a chief and his minions, who were dark skinned, whose eyes were big and red . . . . Having seen them, I asked, “You men, has it rained on the path in the wilderness, so that there is much fresh grass and water there?” They answered, “Sir, yes. It has rained on the path in the wilderness . . . you will . . . pass along the rest of the path in the wilderness.” Sirs, let us not throw away the old grass and water for the time being until we obtain fresh grass and water.’</p>
<p>“When a day had passed after they had set off, they obtained neither fresh grass nor water. Neither did they do so even after two, three, and seven days had gone by.  The caravan leader saw that the preceding travelers had unfortunately been killed by man-eating yakṣas. Having seen this, he thought, ‘Alas, that caravan leader was foolish. Because of that, unfortunately, the travelers were killed, and so there are none of them here.’ He himself then safely passed along the path in the wilderness.</p>
<p>“The second caravan leader at that time, on that occasion, was indeed myself.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I helped beings, you should think otherwise; that I helped beings was . . . only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>

<p>Parents, Water Born,</p>
<p>Words of the Forest, The Elephant, The Nāga,</p>
<p>And Dhṛtarāṣṭra, etc.</p>
<p>1. Six Tusks</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I harbored thoughts of love for beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, the Bodhisattva, when he was in the indeterminate class, was once an elephant king with six tusks in a deep forest that was full of hills and waterfalls and was beautified by green grass, branches, sāla trees, and palāśa trees. His wife, the she-elephant named Bhadrā, was the best of all she-elephants. When they had left their herd and were strolling together in a certain place, another very attractive she-elephant unintentionally approached the six-tusked elephant king. Then, as she too was endowed with the good qualities of wise ones, the elephant felt attached to her, and so did she to him. She served him, following him when he walked and stopping when he stopped.</p>
<p>“Due to the fault of jealousy, the she-elephant Bhadrā  was unable to bear this, and she started finding fault with the other she-elephant. She was also infuriated with the six-tusked elephant. However, she did not find any opportunity or circumstance by which to get revenge. So at that time, she made a negative aspiration: ‘May I be born where I can kill this ungrateful elephant.’ Having made such an aspiration, she died, throwing herself from a cliff, and entered the womb of the chief consort of the king of Videha. After nine months had passed, a daughter was born. She was raised and grew up. When she reached marriageable age, she was given to King Brahmadatta of Kāśi, and he made her his chief consort. As she harbored a grudge from her previous life, she sent scouts to find the six-tusked elephant. After that, she requested King Brahmadatta, ‘Your Majesty, it is said that there is a six-tusked elephant in such-and-such a place. I would like to ask you for its tusks. May Your Majesty order this of your citizens.’</p>
<p>“The king then summoned hunters living throughout the country. ‘Sirs,’ he ordered them, ‘recently there has been a six-tusked elephant in such-and-such a place, and I need its tusks. So, bring them quickly.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the hunters to King Brahmadatta. Then the leader of the hunters said to the others, ‘Sirs, go about your own business. I will go myself.’</p>
<p>“He performed a ritual of offering, armed himself, and went to look for the elephant, with poisoned arrows in his hand, his bow drawn. When he arrived at the place, he saw the elephant strolling, relaxing with his wife, apart from the herd. About this it is said:</p>
<p>“The most excellent elephant colored white like jasmine, the moon, cow’s milk, or frost,</p>
<p>Who was just like a moving mountain covered with snow,</p>
<p>Was seen by him in a certain place</p>
<p>Where blue and red lotuses grew in the water.</p>
<p>“The most excellent elephant’s faculties were just like the moon,</p>
<p>And his six tusks were elegant like moonlight.</p>
<p>He was just like a mass of white lotuses growing upward,</p>
<p>Standing on their spotless root.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the hunter, dressed in a saffron robe, carrying the bow and arrows under his arm, and crawling through the thicket of vines, slowly approached him. Then the she-elephant saw him from a distance and said to her husband, ‘Your Majesty, let us now go elsewhere because a human is there.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What kind of human is it?’ he asked.</p>
<p>“She answered, ‘He is a man in a saffron robe.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If he has a saffron robe, as you say, do not worry,’ the Bodhisattva said. ‘Evil will not occur from a saffron robe because:</p>
<p>“ ‘This is the banner of those who have a merciful nature and an affectionate mind,</p>
<p>Those who have abandoned the pleasure of killing others.</p>
<p>Just as moonlight only comforts, never radiating any painful heat,</p>
<p>Fear does not arise from him. Tranquility will be obtained from him.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the she-elephant and the Bodhisattva began to walk without fear. Then the hunter in the bush shot the Bodhisattva in a vital spot. The she-elephant said to the Bodhisattva, ‘Your Majesty, was my fear about the robed man realized or not?’</p>
<p>“The Bodhisattva replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Never have malice.</p>
<p>This sin is not of this robe of a muni.</p>
<p>This sin is of one who has abandoned mercy,</p>
<p>His mind ruled by defilements.</p>
<p>“ ‘With mind undeluded, endowed with the power of observation,</p>
<p>Who, at the sight of iron covered with gold,</p>
<p>Would regard that gold as being as valueless as the iron,</p>
<p>Thinking that it deceives people?</p>
<p>“ ‘Understand that what is evil</p>
<p>Is his bow, his arrow, and his evil mind.</p>
<p>Observe with intelligence that this supremely tranquil saffron robe</p>
<p>Is always tranquil.’</p>
<p>“Unable to bear this, the she-elephant said to her husband, ‘Although these words of yours soothe me, I cannot be calm toward the one who kills you. I will tear, pull apart, pierce, break, and rip up his major limbs and minor appendages.’</p>
<p>“Then the Bodhisattva said, smiling, ‘Alas, the attachment of the Bodhisattva’s wife, which nourishes the demon of defilements, is not right. How do you not understand such a thing?</p>
<p>“ ‘The mind of one possessed by a demon, an evil spirit, is perplexed.</p>
<p>The patient does not respect the physician.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the physician does not harm him</p>
<p>But overwhelms and destroys that very demon.</p>
<p>“ ‘Thus this man possessed by the demon, defilements,</p>
<p>Commits a fault, his mind perplexed.</p>
<p>Knowing this, I destroy defilements,</p>
<p>Not those defeated by defilements.</p>
<p>“ ‘My wife, I will attain awakening and fill these three realms of existence</p>
<p>With my fame. The demon, defilements, will soon be conquered</p>
<p>By firm, straight recollection and discipline,</p>
<p>Which destroy, pulverize, cut, smash, dry, and shrivel.’</p>
<p>“The excitement of her heart having been allayed by the Bodhisattva’s words, the she-elephant remained silent. Then the herd of elephants came to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva thought, ‘It would not be right if these elephants harmed this hunter here.’</p>
<p>“It is natural that the minds of the blessed ones, the bodhisattvas, do not decay even when their bodies have descended to inferior states. Thus, he went to the hunter and reassured him. He said in a human voice, ‘Do not be afraid,’ and hid him under his chest. And the elephants made an accusation, but he made them go elsewhere. When the elephants had left, he said to the hunter, ‘Understand, sir,  that the elephants have left. Do what you need to do.’</p>
<p>“The hunter thought, ‘A man like me is the worst. He who was born in an animal womb has trust in me through such good qualities.’</p>
<p>“He then cried aloud. ‘Man, why do you cry?’ asked the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>“ ‘Struck!’ answered the hunter.</p>
<p>“The Bodhisattva, becoming sad, thought, ‘Did I harm him when I protected him? Or did this she-elephant, being unable to bear his attempt to kill me, do some harm to him?’ He asked the hunter, ‘Sir, did anyone strike you?’</p>
<p>“Then the hunter, with his eyes full of a flood of tears, answered:</p>
<p>“ ‘O king of elephants,</p>
<p>Your body was struck by my arrow.</p>
<p>My mind was struck</p>
<p>By the arrows of your good qualities.</p>
<p>“ ‘Bodies struck by poisoned arrows</p>
<p>Will be reborn.</p>
<p>Wise men struck by the arrows of good qualities</p>
<p>Will not be reborn.</p>
<p>“ ‘Who could fully describe the good qualities</p>
<p>Of you, who have such mercy</p>
<p>Even for your killer—</p>
<p>You, who are an ocean of good qualities?</p>
<p>“ ‘I did not even have the intelligence</p>
<p>To know myself to be human.</p>
<p>Having not a single good quality in my body,</p>
<p>I was born in this world as one beset by anger.</p>
<p>“ ‘Though endowed with human flesh,</p>
<p>I have gone to an animal’s existence.</p>
<p>O most excellent elephant, you are human,</p>
<p>Though having an animal’s existence and flesh.</p>
<p>“ ‘I remember that one is not regarded</p>
<p>As an animal or a human only by one’s flesh.</p>
<p>Those who have attained good qualities</p>
<p>Are the ones to be called human.’</p>
<p>“The Bodhisattva said, ‘Your words praising me for my good qualities are interrupting our conversation. Tell me quickly for what purpose you shot me with the arrow.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I committed this act, which should not be done, at the king’s request,’ he replied, ‘There is something to take from you.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If so,’ said the Bodhisattva, ‘above you</p>
<p>“ ‘Stretch both of your hands quickly</p>
<p>And grasp what you want,</p>
<p>For there is nothing</p>
<p>The bodhisattvas would not give.</p>
<p>“ ‘Cut this flesh of mine and take it away</p>
<p>Or take my tusks if you wish.</p>
<p>Since this body was generated out of mercy for others,</p>
<p>Why would I be attached to it?</p>
<p>“ ‘Though able to enter the city of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>I entered transmigration, which is difficult to traverse—</p>
<p>Compassion for others, which is the basis of omniscience,</p>
<p>Was the reason for that.’</p>
<p>“Then the hunter, embarrassed, thought about the king’s request and muttered, ‘What is needed is your tusks.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Pull them out gently and take them,’ said the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>“ ‘May you be gracious to me,’ he replied. ‘I cannot take out your tusks. Why?</p>
<p>“ ‘If I pull your tusks out,</p>
<p>You who are of a merciful nature,</p>
<p>Will both my hands not fall off,</p>
<p>Burnt by the fire of love?’</p>
<p>“ ‘If that is the case,’ said the Bodhisattva, ‘I will pull them out myself and give them to you.’</p>
<p>“He then pulled out his tusks, the roots of which were very deep. Blood spouted from the great one’s body. When he saw this, the hunter drew a comparison:</p>
<p>“ ‘His chest is sprayed by spouted blood because his tusks were pulled out.</p>
<p>His body, the color of which is just like scattered white lilies, is glorious and beautiful—</p>
<p>He is just like a mountain, the summit of which is covered with snow, emitting rays of light,</p>
<p>And now sprinkled with water colored with red ochre.’</p>
<p>“Then the Bodhisattva said to himself, in order to rouse his courage:</p>
<p>“ ‘You should now make your mind steadfast. What use is foolishness?</p>
<p>See the poor, helpless ones in the world.</p>
<p>You are the protector of humans, who are ruled by death.</p>
<p>Thus, it would not be right for you to be discouraged here and now.’</p>
<p>“At that time, the surface of the sky was filled with gods, who were delighted with amazement, and various wonders occurred. Thereupon a god, seeing the difficult act performed by the Bodhisattva, said, ‘Friends, the state of this great one is truly a great wonder.</p>
<p>“ ‘Even though he is overwhelmed</p>
<p>By the pain of pulling out his tusks,</p>
<p>His mind, with its excellent intentions,</p>
<p>Never turns back from awakening.’</p>
<p>“Then another god said to that one:</p>
<p>“ ‘Even experiencing the pain</p>
<p>Caused by pulling out his tusks,</p>
<p>Why would his merciful mind,</p>
<p>Which intends to gladden</p>
<p>Even beings living in hell,</p>
<p>Turn back from awakening?’</p>
<p>“Then the Bodhisattva, having pulled out his tusks and holding them to himself, remained silent. The hunter worried, ‘Why is he holding these tusks of his, not giving them away?’ The Bodhisattva understood his thought and stretched out his trunk, which was just like a white lily flower. He said, ‘Friend, do not worry:</p>
<p>“ ‘I am happy because</p>
<p>I have pulled out these six excellent tusks,</p>
<p>Which are just like a white lily, the moon, and lotus roots,</p>
<p>In order to give them to you.</p>
<p>“ ‘Wait for a while.</p>
<p>Beside you, who are the recipient,</p>
<p>I will meanwhile purify my mind,</p>
<p>Which is tormented by pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘If, having observed me,</p>
<p>You think, “The mind should be purified.</p>
<p>I must understand</p>
<p>Killing to be a shameless monster,”</p>
<p>“ ‘You should despise wrong, evil acts</p>
<p>And the evil bow and sharp arrows.</p>
<p>And, having looked at the saffron robe, which is the banner of the noble ones,</p>
<p>You should purify your mind.</p>
<p>“ ‘One gift is pure because of its recipient;</p>
<p>Another is pure because of its donor.</p>
<p>Therefore, make an effort</p>
<p>To purify the gift with your mind.’</p>
<p>“Then the Bodhisattva, thinking that it was the banner of those who are free from desire, gazed at the saffron robe, and his mind was filled with faith. He gave his tusks and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Although I was shot with a poisoned arrow,</p>
<p>There was no hatred in my heart.</p>
<p>By this truth, I will attain complete and supreme awakening</p>
<p>And liberate miserable beings from suffering.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, Great King? If you think that the one who was that six-tusked elephant king at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the six-tusked elephant king at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I perfected thoughts of love and gave what was difficult to give, you should think otherwise; my thoughts of love and giving that which is difficult were only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>2. The Rabbit</p>
<p>“Great King, again, when I was a rabbit, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I gave my own flesh to a brahmin. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past there lived a ṛṣi engaged in extreme ascetic practices: he ate fruits and roots and drank water, wore antelope skin and bark, and performed fire offerings on a mountain that was abundant in waterfalls, flowers, fruits, and roots. This brahmin had a friend, a rabbit who spoke the language of humans. This rabbit used to go and greet the ṛṣi in the daytime, and  please him with various conversations. Thus, these two grew to love each other like father and son.</p>
<p>“After some time had passed, there was a bad drought, and therefore the waterfalls and rivers dried up and the trees did not bear any flowers or fruit. Thus, the ṛṣi suffered greatly from a shortage of food in the hermitage. He began to collect antelope skins and bark. Then the rabbit, having seen him doing so, asked, ‘O great ṛṣi, where are you going?’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will go to a village and eke out a living with cooked almsfood there,’ the ṛṣi answered.</p>
<p>“Upon hearing the ṛṣi’s words, the rabbit was distressed. Feeling as if he had been separated from his parents, he threw himself at the ṛṣi’s feet and begged him, ‘Please do not abandon me! Consider that those who live at home are corrupt because of numerous evils, whereas those who live in the wilderness are endowed with numerous good qualities.’ Although he repeated this many times, the rabbit was unable to dissuade the ṛṣi. So the rabbit said, ‘If it must be like this, please stay just for today and depart tomorrow as you like.’</p>
<p>“Then the ṛṣi thought, ‘Certainly he intends to invite me for a meal today. Thus, these beings born in animal wombs make efforts to hoard up food.’ He promised the rabbit that he would stay.</p>
<p>“After that, the rabbit made a fire. When it was time for the meal, he went to the ṛṣi, circumambulated him, and begged his forgiveness: ‘O great ṛṣi, since I was born in an animal womb, I did not wish for what was received or discarded. Please forgive me for thus committing a small fault toward you.’ As soon as he said this, he threw himself into the fire.</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin became quite upset.  Shedding tears, embracing the rabbit as if he were his beloved only son, he said, ‘My son, what were you trying to do?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O great ṛṣi,’ said the rabbit, ‘please be satisfied with the wilderness and eke out a living for a day with my flesh. Again,</p>
<p>“ ‘Born in the forest, why does a rabbit not have sesame,</p>
<p>Mudga beans, or much rice gruel?</p>
<p>Please, having eaten my body cooked in a fire,</p>
<p>Stay in the forest of ascetics for today.’</p>
<p>“When he heard the rabbit’s words, the ṛṣi grieved and said, ‘If that is how it is, I will abandon my life here, whatever may happen, so that you are pleased. I will not go to villages.’</p>
<p>“Upon hearing these words, the rabbit was pleased. He raised his head, looked up at the expanse of the sky, and prayed:</p>
<p>“ ‘I have lived in the wilderness</p>
<p>And been pleased with solitary places—</p>
<p>By these words of truth,</p>
<p>O Great Lord, may the gods bring rain.’</p>
<p>“The moment he said this, the residence of the Great Lord (Śakra) quaked on account of the Bodhisattva’s power. Since the knowledge of gods works downward, Śakra investigated what had caused this and found it was the Bodhisattva’s power. Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, caused a torrential rain, so that the hermitage became abundant in grass, trees, herbs, flowers, and fruits as before.</p>
<p>“Thanks to his good friend the rabbit, the ṛṣi stayed there and actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge. After that, the ṛṣi asked, ‘O rabbit, for what purpose did you undertake such a difficulty and show such mercy?’</p>
<p>“The rabbit replied, ‘In the blind world that does not have a leader or instructor, may I become a buddha who liberates beings who have not been liberated, releases those who have not been released,  relieves those who have not been relieved, and completely emancipates those who have not been emancipated.’</p>
<p>“When he had heard these words, the ṛṣi requested the rabbit, ‘When you have become a buddha, please think of me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do so,’ said the rabbit.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “What do you think, Great King? I was the rabbit at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening by the difficult act of sacrificing myself, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>3. Parents</p>
<p>a. The Story of Śyāma</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I carried my blind parents on my shoulders. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past a king called Brahmadatta was reigning in the city of Vārāṇasī.  A righteous king, he reigned in accordance with the Dharma over the country, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people. There was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, or robbers there, illness had abated, and it was abundant in rice, sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo.</p>
<p>“His chief priest had a son named Śyāma, who had mastered the eighteen branches of science, was pious and good, had a virtuous disposition, acted for the benefit of himself and others, was merciful, and respected his parents. He was their only son. The parents grew old and had poor eyesight, and they finally went blind. The parents  requested King Brahmadatta, ‘O Great King, please appoint our son, Śyāma, as chief priest. We will go to the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“Then King Brahmadatta ordered Śyāma, ‘Śyāma, assume the office of chief priest.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Great King,’ he answered, ‘I do not desire the post of chief priest. I would like to serve the old and weak whose faculties are feeble.’</p>
<p>“After that, having abandoned life at home and the post of chief priest as if they were spittle, Śyāma lived with his parents in the forest. Every morning after waking up he offered toothpicks and clean water to his parents. Next, he performed fire offerings for the gods and then entered the dense forest to collect fruits and roots. He brought the fruits, roots, and cool water, and gave them to his parents. Only afterward did he go off to one side and devote himself to dhyāna. He spent his time occupied with this series of tasks. One day, he woke up in the morning, paid homage at his parents’ feet, and explained what he had lucidly seen in a dream:</p>
<p>“ ‘I saw in my dream</p>
<p>A black snake eat up my body,</p>
<p>And myself caught in a black noose</p>
<p>And taken southward.</p>
<p>“ ‘I saw this terrifying dream.</p>
<p>Thus, in my heart, fear arose</p>
<p>That an unbearable event would befall me today,</p>
<p>Which is separation from my masters.’</p>
<p>“After that, calmed by his parents, he sat down facing the sun, prayed with an appeal to truth, and went to draw water, carrying a water jar. At that time, King Brahmadatta had gone deer hunting and entered the forest of ascetics. The king was able to shoot at a sound. Hearing a sound like that of a deer, he fully drew his bow  and shot an arrow, which pierced through Śyāma’s heart. Since a vital spot had been shot with the arrow, he fell to the ground. However, without any regard for his own pain, he grieved only for his parents:</p>
<p>“ ‘The three of us, namely, I and my parents,</p>
<p>Whose faculties are impaired,</p>
<p>Will all be killed</p>
<p>Because one single arrow was shot.’</p>
<p>“When he heard this, the king approached and asked, ‘Why will three people be killed because one single arrow of mine was shot?’</p>
<p>“Śyāma, weeping, answered the king in a piteous voice:</p>
<p>“ ‘Both my parents, who are much weaker than me,</p>
<p>Are blind.</p>
<p>Therefore, three people will die</p>
<p>Because I was shot with this arrow.’</p>
<p>“Then the king, alarmed and frightened, said to Śyāma, ‘O young brahmin, I have committed a sin. I, without knowing this, shot the arrow. So please ask your parents not to lay a curse on me.’</p>
<p>“Śyāma respectfully reassured the king: ‘O Great King, if I and my family have any ability, it is rather the ability to show mercy, love people, and consider the next life. So, you need not be afraid of any curse.’</p>
<p>“Further, he said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Please take this water jar</p>
<p>To my masters.</p>
<p>This will be the last time</p>
<p>To wash their feet.</p>
<p>“ ‘Please pay homage at their feet on my behalf and say, “Soon we will certainly part from each other at last.”</p>
<p>“Then the king, carrying the water jar himself, proceeded through the forest. At that time, large demons were making noises in every direction. The two blind people said to each other, ‘This Śyāma has been on the bank of the pond for a long time.’ Then his mother said:</p>
<p>“ ‘My Śyāma is now playing</p>
<p>With animals</p>
<p>In the pond that is full of padma and utpala,</p>
<p>Where haṃsas are singing in a beautiful voice.’</p>
<p>“After that, the king arrived. When they heard his footsteps, the ṛṣis said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Śyāma, our beloved who is pleasing to the eye,</p>
<p>Although you are entering inside,</p>
<p>Why do you oppress your parents</p>
<p>Who are weak and overwhelmed by hunger?’</p>
<p>“The king felt sad and said in a piteous voice, ‘I am not Śyāma but King Brahmadatta.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Welcome! Are you well?</p>
<p>Please sit down on this seat.</p>
<p>Śyāma will be here soon,</p>
<p>Bringing water and fruits.</p>
<p>“ ‘O master of the people, Śyāma has good qualities</p>
<p>And is of a loving nature.</p>
<p>Because of his power of love,</p>
<p>Animals and birds stay here.’</p>
<p>“The king then threw himself at the feet of the ṛṣis and, shedding tears, said in a trembling voice, ‘Śyāma was shot with an arrow in the heart in this forest and is in the final moments of his life. He has sent this water jar filled with water. Both of you, please wash your feet with this for the last time.’</p>
<p>“When they heard this, the two fainted and fell to the ground. King Brahmadatta poured water over them to revive them. The two then wept and said in piteous voices, ‘O Great King, we will die, too, because of his death. Anyway, please take us to the place where he is. Please, by any means, let us arrive before our boy dies.’</p>
<p>“And so the king took the couple to that place. Śyāma was in the final moments of his life. His parents stroked Śyāma’s body and cried out:</p>
<p>“ ‘By whom was our beloved one struck down?</p>
<p>By whom was this excellent tree cut down?’</p>
<p>“Then the king threw himself at their feet and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘When I was walking in the forest,</p>
<p>I shot this only son of yours</p>
<p>With that arrow—</p>
<p>An evil action.’</p>
<p>“At which point the parents, speaking in piteous voices, uttered a statement of truth:</p>
<p>“ ‘Son, by the truth</p>
<p>That you served your parents</p>
<p>And performed fire offerings to the gods,</p>
<p>May your poison be allayed!’</p>
<p>“Then the residence of Śakra, Lord of the Gods, quaked. He pondered why it had quaked and saw that the Bodhisattva of the fortunate eon had been shot in a vital spot and was suffering from poison. He then descended from his residence and scattered nectar. The wound closed and, through the parents’ truthful words and the power of the Lord of the Gods, the potency of the poison was allayed without pain. Released completely from pain, Śyāma then served his parents for a long time.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “What do you think, Great King? It was I who was that Śyāma at that time, on that occasion. Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I served my parents, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>b. Breaking Wrong Laws</p>
<p>“Great King, again I benefited beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“When, convinced that they were following certain laws, worldly people starved their parents and made them enter fire or water, I completely broke those wrongful laws.”</p>
<p>4. Water Born</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I established many disciples in the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.  Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“ Great King, once in the past a king named Brahmadatta, in the city of Vārāṇasī, reigned over the country as if it were his only son. It was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people; there was no fighting, combat, dispute, strife, or robbers; illness had abated; and it was abundant in rice, sugarcane, cattle, and buffalo.  The wife of that King Brahmadatta was called Brahmāvatī. There was also a pond called Brahmāvatī.</p>
<p>“ Being sonless and wanting a son, King Brahmadatta prayed to Śiva, Varuṇa, Kubera, Śakra, Brahmā, and so forth. He also prayed to other special gods, namely, the gods of parks, the gods of forests, the gods of crossroads, the gods of three-forked roads, the gods accepting oblations, and the gods who had been born at the same time as him, who were harmonious with the Dharma, and who always followed him.</p>
<p>“ In this world, it is said that sons and daughters are born on account of prayers, but this is not true. If such a thing were true, each person would have a thousand sons just like a wheel-turning king. Rather, sons and daughters are born because three conditions are satisfied. What are the three? Affected by passion the parents have intercourse, the mother is healthy and in her fertile period, and a gandharva is around and wants to enter the womb. When these three conditions are satisfied, sons and daughters are born.</p>
<p>“When he was thus devoting himself to prayer, a living being who had formed an aspiration for complete and supreme awakening  and was firmly keeping his promise died in hell and entered Queen Brahmāvatī’s womb.</p>
<p>“ A certain kind of woman of an intelligent nature has five special characteristics. What are the five? She knows if a man is affected by passion or free from passion, she knows the appropriate time and menstrual cycle, she knows that the embryo has entered the womb, she knows from whom it has entered, and she knows whether it is a boy or a girl: if it is a boy, it resides on the right side, and if it is a girl, it resides on the left side.</p>
<p>“Being very pleased, she said to her husband, ‘My dear, I am pregnant. Since the fetus resides on the right side, it is certainly a boy. Be delighted!’</p>
<p>“ He too was very pleased and spoke an inspired utterance: ‘I will see the face of my son, which I have desired for a long time. May he be born as a suitable son for me, not an unsuitable one. May he take over my work. May he feed me, after having been fed himself. May he inherit my property. May my family lineage last for a long time. When we have died and passed away, may he give donations and make merit for us, either large or small, and assign the rewards of the offerings to our names, saying, “May this go to where those two are reborn and follow them.” ’</p>
<p>“Knowing that she was pregnant, he arranged everything so that, until the fetus in the womb was mature, she stayed on the terrace, provided with the requisites for cold when it was cold; requisites for heat when it was hot; foods prescribed by physicians that were not too cold, hot, bitter, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, or astringent; foods that were free from bitter, sour, salty, sweet,  spicy, and astringent ingredients; and short necklaces and long necklaces. With her body covered with ornaments, she moved from one couch to another, from one stool to another, never descending to the ground, as if she were a celestial nymph strolling in the Nandana Grove. She never heard any unpleasant sounds, and she felt free.</p>
<p>“One day Queen Brahmāvatī conceived this desire: ‘Ah, I wish that His Majesty would give donations and make merit at the east gate of the city, do so in the south, west, north, and middle of the city and at the three-forked roads, and free every prisoner.’</p>
<p>“Upon hearing this from Queen Brahmāvatī, King Brahmadatta did give donations and made merit at the east gate of the city, in the south, west, north, and middle of the city and at the three-forked roads, and free every prisoner.</p>
<p>“Again, Queen Brahmāvatī conceived a desire: ‘Ah, I wish that I and His Majesty would play, amuse ourselves, and enjoy ourselves under the roof of a big boat on Brahmāvatī Pond.’</p>
<p>“Upon hearing this from Queen Brahmāvatī, King Brahmadatta and she did play, amuse themselves, and enjoy themselves under the roof of a big boat on Brahmāvatī Pond. On that boat, a son was born who was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, attractive, gold in complexion, with a head like a parasol, long arms, a broad forehead, eyebrows that meet, a prominent nose, and the memory of former lives.</p>
<p>“When he was born, his kinsmen  met together and held a great celebration of the birth for twenty-one days in order to give a name to the baby, saying, ‘What name shall we give this boy?’</p>
<p>“ ‘As the boy was born on the water, he should be named Water Born.’</p>
<p>“Prince Water Born was entrusted to eight nurses: two nurses to hold the baby on their laps, two nurses to suckle the baby, two nurses to wipe excrement off the baby’s body, and two nurses to play with the baby. The eight nurses raised him on milk, fermented milk, butter, butter oil, liquid butter oil, and other special foods, and he soon grew like a lotus that shoots up in a pond.</p>
<p>“After that, Prince Water Born thought, ‘From where was I reborn? From hell. What karma of mine caused me to be born in hell? I performed the duties of a crown prince for sixty years. Where have I been born now? I have been born into a family of human kings. If I again rule the country, I will again go to hell. By any means, I must devise a plan.’ With this thought, he pretended to be lame.</p>
<p>“On the day that Prince Water Born was born, sons were born to five hundred ministers, too. After that, these boys came to meet King Brahmadatta every day. Later, the boys became able to jump and run, and King Brahmadatta thought, ‘If Prince Water Born were not lame, he would now be able to jump and run, too. But, lame as he is, I will enthrone him.’</p>
<p>“Then Prince Water Born thought, ‘This king takes what is meaningless to be important. So, I will now pretend to be mute.’</p>
<p>“Devising a means to do so, he then pretended to be mute. Later,  the other boys began to understand words, and King Brahmadatta thought, ‘If Prince Water Born were not mute, he would now understand words, too.’ His name Prince Water Born disappeared, and he came to be known as Prince Mūkapaṅgu (Mute and Lame).</p>
<p>“Later, one day, King Brahmadatta was plunged into grief, resting his cheek on his hand. His ministers asked, ‘Your Majesty, why are you plunged into grief, resting your cheek on your hand?’</p>
<p>“The king answered, ‘Although now I have attained this throne, if I have no son or daughter, my line will end after my death. My only son is mute and lame. How can I help being plunged into grief now?’</p>
<p>“The ministers summoned physicians. The physicians examined the prince and said, ‘Your Majesty, this prince has keen faculties, and we do not see any kind of illness in him. Just frighten him.’</p>
<p>“Then King Brahmadatta called his executioners and instructed them secretly, ‘My son, Prince Mūkapaṅgu, should appear to be abandoned in public, but you should not kill him.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“Having thus replied to King Brahmadatta, the executioners put Prince Mūkapaṅgu on a chariot and took him to the middle of Vārāṇasī. Then, when he had seen Vārāṇasī’s riches and prosperity, Prince Mūkapaṅgu asked, ‘Is this Vārāṇasī empty? Or is there anyone living here?’</p>
<p>“The executioners brought Prince Mūkapaṅgu to the king and reported, ‘Your Majesty, the prince spoke such-and-such words.’</p>
<p>“Then King Brahmadatta put Prince Mūkapaṅgu on his lap and asked, ‘Who should be killed? Who should be struck? Who should be put to death? Who should be given something?’</p>
<p>“Although he asked these things, Prince Mūkapaṅgu remained silent. Again King Brahmadatta said to the executioners, ‘I will completely abandon the prince.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“The executioners again put Prince Mūkapaṅgu on a chariot and took him to the middle of Vārāṇasī. When Prince Mūkapaṅgu saw a dead person, one who had been taken away by death, again he spoke: ‘Did someone dead die? Or did someone living die?’</p>
<p>“The executioners brought Prince Mūkapaṅgu to the king and reported, ‘Your Majesty, the prince spoke such-and-such words.’</p>
<p>“King Brahmadatta again put his son on his lap and asked, ‘Who should be killed? Who should be struck? Who should be put to death? Who should be given something?’</p>
<p>“Although he asked these things, Prince Mūkapaṅgu remained silent. Again King Brahmadatta said to the executioners, ‘I will completely abandon the prince.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“The executioners again put Prince Mūkapaṅgu on a chariot and took him to the middle of Vārāṇasī. When Prince Mūkapaṅgu saw a large heap of rice, again he spoke: ‘If it had not been eaten first, the root of this large heap of rice would have been well settled.’</p>
<p>“The executioners again brought Prince Mūkapaṅgu to the king and reported, ‘Your Majesty, this prince spoke such-and-such words.’</p>
<p>“King Brahmadatta, holding his son on his lap, again asked, ‘Who should be killed? Who should be struck? Who should be put to death? Who should be given something?’</p>
<p>“Although he asked such things, Prince Mūkapaṅgu remained silent. Again, King Brahmadatta said to the executioners, ‘Sirs, I will completely abandon the prince. Quickly dig a hole in the forest and bury the prince today.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“The executioners again put Prince Mūkapaṅgu on a chariot  and went to a large cemetery. When they arrived, they started to dig there. Prince Mūkapaṅgu then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Charioteer, why are you</p>
<p>Hastily digging a hole?</p>
<p>I ask what that hole is for.</p>
<p>Tell me quickly.’</p>
<p>“The charioteer answered:</p>
<p>“ ‘The son born to the king</p>
<p>Is lame and mute, knowing no words.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was ordered to dig a hole quickly</p>
<p>And bury him in the forest.’</p>
<p>“Then Prince Mūkapaṅgu thought, ‘These people are evil: ones with bloody hands, ones attached to killing and murder, ones who take others’ lives, ones who make their living by destroying others’ lives.’ Fearful, he felt faint and thought, ‘These people will kill me.’ He said to the executioners, ‘If His Majesty bestows the most excellent thing on me, I will enter the city on foot and even speak words.’</p>
<p>“The executioners went to the king and reported this in detail. The king said, ‘If the prince wants the throne, I will give it to him.’</p>
<p>“Then, much delighted, King Brahmadatta ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, quickly remove the stones, pebbles, and gravel from the whole city and cover it with a cloud of incense and powder today. Raise banners and flags and scatter petals of various flowers.’</p>
<p>(Masters of the earth accomplish things by their words; gods and meditators accomplish everything as soon as they think of it.)</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the ministers, and they quickly removed the stones, pebbles, and gravel from the whole city, covered it with a cloud of incense and powder, raised banners and flags and scattered petals of various flowers.</p>
<p>“When Prince Mūkapaṅgu entered the city on foot, hundreds of thousands of beings gathered, prompted by curiosity.  After entering the city on foot, Prince Mūkapaṅgu went to King Brahmadatta. When he arrived, he threw himself at the feet of King Brahmadatta and then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘O king of the people, I am not mute, lame,</p>
<p>Foolish, or stupid.</p>
<p>I speak clearly</p>
<p>With clear words.</p>
<p>“ ‘O king of the people, I am not mute, lame,</p>
<p>Foolish, or stupid.</p>
<p>I am endowed with</p>
<p>Complete and keen faculties.’</p>
<p>“The king asked, ‘Son, why did you neither utter any word nor walk on foot?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please listen:</p>
<p>“ ‘I remember a past time.</p>
<p>For sixty years,</p>
<p>I performed, among the people, the duties of</p>
<p>A crown prince of the family lineage.</p>
<p>This matured in an intolerable way—</p>
<p>In hell for sixty thousand years.</p>
<p>“ ‘If I go to hell again,</p>
<p>Remembering the dreadful, intolerable pain of hell,</p>
<p>It would not be right.</p>
<p>Thus I am not pleased with the throne.</p>
<p>Father, please allow me</p>
<p>To go forth now.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son,’ said the king, ‘it is all for the throne that ṛṣis engage in ascetic practices, make offerings, and perform fire offerings. Why would you abandon the throne that is in your hands to go forth?’</p>
<p>“Then Prince Mūkapaṅgu spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not wish to enjoy the objects of desire,</p>
<p>Which are like the fruit of the kimpāka.</p>
<p>I will enjoy the pure life,</p>
<p>Which tastes like the fruit of amṛta.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son,’ the king insisted, ‘all kinds of happiness to be experienced belong to the throne. Why would you abandon the happiness of the throne to go forth?’</p>
<p>“Prince Mūkapaṅgu then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘I do not regard such “happiness”</p>
<p>That produces suffering as happiness.</p>
<p>I do not regard such “suffering”</p>
<p>That generates happiness as suffering.</p>
<p>Father, please allow me</p>
<p>To go to the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“The king said, ‘Son, for now, you should lie without fear of anything on the terrace covered with a cloud of incense and powder, where various flowers are scattered and a soft bed with a beautiful canopy has been installed. Appreciate the pleasant sound of music, wear soft clothes, eat tasty food, and drink tasty drinks. If going forth in the wilderness requires you to lie always on a bed of grass or a bed of leaves under a tree, afraid and uneasy, with dangerous beasts all around—to be frightened by jackals barking, to wear a garment of antelope skin and bark, to eat roots and fruits, and to drink unpleasantly warm and dangerous water—why would you abandon the throne and go forth?’</p>
<p>“Then Prince Mūkapaṅgu spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘It is better to wear bark and antelope skin, eat fruits,</p>
<p>And be with dangerous beasts in the forest.</p>
<p>It is not right for a wise man who is anxious about the next life</p>
<p>To kill, hit, and bind others for the sake of the throne.</p>
<p>Father, please allow me</p>
<p>To go to the forest of ascetics.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Son,’ the king persisted, ‘for the time being, clarify these three questions of mine. It will not be difficult for you to go forth after that. When you saw Vārāṇasī’s riches and prosperity, you said, “Is this Vārāṇasī empty? Or is there anyone living here?” What were you thinking when you said this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please listen. When Your Majesty said that I would die while I was blameless, nobody spoke the appropriate words: “Why will the prince be killed?” Thus thinking, I said that.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good. When you saw a dead person, you said, “Did someone dead die? Or did someone living die?” What were you thinking when you said this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please listen.  Those who die after performing evil acts die as the dead; those who die after performing good acts die as the living. Thus thinking, I said that.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good. When you saw a large heap of rice, you said, “If it had not been eaten first, the root of this large heap of rice would have been well settled.” What were you thinking when you said this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please listen. The peasants borrow rice, eat it, and do their work. After the crops have matured and they have made a large heap of rice, they return the rice to the lender. If that is so, the root of these crops has been eaten before. In the same way, after one attains a human life by the ten kinds of good acts, if the good acts do not increase, one’s previous good acts will be exhausted, and if the roots of the good acts are exhausted, one will fall from that happy life and live in an inferior state of existence. Thus thinking, I said that.’</p>
<p>“Hearing his son’s words, and choking with tears, the king embraced him and said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Accept the steadfast vow and perform your own Dharma.</p>
<p>I too will promise to become your disciple.’</p>
<p>“Then King Brahmadatta asked the ministers, ‘Sirs, if Prince Mūkapaṅgu does not go forth, what will he become?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, he will become the king.’</p>
<p>“ ‘What will your sons become?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, they will become his attendants.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If he goes forth, why would your sons not go forth?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, we will follow your orders.’</p>
<p>“At that time, there was a hermitage near Vārāṇasī, and there lived a brahmin who was naturally loving and merciful, had compassion, and loved every living being. Prince Mūkapaṅgu then went forth with great majesty with his five hundred attendants in the presence of that ṛṣi. The ṛṣi imparted teachings to him, and thereafter, through effort, exertion, and vigor,  he actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Later, the ṛṣi passed away. Prince Mūkapaṅgu heaped up various kinds of fragrant wood, cremated the ṛṣi’s body, and performed a great offering and ceremony for him. Then Prince Mūkapaṅgu imparted teachings to the five hundred young brahmins, and, through effort, exertion, and vigor, they too actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “What do you think, Great King? It was me who was Prince Mūkapaṅgu at that time, on that occasion, who abandoned the throne that was in my hands, and actualized the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited all the beings there and abandoned the throne, you should think otherwise; that I benefited beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>5. Words of the Forest</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I liberated flocks of beasts and birds from the fear of fire. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past there lived a great flock of birds in a deep forest that was beautified by hills, water, green grass, tree boughs, sāla trees, and palāśa trees. Once in that dense forest two trees rubbed against each other, causing a fire. Flocks of birds that could fly flew away. Those that could not fly, and eggs, were left there. At that time, the Bodhisattva had been born as a partridge. When the Bodhisattva saw the large blazing fire approaching from a distance, he  felt great compassion for the other beings. Thereupon the Bodhisattva thought, ‘What use would my life be if I did not make an effort for these beings in distress? I will liberate beings from transmigration.’ The Bodhisattva dampened his wings with his beak and remained hovering in the sky above the fire. Flapping his wings, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p>“ ‘Although these ones have wings,</p>
<p>They cannot fly.</p>
<p>Although those ones have feet,</p>
<p>They cannot walk.</p>
<p>Their parents have flown away.</p>
<p>May this fire not spread!</p>
<p>“ ‘The truthful words</p>
<p>Of one who practices love—</p>
<p>By such truthful words,</p>
<p>May this fire not spread!’</p>
<p>“Śakra, Lord of the Gods, saw the Bodhisattva benefiting beings. When he saw him, Śakra felt sad: ‘What benefit could this one do for them, even by sacrificing himself? This bodhisattva of the fortunate eon will become discouraged about benefiting beings. I will now help him.’</p>
<p>“Śakra, Lord of the Gods, put out the fire by bringing a heavy rain. Thus, all the beings were liberated from the fear of fire.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was me performing the practice of a bodhisattva who was the partridge at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings by my practice of a bodhisattva, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>6. The Elephant</p>
<p>“Great King, again  I benefited beings and satisfied five hundred ministers with my own flesh and blood. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past, in the city of Vārāṇasī, a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country. He had five hundred ministers, but neighboring minor kings won over those five hundred ministers. The king heard of this matter. However, being righteous, compassionate, and eager for the Dharma, the king, who loved people and benefited himself and others, thought, ‘What is the use in killing them?’</p>
<p>“He banished them instead. They went away, and arrived fatigued at a sandy island. They suffered from thirst there, and although each of them searched, they did not find any water anywhere, and they all wailed aloud.</p>
<p>“At that time, the Bodhisattva had been born among elephants as an elephant whose body was well supported in its seven parts, and whose flesh was just like that of the elephant Airāvaṇa. By the power of his merit, there was a valley abundant in flowers and fruits, where there were lakes, ponds, and waterfalls.</p>
<p>“Although he was at a distance, this leader of the elephants noticed those people. He filled his trunk with water and ran over to where the ministers were. He encouraged them, rinsed their mouths with water, put them on his back, took them to the valley, and satisfied them with fruits, roots, and water. After they were well rested, he said to them, ‘There is the dead body of the leader of the elephants beyond this valley. Wash its intestines, fill them with water, collect roots and fruits, and proceed. In this way, you can pass through this highland.’</p>
<p>“Having thus instructed them, the leader of the elephants then climbed a mountain, made up his mind, and formed this aspiration: ‘Just as I protected them from their dreadful pain, instructed them on how to pass through the highland,  and now will sacrifice my life for them, may I realize complete and supreme awakening and liberate these people from the wilderness of transmigration!’ The elephant held his trunk with his front legs and threw himself from the mountain. The leader of the elephants, whose body was large, died just as he fell to the ground. The ministers went there and, when they saw the leader of the elephants, they said to each other, ‘This is the leader of the elephants who saved our lives. If we put our hands on him, will they not fall to the ground?’</p>
<p>“Then the gods of the Heaven of Pure Abode uttered these words: ‘The aspiration for which this great one sacrificed his life should be accomplished.’ The ministers then took out the intestines of the leader of the elephants, washed them, filled them with water, collected roots and fruits, worshiped the dead body of the leader of the elephants, passed through the highland, and later made an aspiration themselves: ‘Just as this great one sacrificed his life to help us and we were saved from this highland, may this great one, having realized complete and supreme awakening, liberate us from the vast wilderness of transmigration!’ ”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, “Great King, what do you think? It was me who was the leader of the elephants at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I sacrificed myself, you should think otherwise; that I  sacrificed myself was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>7. The Nāga</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I satisfied hundreds of thousands of beings with my own flesh, and my heart never sank. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once in the past there was a young nāga called Cāmpeya who was pious and good and had a virtuous disposition. On the eighth and the fourteenth day of every month, he left his abode, practiced the eightfold poṣadha, enlarged his body in an open space, and gave his body away. He did not do any harm to those that were walking and living in the world.</p>
<p>“When a famine broke out, people who lost their work, namely, herdsmen, shepherds, wood gatherers, people who make a living properly, and people who make a living improperly, began to cut the nāga’s flesh and eat pieces of it. During that period I satisfied them with my own flesh many times, but my heart never sank.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was me who was the young nāga Cāmpeya at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I sacrificed my own flesh, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>8. Dhṛtarāṣṭra</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a chief of the haṃsas named Dhṛtarāṣṭra on Lake Anavatapta. He had two sons named Pūrṇa and Pūrṇamukha; the older one was Pūrṇa and the younger Pūrṇamukha. Pūrṇa was fierce, violent, and rough,  and always treated the other haṃsas badly. He plucked the feathers of one, injured another with his claws, and engaged in hundreds of other kinds of harm. Haṃsas would go to their chief, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, to make daily reports. He thought, ‘Pūrṇa is fierce, violent, and rough. If I appoint him as my successor, he will destroy the flock of haṃsas after my death. So, I will devise a plan.’</p>
<p>“He called the two, Pūrṇa and Pūrṇamukha, and said, ‘I will appoint as the chief of the haṃsas he who comes to me first after having seen the banks of rivers, lakes, and ponds.’</p>
<p>“The two then vied with each other to depart with five hundred attendants respectively. Each of the two saw the banks of the rivers, lakes, and ponds, and arrived in due course at the city of Vārāṇasī.  At that time in the city of Vārāṇasī a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country, which was rich, prosperous . . . and full of many people.  In a park in Vārāṇasī, there was a pond of his called Brahmāvatī, which was deeper than a lake. There were various aquatic flowers, and there grew thousands of trees with flowers and fruits in the four directions around the pond. The pond was covered with utpala, padma, kumuda, and puṇḍarīka flowers and densely surrounded by many kinds of trees, and there sang many sorts of birds.</p>
<p>“Having seen the riches of the pond, Pūrṇa, surrounded by five hundred haṃsas, landed and began to enjoy himself, walking around as he pleased. Pūrṇamukha was told by his flock, too, ‘You should land and enjoy yourself as well.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will first accept the throne,’ he said, ‘and after that come back and enjoy myself.’</p>
<p>“He departed quickly  and accepted the throne. Then, surrounded by five hundred haṃsas, he approached Vārāṇasī, landed on Brahmāvatī Pond, and began to enjoy himself. People saw him thus at ease and felt wonder: ‘Hey, where did that chief of the haṃsas, the one with a most attractive appearance, come from? He behaves as he pleases; he is the adornment of Brahmāvatī Pond, surpassing all the other aquatic birds in beauty, and enrapturing worldly beings.’</p>
<p>“All the people living in Vārāṇasī heard about this. They surrounded Brahmāvatī Pond’s rim and watched him, who was peaceful and beautiful. The ministers then informed the king, ‘Your Majesty, the chief of the haṃsas has come from somewhere and landed on Brahmāvatī Pond with hundreds of attendants. He is staying there, surpassing all the other aquatic birds in beauty and enrapturing worldly beings.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs,’ the king ordered them, ‘if that is so, summon bird catchers.’</p>
<p>“They did summon bird catchers, and the king said to them, ‘Sirs, I have heard that the chief of the haṃsas, who is the most beautiful and attractive bird, has come to Brahmāvatī Pond from somewhere. Catch only him with a net, without injuring him, and bring him to me.’</p>
<p>“They caught him with a very soft net without hurting him. He then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Since I have been tightly caught with a net,</p>
<p>Captured by humans, and there is no way to escape,</p>
<p>The flock of haṃsas should go quickly</p>
<p>To Anavatapta by any means.’</p>
<p>“Four hundred ninety-nine haṃsas flew away. Then, caught with a net, he alone remained, stricken by sorrow. The bird catchers regarded him and felt wonder. Being afraid of the king, though, they took the chief of the haṃsas to the king without hurting or killing him.</p>
<p>“One remaining one, not caught by humans but entrapped by the net of love, voluntarily followed them. When the chief of the haṃsas was presented to the king, the king asked them, ‘Sirs, why have you brought this other one, too?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ they answered, ‘we did not catch it, but it came voluntarily.’</p>
<p>“The king felt wonder, and great faith arose in him. Then the king put the chief of the haṃsas on the lion’s seat. The chief of the haṃsas then taught the Dharma in human language so that, having listened to it, the king and his attendants were settled in the ten kinds of good acts. The king ordered his ministers, ‘Sirs, proclaim with the ringing of bells in the city of Vārāṇasī today: “Nobody may kill aquatic creatures in my country.” ’</p>
<p>“They then did proclaim with the ringing of bells: ‘Nobody may kill aquatic creatures.’ ”</p>
<p>“Great King,” the Blessed One concluded, “what do you think? It was me who was the chief of the haṃsas, Pūrṇamukha, at that time, on that occasion. I benefited many beings there.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, you should think otherwise; that I benefited beings was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>I. The Bodhisattva as Four Teachers</p>
<p>1. The Story of the Teacher Sunetra</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings and led them to virtue. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there appeared a teacher named Sunetra, who was a non-Buddhist ascetic, possessed of magical power, and free from desires. The teacher Sunetra had hundreds of,  thousands of, hundreds of thousands of disciples. The Dharma the teacher Sunetra preached to the disciples was not for completely exhausting the cycle of rebirth, becoming completely taintless, or completely cultivating the pure life but for participating in the Brahmā World.</p>
<p>“Among all the disciples of the teacher Sunetra, those who were entirely disciplined and perfected, after practicing the four pure abodes, abandoned longing for the objects of desire, stayed in that state many times, and were reborn as members of the Brahmā World. Among those who were not entirely disciplined and perfected, some were reborn as gods of Nirmāṇarati, some as gods of Tuṣita, and some as members of the gods of the Thirty-Three or the Four Great Kings, or very wealthy kṣatriya families, brahmin families, or householder families.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the teacher Sunetra thought, ‘It would not be right if I were reborn in an equal mode of life, equal birth, equal afterlife to that of my disciples. I will now practice the higher, second dhyāna with love.’ By practicing the second dhyāna, he was reborn as a member of the gods of Clear Light.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that the one who was that teacher named Sunetra at that time, on that occasion, was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the teacher named Sunetra, who was a non-Buddhist ascetic, possessed of magical power, and free from desires at that time, on that occasion. I had hundreds of, thousands of, hundreds of thousands of disciples and preached to them the Dharma that was not for completely exhausting the cycle of rebirth,  becoming completely taintless, or completely cultivating the pure life but for participating in the Brahmā World.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? If you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>2. The Story of the Teacher Mūkapaṅgu</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a teacher named Mūkapaṅgu, who was a non-Buddhist ascetic, possessed of magical power, and free from desires. He was teaching five hundred young brahmins. Then, one day the teacher Mūkapaṅgu thought, ‘Why do these young brahmins not actualize the five kinds of supernormal knowledge?’</p>
<p>“Again he thought, ‘Because they possess extra antelope skin, bark, sticks, water jars, and ladles, and live devoted to efforts aimed at acquiring vegetables and utpala roots.’</p>
<p>“Then the teacher Mūkapaṅgu thought, ‘If I do not make a demand of the young brahmins, it will be difficult for them to break from such a way of life.’</p>
<p>“The bodhisattvas are supreme instructors. And so the teacher Mūkapaṅgu said to the young brahmins, ‘Young brahmins, I will go into seclusion for three months. No young brahmins should come to me except when a young brahmin brings me fruits and roots, or when it is the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days.’</p>
<p>“The young brahmins thereby made an agreement: ‘During the summer, none of us young brahmins should go to see the Master except when a young brahmin takes him fruits and roots, or when it is the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days. If someone among us goes to see the Master during the summer except when a young brahmin takes him fruits and roots, or when it is the day of poṣadha, which is held every fifteen days, he will be regarded by us as having committed an offense.’</p>
<p>“The teacher Mūkapaṅgu was in seclusion there during the three months. No young brahmins went to him except when a young brahmin took him fruits and roots, or when it was the day of poṣadha, which was held every fifteen days.</p>
<p>“Once, when the teacher Mūkapaṅgu saw a deer from a distance, he said, ‘Welcome, deer! Deer, you and I are the same. You are content, completely content, with an amount of food that barely satisfies you, and so am I. But some people here are different, living excessively devoted to efforts aimed at acquiring vegetables and utpala roots.’</p>
<p>“Then the young brahmins thought, ‘Certainly, the Master has accomplished his vow. Thus, he speaks with a deer.’</p>
<p>“Having thought this, they went to the teacher Mūkapaṅgu. When they arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the teacher’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. The teacher Mūkapaṅgu remained silent. The young brahmins again thought, ‘Certainly, the Master has accomplished his vow.  Thus, he speaks with a deer.’ Having again thought this, they asked aloud, ‘Why does the teacher Mūkapaṅgu not speak with humans, whereas he does with a deer?’ They then rose from their seats and departed.</p>
<p>“After that, a certain ascetic, keeping the vow to behave like a deer, went to the teacher Mūkapaṅgu. When the teacher Mūkapaṅgu saw the ascetic from a distance, he said, ‘Welcome, keeper of the vow to behave like a deer. You and I are the same. You wear antelope skin, and so do I. You have one water jar, one stick, and one ladle, and so do I. You are content, completely content, with an amount of almsfood that barely satisfies you, and so am I. But some people here are different, possessing extra antelope skins, bark, sticks, water jars, and ladles and living excessively devoted to efforts aimed at acquiring vegetables, śyāmāka grains, and utpala roots.’</p>
<p>“Then the young brahmins thought, ‘By scolding those who are greedy and praising those who are not greedy, the Master intends to make a demand of us. We will now throw the extra antelope skins, bark, sticks, water jars, and ladles into the ever-flowing water of the river and go to the Master.’ They threw the extra antelope skins, bark, sticks, water jars, and ladles into the ever-flowing water of the river, with their minds filled with joy, adopted righteous behavior, and went to the teacher Mūkapaṅgu. When they arrived,  they bowed low until their foreheads touched the teacher’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. The teacher Mūkapaṅgu knew the young brahmins’ thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature, and preached the Dharma by which the five hundred young brahmins would actualize the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was I who was the teacher Mūkapaṅgu at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>3. The Story of the Teacher Araṇemi</p>
<p>“Great King, again, seeking supreme and complete awakening, I benefited beings through the practice of a bodhisattva. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once, when the human lifespan was eighty thousand years, this continent of Jambu was rich—as narrated in detail in the Dharmikasūtra. The people whose lifespans were eighty thousand years long experienced these kinds of physical harm: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, desire, itch, and old age. When the human lifespan was eighty thousand years, there appeared a king named Kauravya. In King Kauravya’s park, there was the king of banyan trees named Supratiṣṭhita. Under this tree, a very wealthy brahmin named Araṇemi was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred sons of brahmins.</p>
<p>“At a certain point the very wealthy brahmin  Araṇemi went to a solitary place by himself and considered, ‘Human life is short, and we have to go to the next life. Since there is nobody immortal among those who have been born, we must perform good deeds and lead the pure life. However, these people are now indifferent to doing what is profitable, making merit, or performing good deeds. I will now go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.’ After that, the very wealthy brahmin Araṇemi said to the young brahmins, ‘Young brahmins, understand that here I considered by myself . . . I will now . . . go forth. Young brahmins, if I shave off my hair and beard . . . and go forth, what will you do?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, we depend on you, Master, for all that we eat. If you, Master, shave off your hair and beard . . . and go forth, we too will go forth, following you, Master, who have gone forth.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Young brahmins, know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“After that, the very wealthy brahmin Araṇemi shaved off his hair and beard . . . and went forth. The five hundred young brahmins too shaved off their hair and beards, donned saffron robes, and went forth, following the very wealthy brahmin Araṇemi, who had gone forth.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the very wealthy brahmin Araṇemi abandoned the five obstacles to nirvāṇa (here the thoughts of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity should be explained in detail).</p>
<p>“He dwelled, dedicating attention to each direction and suffusing and perfecting it with his vast, huge, immeasurable, fully developed thought of equanimity that was free from anger, wrath, and malice.</p>
<p>“After that, his name, ‘the very wealthy brahmin Araṇemi,’ disappeared, and he became known as ‘the teacher Araṇemi.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the teacher Araṇemi said to the young brahmins, ‘Young brahmins, human life is short, full of distress, does not last long, and, moreover, entails pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, dew lying on the tip of a blade of grass. When the sun rises, it quickly drips off and does not last long. Young brahmins, thus, just like dew, human life does not last long either, but is full of distress and, moreover, entails pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, a painter who draws on the water. The drawn figure quickly breaks up and does not last long. Young brahmins, thus, just like the figure on the water, human life does not last long but is full of distress and, moreover, entails pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, a streak drawn with a stick on the water. It quickly breaks up and does not last long. Thus life, too, is just like a streak drawn with a stick.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, how Mount Cakravāḍa, having been thrown into the water, is quickly removed and does not stay long. Thus life, too, is just like Mount Cakravāḍa.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, a vajra. Having been thrown into the water, it is quickly removed and does not stay long. Thus life, too, is just like a vajra.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, a stick thrown up into the air. It quickly falls down and does not stay long. Thus life, too, is just like a stick thrown up into the air.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, how the more a cloth is woven,  the more the unwoven thread approaches its end. Thus life, too, is just like the unwoven thread approaching its end.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, how an animal being led to its death approaches death step by step. Thus life, too, is just like an animal being led to its death.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, how a person being led to his death approaches death step by step . . . . Thus life, too, is just like a person being led to his death.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, that pieces of meat are put into a pot full of water and then a fire is lit. They quickly become harder and do not stay long in their previous state. Thus life, too, is just like pieces of meat.</p>
<p>“ ‘Consider, for instance, a river that flows down from a mountain, deep, rapid, flowing afar, and carrying plants. You cannot see the water stay or last when days have passed, or even when an instant, a second, or a moment has passed. Thus human life, too, just like the current of a river, does not last long but is full of distress and, moreover, entails pain.</p>
<p>“ ‘Young brahmins, I dwelled with the thoughts of love (the details should be explained), compassion, joy, and equanimity. Young brahmins, you should now dwell with the thoughts of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.’</p>
<p>“Great King, the teacher Araṇemi preached the Dharma to monks throughout his life, for as long as he was alive, and until the end of his life: ‘Human life is short, does not last long, but is full of distress, and, moreover, entails pain.’</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? If you think that the one who was that teacher named Araṇemi at that time, on that occasion,  was someone else, you should think otherwise. I was the teacher named Araṇemi.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>The teacher Sunetra—</p>
<p>The young brahmin Conqueror</p>
<p>And Hastipāla are similar to him.</p>
<p>4. The Story of the Teacher Govinda</p>
<p>“Great King, again, when I was seeking supreme and complete awakening through the practice of a bodhisattva, I benefited beings through great wisdom and eloquence. Listen to that story.</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a king named Diśāṃpati. King Diśāṃpati had a son called Prince Reṇu. King Diśāṃpati was served by a very wealthy brahmin named Govinda, and the brahmin Govinda had a son named Jyotiṣpāla, a young brahmin who was wise, clearheaded, intelligent, and endowed with enough wisdom to behave in harmony with the sacred scriptures. Thus, his father, the brahmin Govinda, used to consult the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla about managing every activity of their farm. He issued every judgment only after consulting the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla, and never acted without consulting him. Jyotiṣpāla was the friend and favorite of Prince Reṇu and six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants, and he was the same age as they were.</p>
<p>“Whenever King Diśāṃpati wanted to play, amuse himself, and enjoy himself, he  entrusted every obligation and every duty to the brahmin Govinda, went up to the terrace without male company, and played, amused himself, and enjoyed himself, to the accompaniment of musical instruments.</p>
<p>“Later, the brahmin Govinda died. When he died, King Diśāṃpati was much distressed and plunged into despair. He said, ‘Alas, it is a dreadful detriment to me that the brahmin Govinda has died!’</p>
<p>“Then Prince Reṇu went to King Diśāṃpati. When he arrived, he asked the king, ‘Your Majesty, why are you so distressed, plunged into despair, and suffering from this distress and despair because the brahmin Govinda has died?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Prince, whenever I wanted to play, make love, and enjoy myself, I entrusted every obligation and every duty to the brahmin Govinda, went up to the terrace without male company, and played, made love, and enjoyed myself, to the accompaniment of musical instruments. I had the thought now, “Alas, it is a dreadful detriment to me that the brahmin Govinda has died!” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, please do not be so distressed, immersed in grief, plunged so into distress and grief. Why? Your Majesty, the brahmin Govinda had a son named Jyotiṣpāla, a young brahmin who is wise, clearheaded,  intelligent, and endowed with enough wisdom to behave in harmony with the sacred scriptures. Thus, his father, the brahmin Govinda, used to manage every activity only after consulting the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla, and never acted without consulting him. He issued every judgment after consulting the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla, and never acted without consulting him. Your Majesty, therefore, please appoint him to the post of his father, Govinda.’</p>
<p>“King Diśāṃpati then summoned the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla by messenger and said, ‘Young brahmin, from today onward, I appoint you to the post of your father, the brahmin Govinda.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly,’ replied the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla. After that, the young brahmin Jyotiṣpāla took over the management of the farm that his father, the brahmin Govinda, had managed. He also took over issuing judgments that his father, the brahmin Govinda, had managed. Thereupon his name, ‘Young Brahmin Jyotiṣpāla,’ disappeared, and he came to be known as Brahmin Govinda.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the brahmin Govinda summoned by messenger the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants and said, ‘Sirs, now go to Prince Reṇu. When you arrive, wish Prince Reṇu victory and long life and say to him, “If you, Reṇu, are happy, we are likewise happy. If you, Reṇu, are distressed, we are likewise distressed. We six kṣatriyas, who are the king’s attendants, are the friends and favorites of you, Reṇu, and we are the same age as you are. When you, Reṇu, succeed to your father’s throne after his death,  please share your property with us.” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, we will do so,’ replied the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants to the brahmin Govinda. They went to Prince Reṇu and, when they arrived, wished him victory and long life and said to him, ‘If you, Reṇu, are happy, we are likewise happy. If you, Reṇu, are distressed, we are likewise distressed. We six kṣatriyas, who are the king’s attendants, are the friends and favorites of you, Reṇu, and we are the same age as you are. When you, Reṇu, succeed to your father’s throne after his death, please share your property with us.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do so,’ replied Prince Reṇu.</p>
<p>“Later, King Diśāṃpati died, and a group of ministers, chief ministers, executors of the king’s law, and those who lived by mantras put Prince Reṇu upon his father’s throne and anointed him as king. After that, his name, Prince Reṇu, disappeared, and he came to be known as King Reṇu. Thereupon King Reṇu summoned the brahmin Govinda by messenger  and said, ‘Think that henceforth you, Master, should teach me just as you taught my father.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly,’ replied the brahmin Govinda.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the brahmin Govinda summoned by messenger the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants and said, ‘Sirs, go to King Reṇu. When you arrive, wish King Reṇu victory and long life and ask, “Your Majesty, do you remember that, when you were a prince, we came to you and said, ‘If you, Reṇu, are happy, we are likewise happy. If you, Reṇu, are distressed, we are likewise distressed. We six kṣatriyas, who are the king’s attendants, are the friends and favorites of you, Reṇu, and we are the same age as you are. When you, Reṇu, succeed to your father’s throne after his death, please share your property with us’?” If he answers “Yes, I do,” say, “Your Majesty, it is the right time.” If he asks, “But who could divide this land, the inside of which is vast and the outer shape of which is like a chariot, into seven?” say, “Your Majesty, none other than Govinda could.” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘Master, we will do so,’ replied the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants to the brahmin Govinda. They then went to King Reṇu and, when they arrived, wished King Reṇu victory and long life and asked, “Your Majesty, do you remember that, when you were a prince, we came to you and said, ‘If you, Reṇu, are happy, we are likewise happy. If you, Reṇu, are distressed, we are likewise distressed. We six kṣatriyas, who are the king’s attendants, are the friends and favorites of you, Reṇu, and we are the same age as you are. When you, Reṇu, succeed to your father’s throne after his death, please share your property with us’?”</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, yes, I do.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“ ‘But who could divide this land, which is vast and shaped like a chariot,  into seven?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, none other than Govinda could.’</p>
<p>“Then King Reṇu summoned the brahmin Govinda by messenger and asked, ‘O Master, can you divide this land, which is vast and shaped like a chariot, into seven?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I can do that easily.’</p>
<p>“Having thus replied to King Reṇu, the brahmin Govinda then reserved the middle part of the land and some of the surrounding smaller areas as King Reṇu’s portion. King Reṇu was satisfied with this, and he expressed his satisfaction thus: ‘The way the brahmin Govinda reserved my portion is just as one who is wise and clearheaded and knows division would do.’</p>
<p>“Then, he divided the other surrounding areas into the portions for the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants. The six kṣatriyas too were satisfied with this, and they expressed their satisfaction thus: ‘The way the brahmin Govinda divided the land is just as one who is wise and clearheaded and knows division would do. The areas that we had been thinking about for a long time are now divided as our portions.’</p>
<p>“Then the six kṣatriyas waiting on the king said to the brahmin Govinda, ‘O Master, please think that henceforth you should teach us just as you teach King Reṇu.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do so,’ replied the brahmin Govinda. After that, the brahmin Govinda taught King Reṇu, the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants, seven very wealthy kṣatriyas, seven very wealthy brahmins, seven very wealthy householders, and forty wives of equal rank.</p>
<p>“He gave lessons in brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins. He also taught many horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen,  swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, princes who were brave and bold like praskandins and great nagnas, worshipers, barbers, and bath attendants.</p>
<p>“Thereupon his name, Brahmin Govinda, disappeared, and he came to be known as the brahmin Mahāgovinda. The brahmin Mahāgovinda was then respected by brahmins as Brahmā, by the king as a god, and by the citizens and provincial dwellers as a king. Brahmins thought, ‘The brahmin Mahāgovinda has seen the path of Brahmā. He has realized and seen the path of Brahmā and completed everything.’ The king, citizens, and provincial dwellers too thought, ‘The brahmin Mahāgovinda has seen the path of Brahmā. He has realized and seen the path of Brahmā and completed everything.’</p>
<p>“The brahmin Mahāgovinda himself thought, ‘I am now respected by brahmins as Brahmā, by the king as a god, and by the citizens and provincial dwellers as a king. Brahmins think, “The brahmin Mahāgovinda has seen the path of Brahmā. Having realized and seen the path of Brahmā, he dwells, having completed everything.” The king, citizens, and provincial dwellers too think likewise. I do not know the path of Brahmā. I have neither actualized and seen the path of Brahmā nor completed everything.  However, I have heard from my father, Brahmin Govinda, that if a brahmin dwelled in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer, Brahmā would come to him. I will now dwell in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the brahmin Mahāgovinda said to King Reṇu, ‘Your Majesty, please look for another teacher for now. I would like to dwell in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, please know it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“He said to the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants, the seven very wealthy kṣatriyas, the seven very wealthy brahmins, the seven very wealthy householders, and the forty wives of equal rank, ‘Ladies, stay at home for now, neither distracted nor careless. I want to dwell in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Dear one, it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“He said to the five hundred young brahmins, ‘Young brahmins, keep and recall the sciences that you have heard, been taught, and accomplished for now. I want to dwell in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“He said to many horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen, chariot riders, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, princes who were brave and bold like praskandins and great nagnas, worshipers, barbers, and bath attendants, ‘Sirs, look for another teacher for now. I want to dwell in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“After that, the brahmin Mahāgovinda had a terrace built in the east of the city and dwelled in the dhyāna of compassion in that solitary place for the four months of summer, but Brahmā did not come to him. Thereupon, a day before the end of the four months of summer, the brahmin Mahāgovinda thought, ‘I have heard from my father, Brahmin Govinda, that if a brahmin dwelled in the dhyāna of compassion in a solitary place for the four months of summer, Brahmā would come to him. However, Brahmā does not come to me.’</p>
<p>“Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, knew the brahmin Mahāgovinda’s thoughts. He disappeared from the world of Brahmā, as quickly as a strong man stretches his bent arm or bends his stretched arm, and went to the brahmin Mahāgovinda’s terrace. At that time, the figure of Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, radiated light, and the vast splendor of his light filled the entire terrace. The brahmin Mahāgovinda saw the vast splendor of his light fill the entire terrace in the second half of the night. Upon seeing it, he spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘I have never seen or heard of</p>
<p>Such a figure.</p>
<p>Who are you, friend,</p>
<p>Who are endowed with such an excellent figure?’</p>
<p>“Brahmā replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Govinda should know me</p>
<p>As he who is known to the</p>
<p>Gods attendant on Brahmā and other gods</p>
<p>As “the Youth.” ’</p>
<p>“Govinda said:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Brahmā, I bow to you</p>
<p>And honor you.</p>
<p>Please listen to my words</p>
<p>And answer quickly.’</p>
<p>“Brahmā replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Govinda, the words you have spoken</p>
<p>Are accepted.</p>
<p>What the purpose of this life is</p>
<p>And what the purpose of the next is—</p>
<p>“ ‘Ask me about these things, brahmin,</p>
<p>Which you have thought about in your mind.</p>
<p>I will answer</p>
<p>Each question you ask.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Mahāgovinda thought, ‘For now I have attained what is to be attained as the purpose of the present life. I will now ask about the purpose of the future.’ He then spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘I ask you, Brahmā Sanatkumāra (Ever Youthful),</p>
<p>This question prepared in my mind:</p>
<p>In what should I persist, what should I learn,</p>
<p>To attain the immortal world of Brahmā?’</p>
<p>“Brahmā answered:</p>
<p>“ ‘Brahmin, abandoning the thought “It is me” among humans,</p>
<p>Dedicating attention to compassion in solitude,</p>
<p>Not possessing the self, which is a stain, and being free from sexual intercourse—</p>
<p>If a human persists in these and learns them,</p>
<p>He will attain the immortal world of Brahmā.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Mahāgovinda thought, ‘I perfectly know the meaning of these words spoken by Brahmā: “Brahmin, abandoning the thought ‘It is me’ among humans.” I also perfectly know the meaning of these words spoken by Brahmā: “Dedicating attention to compassion in solitude.” But I do not know the meaning of these words spoken by Brahmā: “Not possessing the self, which is a stain, and being free from sexual intercourse.” ’ And so then he spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Brahmā, what is the self, which is a stain in humans?</p>
<p>Prevented by what, just as a river by its bank,</p>
<p>Do beings in the whole world remain in inferior modes of existence, have faults,</p>
<p>And remain ignorant of the path to attain the world of Brahmā?’</p>
<p>“Brahmā replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘Anger, dishonesty, resentment, harmfulness,</p>
<p>Greed, being overwhelmed by pride,</p>
<p>Desire, hatred, delusion,</p>
<p>Jealousy, avarice, and spite—</p>
<p>“ ‘Brahmin, these are the self, which is a stain in humans.</p>
<p>Prevented by them, just as a river by its bank,</p>
<p>Beings in the whole world remain in inferior modes of existence, have faults,</p>
<p>And are ignorant of the path to attain the world of Brahmā.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the brahmin Mahāgovinda thought, ‘If I understand the meaning of what Brahmā has said, it is difficult for laymen, who live at home,  to lead the pure life, which is totally pure, unadulterated, complete, completely pure, and clean, throughout their lives. Now I will go forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes.’</p>
<p>“Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, knew the brahmin Mahāgovinda’s thoughts and spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘Rely on efforts here</p>
<p>To be born in the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>These dharmas are the tokens of auspiciousness.’</p>
<p>“Having thus spoken, Brahmā, the ruler of the Sahā World, disappeared from that very place. After that, when the four months of summer had passed, King Reṇu went to the brahmin Mahāgovinda. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the brahmin Mahāgovinda’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the brahmin Mahāgovinda said to King Reṇu:</p>
<p>“ ‘O master of the earth, O Great King Reṇu,</p>
<p>Listen to my words.</p>
<p>Please hold the throne by yourself</p>
<p>For I, Govinda, do not long for it.’</p>
<p>“Then King Reṇu spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“ ‘If any of your desires are not fulfilled,</p>
<p>I will satisfy them for you.</p>
<p>I will kill anyone who harms you.</p>
<p>May Govinda not abandon me.’</p>
<p>“Mahāgovinda replied:</p>
<p>“ ‘O King, I have no unfulfilled desire.</p>
<p>There is no one who harms me, either.</p>
<p>Since I heard the words of a nonhuman,</p>
<p>I am not pleased by being at home.’</p>
<p>“The king inquired:</p>
<p>“ ‘Who is the nonhuman, O brahmin,</p>
<p>Whose words caused you</p>
<p>To abandon me and the objects of desire here?</p>
<p>I ask you. Please tell me.’</p>
<p>“Mahāgovinda answered:</p>
<p>“ ‘When I was practicing dhyāna</p>
<p>On the state of compassion in a solitary place,</p>
<p>Brahmā came before me</p>
<p>And illuminated every direction.</p>
<p>Ever since I heard his words,</p>
<p>I have not been pleased to be at home.’</p>
<p>“The king declared:</p>
<p>“ ‘O brahmin, wherever you go,</p>
<p>I will go there too.</p>
<p>I will become your disciple.</p>
<p>O Govinda, please teach me.’</p>
<p>“Mahāgovinda then instructed him:</p>
<p>“ ‘Abandon the objects of desire</p>
<p>To which ordinary people are attached.</p>
<p>Do not look at the objects of desire,</p>
<p>But dwell in the true Dharma.</p>
<p>“ ‘To be reborn in the world of Brahmā,</p>
<p>Lead the taintless, true, pure life</p>
<p>That is like</p>
<p>The clean gem, lapis lazuli.’</p>
<p>“The king replied, ‘Master, please know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“After that, the brahmin Mahāgovinda asked the six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants, ‘Sirs, what would you do if I went forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, please wait for seven years. After seven years have passed, we will enthrone our sons, kinsmen, or others, and then go forth ourselves, following you.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, seven years is too long. Moreover, you will be attached to the objects of desire. You will be intoxicated by various amusements. Since the end of life is difficult to predict, it is uncertain if you will really go forth or not after seven years have passed. So, I will go forth soon.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, please wait for six, five, four, three, two years or one; or seven, six, five, four, three, two months or one; or seven days. After seven days have passed, we will enthrone our sons, kinsmen, or others, and then go forth ourselves, following you.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, seven days is not too long. But still you will be attached to the objects of desire. You will be intoxicated by various amusements. Since the end of life is difficult to predict, it is uncertain if you will really go forth or not after seven days have passed. So, I will go forth soon.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, please know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“After that, the brahmin Mahāgovinda asked the seven very wealthy kṣatriyas, the seven very wealthy brahmins,  the seven very wealthy householders, and the forty wives of equal rank, ‘Ladies, what would you do if I went forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Dear one, we are queens when you make us queens, friends when you make us friends. If you go forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes, we will go forth too, following you, dear.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Ladies, know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“After that, the brahmin Mahāgovinda asked the five hundred young brahmins, ‘What would you do if I went forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Master, we depend on you, Master, for all that we eat. If you go forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes, we will go forth too, following you, Master.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“He asked the many horse trainers, elephant drivers, horsemen, chariot riders, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, princes who were brave and bold like praskandins and great nagnas, worshipers, barbers, and bath attendants, ‘Sirs, what would you do if I went forth from my home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off my hair and beard and donned saffron robes?’</p>
<p>“ ‘. . . If you go forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off your hair and beard and donned saffron robes, we will go forth too, following you, Master.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sirs, know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“Then the brahmin Mahāgovinda went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. King Reṇu, with hundreds of, thousands of, hundreds of thousands of attendants also went forth from his home into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, following the brahmin Mahāgovinda. The six kṣatriyas who were the king’s attendants, the seven very wealthy kṣatriyas, the seven very wealthy brahmins, the seven very wealthy householders, and the forty wives of equal rank too went forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes, following the brahmin Mahāgovinda. The five hundred young brahmins too went forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes, following the brahmin Mahāgovinda. The elephant drivers, horsemen, chariot riders, swordsmen, archers, servants, attendants, dancers, princes who were brave and bold like praskandins and great nagnas, worshipers, barbers, and bath attendants too went forth from their homes into homelessness with true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes, following the brahmin Mahāgovinda.</p>
<p>“Thus, having gone forth, the brahmin Mahāgovinda abandoned the five obstacles that cause lesser defilements of the mind and reduce intelligence, and which are associated with harm and unassociated with nirvāṇa. He dwelled, dedicating attention to one direction and suffusing and perfecting it with his thought of love that was free from anger, wrath, and malice, and was vast, huge, immeasurable, and fully developed.  Likewise, he dwelled, dedicating attention to the second, third, fourth, upward, downward, and horizontal directions, and all directions of this entire world at once, and suffusing and perfecting them with his thought of love that was free from anger, wrath, and malice, and was vast, huge, immeasurable, and fully developed.</p>
<p>“Likewise, he dwelled, dedicating attention to one direction and suffusing and perfecting it with his thoughts of compassion, joy, and equanimity that were free from anger, wrath, and malice, and were vast, huge, immeasurable, and fully developed.</p>
<p>“Likewise, he dwelled, dedicating attention to the second, third, fourth, upward, downward, and horizontal directions, and all directions of this entire world at once, and suffusing and perfecting them with his thought of equanimity that was free from anger, wrath, and malice, and was vast, huge, immeasurable, and fully developed.</p>
<p>“Thereupon his name, Brahmin Mahāgovinda, disappeared and he came to be known as Teacher Govinda. Then Teacher Govinda traveled from city to city, from town to town, with hundreds of, thousands of, hundreds of thousands of attendants.</p>
<p>“At that time, whenever something bad happened to men or women, they made the gesture of supplication in the direction of Teacher Govinda and spoke an inspired utterance three times: ‘Salutations to Teacher Govinda! Salutations to Teacher Govinda! Salutations to Teacher Govinda!’</p>
<p>“He was the minister of seven kings, and they were as follows:</p>
<p>“Śastrabhū, Brahmadatta,</p>
<p>Viśvabhuj, Earth,</p>
<p>Reṇu, two Dhṛtarāṣṭras—</p>
<p>These seven people were there then.</p>
<p>“He allotted them Dantapura in Kaliṅga,</p>
<p>Potana in Aśmaka,</p>
<p>Mahiṣmatī in Avanti,</p>
<p>And Campā in Aṅga.</p>
<p>“Mithilā in Videha,</p>
<p>Roruka in Sauvīra,</p>
<p>And Kāśi in Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>Were also allotted to them by Govinda.</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was me who was Teacher Govinda at that time, on that occasion.</p>
<p>“Great King, if you think that I attained supreme and complete awakening because I benefited beings there, you should think otherwise; that act of mine was only a cause, only a condition, only a preparation for supreme and complete awakening.”</p>
<p>J. The First Resolution and the First Veneration of a Buddha</p>
<p>5. The Story of King Prabhāsa</p>
<p>“O Honored One, where did the Blessed One form the resolution for supreme and complete awakening for the first time?”</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a king named Prabhāsa. In his country, there was a treasured elephant whose color was white like the flower of a white water lily, whose body was well supported in its seven parts, and who was well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold. One day King Prabhāsa summoned an elephant trainer by messenger and ordered him, ‘O gentle sir, train this most excellent elephant quickly and well, and then bring it to me.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the elephant trainer to King Prabhāsa, and he trained that most excellent elephant. When he realized that it was trained, he brought the elephant to King Prabhāsa and said, ‘Your Majesty’s most excellent elephant is trained. May Your Majesty know that it is the right time.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Prabhāsa mounted that most excellent elephant and, with the elephant trainer seated in front, went deer hunting. Soon the elephant noticed the smell of a she-elephant living in the forest and began to run, tracking the smell. Being carried by the elephant as fast as the wind, the king shouted to the elephant trainer,  ‘Hey, elephant trainer,</p>
<p>“ ‘The sky looks as if it’s shaking, and things in every direction look as if they are quickly crashing together.</p>
<p>The whole earth looks as if it’s turning like a wheel, and the trees look as if they are spinning in space.</p>
<p>The mountains look as if they have suddenly begun to sprint, having seen this lord of elephants</p>
<p>Running like a moving Mount Kailāsa and having thought, “This mountain is running!”</p>
<p>“ ‘Hey, elephant trainer, calm this lord of elephants, calm it!</p>
<p>“ ‘Skillful one, make an effort</p>
<p>To tame this lord of elephants.</p>
<p>I am carried off by an obstinate elephant,</p>
<p>Not knowing what will happen!’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the elephant trainer replied,</p>
<p>“ ‘Even though I try to subdue it with a stick here,</p>
<p>Chanting mantras spoken by the best ṛṣis,</p>
<p>This elephant surpasses me in power</p>
<p>Just as death surpasses medicines for the moribund.</p>
<p>“ ‘Master of the people,</p>
<p>You can never tame your mind,</p>
<p>Carried along by obstinate desire,</p>
<p>With any stick, rope, or whip.</p>
<p>“ ‘Desire, mental pain,</p>
<p>Arises in some way,</p>
<p>Grows in another way,</p>
<p>And is calmed in another way.’</p>
<p>“The elephant trainer was not able to make that most excellent elephant return anywhere. Then he said to the king, ‘Your Majesty, this elephant is mad. Please grasp the bough of a tree.’</p>
<p>“Then the king and the trainer both grasped the bough of a tree and hung there. Having escaped death, they felt safe. The king said to the trainer, ‘You brought the elephant to me untamed.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ replied the elephant trainer, ‘I had completely tamed it, but it refused to obey when it noticed the smell of a she-elephant. However, Your Majesty, it will soon come back, remembering what it was taught.’</p>
<p>“Then, when seven days had passed after the elephant was released from its madness, it did remember what it had been taught and came back to the stable.  The elephant trainer quickly reported this to the king: ‘Your Majesty, that elephant has come back.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You did not tame it,’ accused the king.</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes I did, Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Can you prove that?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, I will show Your Majesty.’</p>
<p>“He brought a mass of heated iron to the training ground and directed the elephant to pick it up. It then tried to pick it up without hesitation. The elephant trainer said, ‘Your Majesty, the elephant can pick it up, but it will die if it really does so.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O gentle sir,’ replied the king, ‘we were tossed about by this elephant, which had been tamed to such an extent. What is the reason for this?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, did I not say to you before that we tame the body, but not the mind? I tamed its body, but not its mind.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Have you ever seen or heard of anyone who tames the mind?’ asked the king.</p>
<p>“Spurred by a god, the elephant trainer said, ‘Your Majesty, those who tame both body and mind are the buddhas, the blessed ones.</p>
<p>“ ‘Many people exert themselves to destroy sin,</p>
<p>Which is caused by desire.</p>
<p>But, after realizing that it is impossible,</p>
<p>They regress, their efforts weakened.</p>
<p>“ ‘Although many such efforts are made</p>
<p>Here and there,</p>
<p>The forest of attachment to the objects of desire</p>
<p>Is not entirely destroyed.</p>
<p>“ ‘Some of those who want to conquer desire</p>
<p>Abandon sensory objects.</p>
<p>Others, wanting to conquer it,</p>
<p>Satisfy their senses with pleasure.</p>
<p>“ ‘Gods, asuras, humans, lions, tigers, snakes,</p>
<p>Ten million insects, butterflies, and all beings in the world</p>
<p>Are turning just like a wheel in this darkness of existence,</p>
<p>Their minds caught by subtle nooses, which are desires.</p>
<p>“ ‘I tamed this beautiful-looking elephant</p>
<p>By various means.</p>
<p>O King, the mind, which has no form and is subtle,</p>
<p>Is not tamed even by a ṛṣi who only drinks water and eats wind.’</p>
<p>“The king asked:</p>
<p>“ ‘O elephant trainer, while the mind, which has no form and is subtle,</p>
<p>Is not tamed even by a ṛṣi who only drinks water and eats wind,</p>
<p>Is there anyone who rules the mind, which has no form,</p>
<p>In the human world?’</p>
<p>“The elephant trainer answered:</p>
<p>“ ‘There is one who rules the mind, which has no form,</p>
<p>In the human world.</p>
<p>O Great King, the Buddha, the one of great power,</p>
<p>The one who has abandoned defilements, the powerful hero—</p>
<p>He and those who follow him</p>
<p>Rule the mind, which has no form.’</p>
<p>“Then, having heard of the effort and power of the buddhas, the blessed ones, King Prabhāsa gave donations and made merit, and he made an aspiration for supreme and complete awakening:</p>
<p>“ ‘By this great gift, may I become</p>
<p>A buddha who, by himself, is born among beings.</p>
<p>I will liberate those who have not been liberated</p>
<p>By the lords of victors in the past.</p>
<p>“ ‘By the merit produced by</p>
<p>Well protecting beings and by giving,</p>
<p>May I attain the state of a buddha</p>
<p>And free worldly beings from the plague that is desire.’</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was me who was King Prabhāsa at that time, on that occasion. There I formed the resolution for supreme and complete awakening for the first time.”</p>
<p>6. The Story of the Potter Bṛhaddyuti</p>
<p>“O Honored One, to which completely awakened one did the Blessed One, seeking supreme and complete awakening himself, offer almsfood for the first time?”</p>
<p>“Great King, once there was a city called Bṛhāvatī, in which there was a potter named Bṛhaddyuti.</p>
<p>“At that time, there appeared in the world a teacher named Śākyamuni, who was . . . a buddha, a blessed one. His two best and wisest disciples were called Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, and his attendant monk was called Ānanda. Once, when the completely awakened one Śākyamuni was traveling, surrounded by a group of monks, he arrived at the city of Bṛhāvatī.  He caught a serious wind illness there and said to the venerable Ānanda, ‘Ānanda, go and bring ghee, oil, and sugar water from the potter Bṛhaddyuti’s place.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, O Honored One,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he went to the potter Bṛhaddyuti. When he arrived, he said to the potter Bṛhaddyuti, ‘Bṛhaddyuti, please understand that the Blessed One has caught a serious wind illness and needs ghee, oil, and sugar water.’</p>
<p>“The potter Bṛhaddyuti accepted the venerable Ānanda’s request, and went to the completely awakened one Śākyamuni with his son, bringing the ghee, oil, and sugar water. When he arrived, he anointed the Blessed One’s body with the ghee and oil, washed his body with mild water, and offered him a drink of sugar water. By these things, the completely awakened one Śākyamuni endured the illness, and his health returned.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the potter Bṛhaddyuti threw himself at the Blessed One’s feet and expressed this aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘By this donation, may I too be born in the family of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>And become a buddha whose good qualities, family, and race are the same as yours.</p>
<p>May I take miserable beings, including those in the world of Brahmā,</p>
<p>To the quiet, vast farther shore beyond death, which is free from fear.’</p>
<p>“His son made an aspiration, too: ‘May I too, by this act, understand the formless dharmas and become the attendant of the Blessed One.’</p>
<p>“Great King, what do you think? It was me who was the potter Bṛhaddyuti at that time, on that occasion. There I offered almsfood for the first time to the completely awakened one Śākyamuni. It was Ānanda who was his son at that time, on that occasion.”</p>
<p>K. The Question of King Prasenajit: The Veneration of Past Buddhas</p>
<p>“O Honored One,  how many completely awakened ones did the Blessed One serve, seeking supreme and complete awakening himself?”</p>
<p>“Great King, in the first incalculably long eon,</p>
<p>“From the Buddha Śākyamuni</p>
<p>To the Leader Dhṛtarāṣṭra,</p>
<p>I venerated</p>
<p>Seventy-five thousand buddhas.</p>
<p>“Throughout the first incalculably long eon,</p>
<p>I venerated victors in the past.</p>
<p>Desiring buddhahood,</p>
<p>My heart was never discouraged.</p>
<p>“Great King, in the second incalculably long eon,</p>
<p>“From the Buddha Dīpaṃkara</p>
<p>To the Muni Indradhvaja,</p>
<p>I venerated</p>
<p>Seventy-six thousand buddhas.</p>
<p>“Throughout the second incalculably long eon,</p>
<p>I venerated victors.</p>
<p>In each life,</p>
<p>My heart was never discouraged.</p>
<p>“In the third incalculably long eon, too,</p>
<p>From the Buddha Kṣemaṃkara</p>
<p>To the Buddha Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>I venerated seventy-seven thousand buddhas.</p>
<p>“In the third incalculably long eon,</p>
<p>When I venerated victors</p>
<p>And practiced for awakening,</p>
<p>My heart was never discouraged.</p>
<p>“When I was a bodhisattva,</p>
<p>I venerated these most excellent buddhas.</p>
<p>All these leaders of the world</p>
<p>Predicted my buddhahood.</p>
<p>“The wishes I once made</p>
<p>Are all now accomplished.</p>
<p>As the Buddha, I relieve burdens</p>
<p>And help beings.”</p>
<p>Thereupon King Prasenajit of Kosala rejoiced in and praised the words of the Blessed One. He bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Blessed One, and then he departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>L. The Question of Ānanda or Section of Many Buddhas</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha, the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“O best of the world, leader,</p>
<p>Muni, may the one of great fortune tell me</p>
<p>Where your resolution for awakening</p>
<p>Was formed for the first time!</p>
<p>“How many buddhas did you once serve</p>
<p>While you were practicing for awakening?</p>
<p>At what time? In which way?</p>
<p>May the best of humans tell me.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ānanda’s words,</p>
<p>The excellent human, the Buddha,</p>
<p>The Muni, spoke about his practice for awakening,</p>
<p>Out of mercy for beings.</p>
<p>“Having heard of buddhas who were free from desire</p>
<p>And having seen the dreadful force of the mad elephant</p>
<p>That is the suffering world,</p>
<p>I formed the resolution for awakening.</p>
<p>“When I was a human king, Prabhāsa,</p>
<p>I wished for awakening,</p>
<p>Made a firm vow,</p>
<p>And gave untainted donations.</p>
<p>“When I was a potter,</p>
<p>Having seen the Buddha Śākyamuni,</p>
<p>I venerated him with ghee and oil,</p>
<p>My first offering directed toward awakening.</p>
<p>“In another past life,</p>
<p>When I was a daughter of the head of a guild,</p>
<p>I saw the Buddha Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>And made a donation of a lamp.</p>
<p>“I once mastered the Tripiṭaka</p>
<p>Of the Buddha Aparājita.</p>
<p>But, quarreling with the community of monks,</p>
<p>I insulted the community by calling the monks ‘women.’</p>
<p>“After I committed that verbal sin,</p>
<p>I immediately became a woman.</p>
<p>My mind was filled with faith again,</p>
<p>And so I attained manhood.</p>
<p>“In another past life</p>
<p>When I was a son of a king,</p>
<p>I venerated my brother, Ratnaśikhin,</p>
<p>With a donation of lamps.</p>
<p>“I was the servant of Kṣemaṃkara</p>
<p>For the three months of summer sixty times.</p>
<p>After his nirvāṇa, I offered</p>
<p>All my treasure to his stūpa.</p>
<p>“When I was the head of a guild,</p>

<p>M. The Insult by the Brahmin Girl Cañcā</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in the Jetavana, in the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. He was treated with honor, looked up to . . . . At that time, many wandering mendicants belonging to a different faith sat together in a meeting hall and talked with each other: “Sirs, please understand that once we were treated with honor, looked up to, and esteemed by kings, ministers, brahmins, householders, citizens, provincial dwellers, merchants, the heads of guilds, and caravan leaders. Thus, the requisites were obtained for us, too, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding, and medicines for the sick. Now, however, they treat with honor, look up to, esteem, and venerate the śramaṇa Gautama who has appeared in the world, and the requisites are obtained only for him, namely . . . medicines for the sick. Because of this, our gain and honor have now been completely lost. What should we do about this?”</p>
<p>Then someone suggested,  “Sexual intercourse is a fault for those who lead the pure life. So, let us lay this fault on him.”</p>
<p>“How should we do that?” asked another.</p>
<p>They then decided, “We should entice a female mendicant among us who is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold: ‘Sister, now slander the śramaṇa Gautama.’ ”</p>
<p>“Which female mendicant among us is well proportioned, attractive, and pleasant to behold?”</p>
<p>“The brahmin girl Cañcā is. Let us entice her.”</p>
<p>They summoned her by messenger and said, “Sister, understand that once we were treated with honor . . . . The requisites were obtained for us, namely, . . . medicines for the sick. However, since the śramaṇa Gautama appeared in the world, people treat him with honor, and our gain and honor have now been completely lost. Are you going to ignore this?”</p>
<p>“Noble ones, what should I do about that?” asked the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā.</p>
<p>“Sister, can you slander the śramaṇa Gautama for the sake of your relatives, saying, ‘He had sexual intercourse with me’? If you do this, our gain and honor will be restored.”</p>
<p>Having heard this proposal, the brahmin girl Cañcā answered the many wandering mendicants belonging to a different faith: “Noble ones, I would not like to slander the śramaṇa Gautama.”</p>
<p>“Sister, unless you slander the śramaṇa Gautama, you may not have any conversation with us, speak in a friendly manner with us, meet us, or see us. We will not let you stay anywhere. It is possible that you will die from grief over this and be reborn in various hells.”</p>
<p>(Women have little wisdom.)</p>
<p>Thus she became afraid and said, “Noble ones, I will do so.”</p>
<p>“Sister, for now pay frequent visits to the Jetavana,  and then slander the śramaṇa Gautama sometime later.”</p>
<p>She visited the Jetavana after waking up every morning. Later, she tied a vessel to her belly and went to the Blessed One. At that time, the Blessed One was preaching the Dharma in front of an audience of hundreds. When the Blessed One saw the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā, from a distance, he thought, “The actions were performed and accumulated by me, accruing a heap of karma. The conditions have ripened, and they approach me like a flood, inevitably. Who else but me would experience the actions that will certainly appear?”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin girl, the female mendicant Cañcā, sat down in front of the Blessed One and said:</p>
<p>“Having made me pregnant here,</p>
<p>Having been attached and enjoyed yourself,</p>
<p>Are you now preaching the Dharma</p>
<p>With sweet, articulate words?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said,</p>
<p>“One who tells a lie goes to hell.”</p>
<p>The brahmin girl Cañcā replied,</p>
<p>“So does one who claims ‘I did not’ after he did.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One countered:</p>
<p>“Both of them, who are naturally inferior,</p>
<p>Will go to the next life in the same way.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, “Alas, this brahmin girl Cañcā has been planning to harm the Blessed One and the community of monks for a long time!” He caused the vessel to fall on the ground through his magical power. Then the brahmin girl Cañcā was ashamed and quickly went away.</p>
<p>XI. Anavatapta</p>
<p>A. The Buddha’s Visit to Lake Anavatapta</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders said to the Blessed One, “Honored One, the discourse concerned with the Dharma was given to King Prasenajit of Kosala. Where you formed the resolve toward supreme and complete awakening for the first time and how many completely awakened ones  the Blessed One served were also explained. Thus, we will go to the great lake Anavatapta and, in the presence of the Blessed One, explain the karmic bond of each of us.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the monks who were the most venerable of the elders by remaining silent.</p>
<p>It is natural that the buddhas, the blessed ones, without fail perform ten acts while alive. What are the ten? (1) To predict a future buddha; (2) to cause some beings to make the resolution to attain complete and supreme awakening without regressing; (3) to convert all those who are to be converted by that buddha; (4) to indicate the best two of their disciples; (5) to establish the boundary of the community; (6) to abandon one fifth of their life; (7) to display a great miracle in Śrāvastī; (8) to show themselves descending from among the gods in the city of Sāṃkāśya; (9) to establish their parents in the truths; (10) and to show the former karmic bonds together with the community of disciples on the great lake Anavatapta. The buddhas, the blessed ones, do not become completely emancipated until they have performed these acts. In this case, the Blessed One wished to explain the former karmic bonds together with the community of disciples on the great lake Anavatapta. He said to the monks, “Monks, let us go to the great lake Anavatapta and explain the former karmic bonds there.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the monks to the Blessed One. Thereupon the Blessed One, together with four hundred ninety-nine arhats, disappeared from Śrāvastī and went to the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>The place where fierce, dreadful yakṣas dwell</p>
<p>Is pleasant, illuminated by various flowering trees.</p>
<p>From there, these four great rivers coursing toward the oceans</p>
<p>Flow down in the four directions:</p>
<p>The Ganges, Indus, Vakṣu,</p>
<p>And Sītā. There</p>
<p>People do not go, except those who have attained magical power.</p>
<p>The Muni stayed there together with the community.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, living creatures, including those as small as ants, understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. The nāga kings Nanda and Upananda therefore wondered, “Why did the Blessed One entertain mundane thoughts?” They then saw that the Blessed One intended to explain the former karmic bonds on the great lake Anavatapta. And so, in the middle of the great lake Anavatapta they created a lotus blossom with a thousand petals, which was as large as the wheel of a chariot, beautiful, and made entirely of gold, and whose stalk was made of jewels, whose filaments were made of diamonds, and which was surrounded by thousands of other lotus blossoms. The Blessed One sat in the center of the lotus blossom before the community of monks. The monks who were the most venerable of the elders also sat in the centers of the other lotus blossoms.</p>
<p>B. The Contest of Magical Power between Śāriputra and Mahā­maudgalyāyana</p>
<p>1. A Story of the Present</p>
<p>At that time, the venerable Śāriputra was sewing his outer robe on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “Maudgalyāyana, go and bring your going-forth companion.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One.” The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana then disappeared from the great lake Anavatapta and instantly stood in front of the venerable Śāriputra on Gṛdhrakūṭa. He said, “O Venerable Śāriputra, the Teacher is waiting for you, intending to explain the former karmic bonds together with four hundred ninety-nine arhats on The great lake Anavatapta. Let us go there.”</p>
<p>“O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana,” replied Śāriputra, “for the time being, I will sew my outer robe. After that, I will go.”</p>
<p>“I will help you,” said Mahā­maudgalyāyana.</p>
<p>“Please do so.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana began to sew, using the five fingers of each hand with his magical power. The venerable Śāriputra said,  “O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, now then, let’s finish sewing.”</p>
<p>“O Venerable Śāriputra,” replied Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “if you do not go on your own, I will take you by force.”</p>
<p>The venerable Śāriputra then took off his belt and said, “O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, since you have been praised by the Blessed One as the best of those who possess magical power, you should take this first and take me afterward.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it. The venerable Śāriputra thought, “Since he possesses great dignity and great magical power, it is possible that he will take it.” He then tied it around the summit of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. When the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it again, Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa quaked. The venerable Śāriputra thought, “He might take even Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa. I will now tie it around Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains.” He then did tie it around Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains. Again, when the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana pulled it, Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, quaked, as did the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda. The entire Anavatapta also trembled, and the monks who were the most venerable of the elders shook, too. Sitting in the centers of the lotus blossoms, they asked the Blessed One, “O Honored One, why are the two nāga kings Nanda and Upananda quaking?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “Nanda and Upananda are not quaking by themselves, but because the two great disciples are displaying their magical power.”</p>
<p>The venerable Śāriputra thought, “Since even this Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, might be taken, I will now tie the belt around the stalk of the lotus on which the Blessed One is sitting.” He then did tie it around the stalk of the lotus on which the Blessed One was sitting, and it remained unmoving. When his magical power was hindered thus by the other’s magical power, Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the venerable Śāriputra, “O Venerable Śāriputra, you have finished playing with your magical power.  Now, please come.”</p>
<p>“O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, you go and I will come after.”</p>
<p>Yet, before the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana arrived, the venerable Śāriputra himself arrived. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat in the center of a lotus blossom. Then the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana arrived. When he saw the venerable Śāriputra, he said, “O Venerable Śāriputra, have you already come?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have, O Venerable One.”</p>
<p>2. A Story of the Past: The Painter and the Mechanic</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that, although the Blessed One has praised the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana as the best of those who possess magical power, the venerable Śāriputra defeated him with his magical power?”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks,” the Blessed One replied, “how, not only in the present but also in the past, he defeated him with his art.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there was a certain painter in the midland region. He went on some business from the midland region to a region called Yavana. There he entered the house of a mechanic. The mechanic made a mechanical woman to attend on the fatigued painter and gave it to him. It washed his feet and stayed with him. Then he said ‘Leave,’ but it remained silent. He thought, ‘Certainly she must have been given to me so that she and I would enjoy ourselves.’ He took it by the hand and pulled it, whereupon it broke into a pile of wooden pieces. He felt ashamed and thought, ‘I was humiliated here by myself. I will now humiliate him among the king and his attendants.’</p>
<p>“He then painted an image of himself hanged on the surface of the door and hid behind the door. When the time for him to wake up had passed, the mechanic remarked,  ‘It is quite late. Why does he not come out the door?’ He went there and saw the man hanged and dead. He wondered, ‘Why did he kill himself?’ He then saw the mechanical doll broken into a pile of wooden pieces, and thought, ‘He must have hanged himself because he felt ashamed of himself.’</p>
<p>“In the region of Yavana, when a guest died in any house, they would not hold his funeral until they had reported it to the king. Therefore, the mechanic went to the king and reported to him, ‘Your Majesty, a painter came from the midland region and stayed in my dwelling. I made a mechanical woman to attend on him and gave it to him. He took it by the hand and pulled it, whereupon it fell into a pile of wooden pieces. Ashamed, he hanged himself. Your Majesty, I request an inspection of this, and I will hold his funeral afterward.’</p>
<p>“The king then ordered his men, ‘Sirs, go and conduct the inspection.’</p>
<p>“They went and saw the dead body. They asked themselves, ‘In which way should we lift the body down from the hook?’ Some of them said, ‘Cut the hanging rope.’</p>
<p>“When they had brought axes and began to cut the rope, they realized that it was the wall, and so the mechanic felt ashamed. When he thus felt ashamed, the painter came out from behind the door and said, ‘O sir, you humiliated me here by myself, but you have now been humiliated among the king and his attendants.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The painter at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Śāriputra. The mechanic at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana. At that time, he (Śāriputra) defeated him (Maudgalyāyana) with his art. Now again, he has defeated him with his magical power.”</p>
<p>3. A Story of the Past: The Two Painters</p>
<p>“Listen, again, to how he defeated him with his art.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there were two painters in a certain hamlet,  who fell into a quarrel with one another. One said, ‘I know art well.’</p>
<p>“The other said, ‘I know it much better than you.’</p>
<p>“Competing with each other, they went to the king and threw themselves at the king’s feet. One said, ‘Your Majesty, I know art well.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ the other retorted, ‘I know it much better than him.’</p>
<p>“The king showed them the gateway building and said, ‘I do not know which of you two is more skilled. One of you should paint on one wall, and the other on another, and then I will clearly realize which of you two knows art better.’</p>
<p>“A curtain was put up between the two men as a partition, and they undertook to paint. One of them finished his painting in six months. The other just polished the wall for six months. The one who had finished his painting went to the king and said, ‘Your Majesty, my painting is finished. Please examine it.’</p>
<p>“Then the king with some ministers went out the door and looked at the painting. ‘What a skillful painter!’ he exclaimed, much delighted.</p>
<p>“The other one also threw himself at the king’s feet and said, ‘Now, please look at my painting.’</p>
<p>“He opened the curtain. The king saw reflections appearing there. ‘This one is much more skilled in painting,’ he said, with great astonishment.</p>
<p>“Then the painter closed the curtain again, threw himself at the king’s feet, and said, ‘Your Majesty, this is not a painting but a polished wall.’</p>
<p>“Then the king declared with further astonishment, ‘This one is much more skilled in art.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who just polished the wall for six months was indeed this monk Śāriputra. The one who painted for six months at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana.  At that time, he (Śāriputra) defeated him (Maudgalyāyana) with his art. Now again, he has defeated him with his magical power.”</p>
<p>4. A Story of the Past: The Ṛṣis Śaṅkha and Likhita (1)</p>
<p>“Listen, again, to how he defeated him.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there lived two ṛṣis named Śaṅkha and Likhita near the city of Vārāṇasī. One day, a god brought rain and the ground became muddy. Śaṅkha slipped and fell in the mud, and his water jar broke. He then put a curse on the god: ‘Wicked one, may you not bring rain for twelve years from today onward!’</p>
<p>“Having heard about this, King Brahmadatta and the people dwelling in Vārāṇasī went to him and requested, ‘O great ṛṣi, do not do that.’</p>
<p>“ ‘I cannot forgive the wicked one,’ he replied. ‘Subdued by my curse, he will not bring rain for twelve years.’</p>
<p>“King Brahmadatta and the people then requested help from Likhita. He prayed, and the god brought rain.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The ṛṣi Śaṅkha at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana. The ṛṣi Likhita at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Śāriputra. At that time, too, he defeated him with his magical power.”</p>
<p>5. A Story of the Past: The Ṛṣis Śaṅkha and Likhita (2)</p>
<p>“Listen, again, to how he defeated him with his magical power.</p>
<p>“When Likhita threw himself at Śaṅkha’s feet for some reason, Śaṅkha trod on the locks of his hair. Likhita cursed him: ‘May your head split when the sun rises!’</p>
<p>“Śaṅkha retorted, ‘If so, may the sun not rise!’</p>
<p>“The world was then covered in darkness. Thus, the king, brahmins, and householders requested Śaṅkha, ‘O great ṛṣi, please do not do this.’</p>
<p>“He replied, ‘If the sun rises, my head will certainly split.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If that’s the case,  make a head out of clay,’ said Likhita.</p>
<p>“When a replica of Śaṅkha’s head had been made out of clay, the sun rose, and the head split.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? Śaṅkha was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana. Likhita was indeed this monk Śāriputra. At that time, too, he defeated him.”</p>
<p>6. A Story of the Past: The Ivory Carver and the Painter</p>
<p>“Listen, again, to how he defeated him.</p>
<p>“A certain ivory carver went from the midland region to the region of Yavana, bringing one prastha of ivory rice grains. He entered the house of a painter, but the painter was away. He said to the painter’s wife, ‘Wife of my friend, please cook this prastha of rice and give it.’ He put the rice grains there and left.</p>
<p>“She then set them to cook, but they were still not done even after all the firewood was exhausted. When her husband came back home, he asked her, ‘Good lady, what is this?’</p>
<p>“She explained everything in detail. He examined the rice grains and realized that they were made of ivory. He scolded his wife and said, ‘Good lady, this is salty water. Bring some different, better water and this rice will get done with that.’</p>
<p>“She asked the ivory carver, ‘Please bring some better water.’</p>
<p>“The painter, having thus instructed her, painted a pond in a certain place and also painted a dead dog there. Then the ivory carver brought a water jar. Believing that it was a pond, he arrived at that place and saw the dead dog. When he began to examine it, covering his nose, his water jar fell and broke. The ivory carver felt ashamed.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The ivory carver at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana. The painter at that time, on that occasion, was indeed this monk Śāriputra. However, self-awakened ones do not know even the names of the dhyāna, samādhi, and samāpatti that the Tathāgata has attained. The monk Śāriputra does not know even the names of what self-awakened ones have attained.  The monk Maudgalyāyana does not know even the names of what the monk Śāriputra has attained. Other disciples do not know even the names of what the monk Maudgalyāyana has attained. Although the monk Śāriputra possesses greater magical power and greater dignity than the monk Maudgalyāyana, I praised Maudgalyāyana as the best of those who possess magical power, implying that he has exercised it many times.”</p>
<p>Here ends the Section of Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana.</p>
<p>C. Verses of the Elders I</p>
<p>1. Kāśyapa</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Mahākāśyapa explained his karmic bond. The following was spoken:</p>
<p>When he went there and spoke words</p>
<p>That were suited to what he had done in the past,</p>
<p>Having quickly remembered the small acts</p>
<p>Because of which he enjoyed great fruits,</p>
<p>Just as a lion dwelling in a mountain cave</p>
<p>Walks around his territory without fear,</p>
<p>The incomparable disciple Kāśyapa</p>
<p>Related what he had done in his past lives:</p>
<p>“Believing that the supreme Dharma lay</p>
<p>In an untainted one who was free from turbidity, whose mind was completely liberated,</p>
<p>Who dwelled without defilements, whose mind was free from faults,</p>
<p>I made a wish in my heart regarding his Dharma.</p>
<p>“Since I had given one prastha of millet in alms</p>
<p>To the Self-Awakened One</p>
<p>And wished that I would meet his equal,</p>
<p>I was reborn on the continent of Kuru.</p>
<p>“Through the fruit of that mere act,</p>
<p>Having a body, not attached to things as ‘mine,’ endowed with long life,</p>
<p>Being eminent and of superior deeds,</p>
<p>I was reborn in Kuru a thousand times.</p>
<p>“Through the fruit of that mere act,</p>
<p>I was reborn among the Thirty-Three Gods a thousand times,</p>
<p>Possessed of garlands of flowers, accessories, various perfumes,</p>
<p>Great power, and beautiful bodies.</p>
<p>“Having died there, I was born in Kuru,</p>
<p>And then again enjoyed myself among the good gods.</p>
<p>By the power of a mental aspiration,</p>
<p>I was then born again among good humans.</p>
<p>“Through the fruit of that mere act,</p>
<p>I was born into a very wealthy brahmin family.</p>
<p>Born rich, attended by men and women,</p>
<p>Still I did not seek the five objects of desire.</p>
<p>“Not having met the Teacher</p>
<p>Nor the incomparable disciples,</p>
<p>I bowed respectfully to arhats in patched robes,</p>
<p>Who were venerated in the world, and went forth.</p>
<p>“When I had thus gone forth,</p>
<p>I saw the Victor sitting in the Bahuputra shrine.</p>
<p>I bowed to the Muni’s feet and said,</p>
<p>‘O Blessed One, my teacher, I am your disciple.’</p>
<p>“He said, ‘Kāśyapa, as you said,</p>
<p>I am your teacher, and you are my disciple.</p>
<p>If you desire to be liberated from all suffering,</p>
<p>You should listen to the sweet Dharma, which is sweetly taught.’</p>
<p>“The best of humans, the Protector,</p>
<p>The one who possesses great compassion, taught me the Dharma</p>
<p>Concerning the four dhyānas, the powers, the faculties,</p>
<p>The limbs of awakening, the limbs of the path, and liberation.</p>
<p>“I succeeded in meditating on them with joy.</p>
<p>I have exhausted impurity and bear my final body.</p>
<p>I met these straightforward ones,</p>
<p>Who bear their final bodies and are taintless.</p>
<p>“The Tathāgata, the Victor, speaks what is perfect.</p>
<p>The wish of those who keep to good conduct will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Everything I thought in my mind</p>
<p>Was fulfilled. This is the end of my existence.</p>
<p>“My births have been exhausted. The bonds</p>
<p>And thirst that had risen from everywhere were destroyed.</p>
<p>I am a son born from the heart of the Dharma King.</p>
<p>I will be completely emancipated because my mass of defilements is exhausted.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who practice austerities.</p>
<p>Being untainted and free from faults,</p>
<p>I attained the immovable state.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Kāśyapa</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the first section: The Section of Kāśyapa.</p>
<p>2. Śāriputra</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders asked the venerable Śāriputra, “What karma did the venerable Śāriputra create that matured to cause his great wisdom and great eloquence?” He said:</p>
<p>“In the wilderness, I saw a self-awakened one—</p>
<p>A ṛṣi, a śramaṇa,</p>
<p>A tranquil one, a fortunate one—</p>
<p>Wearing at that time a worn-out robe.</p>
<p>“My mind filled with faith in him,</p>
<p>I washed, sewed,</p>
<p>And dyed his robe.</p>
<p>Thus, I frequently approached him.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, out of compassion for me,</p>
<p>He soared up into the sky.</p>
<p>Blazing with his own radiance,</p>
<p>He flew through the air.</p>
<p>“Making the gesture of supplication,</p>
<p>I formed an aspiration:</p>
<p>‘May I possess</p>
<p>Such keen faculties and great wisdom!</p>
<p>“ ‘May I be born neither into a wealthy family</p>
<p>Nor among lowly ones</p>
<p>But into a middle-rank family</p>
<p>And go forth again and again!’</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>Throughout five hundred lives</p>
<p>I attained a human birth</p>
<p>And went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>“I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>“I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>O honored ones, I succeeded in reaching</p>
<p>The end of existence in half a month.</p>
<p>“Sitting before the community of monks,</p>
<p>The Teacher praised me</p>
<p>As the turner of the wheel of the Dharma,</p>
<p>The best of those who possess wisdom.”</p>
<p>Thus Śāriputra, who is of great wisdom,</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the second section: The Section of Śāriputra.</p>
<p>3. Maudgalyāyana</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, “O Venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, the venerable Śāriputra has explained his karmic bond. Now you, too, should explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Thus requested, the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana said to the monks who were the most venerable of the elders:</p>
<p>“When I was once a ṛṣi</p>
<p>Living in a forest,</p>
<p>A man came there</p>
<p>And asked me to let him go forth.</p>
<p>“I shaved his hair,</p>
<p>Washed and dyed his robe,</p>
<p>And gave it to him.</p>
<p>Then he was pleased.</p>
<p>“Having gone to one side,</p>
<p>He sat down with his legs crossed</p>
<p>And attained the state of a self-awakened one.</p>
<p>Thereupon he flew away through the air.</p>
<p>“Having acquired faith,</p>
<p>I respectfully made the gesture of supplication.</p>
<p>Requesting the best magical power,</p>
<p>Right there I made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘May my magical power</p>
<p>Be equal to this great ṛṣi’s!’</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I dwelt among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who possess magical power.</p>
<p>By doing a little good,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>“I will also explain</p>
<p>My unwholesome karma; listen to it.</p>
<p>In the most excellent city of Rājagṛha,</p>
<p>I was a son of the head of a guild.</p>
<p>“When I came home for a meal</p>
<p>After playing outside the house,</p>
<p>I saw my parents there</p>
<p>Hiding in a hidden place.</p>
<p>“Having been seen, they hit me</p>
<p>And scolded me out of shame.</p>
<p>I committed a sin of the mind</p>
<p>Against my two parents, thinking,</p>
<p>‘When I grow bigger,</p>
<p>I will kill them as if cutting reeds!’</p>
<p>“Although it was my mind,</p>
<p>Not my body, that committed the sin,</p>
<p>I experienced unbearable pain</p>
<p>In the Black Cord Hell.</p>
<p>“Because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>In this final existence of mine</p>
<p>Śramaṇas belonging to a different faith</p>
<p>Will kill me as if cutting a reed.</p>
<p>“I will die from that very pain.</p>
<p>After that,</p>
<p>The remainder of my actions</p>
<p>Will come to an end.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you should make your mind</p>
<p>Pure toward your parents.</p>
<p>By means of a pure mind,</p>
<p>Beings go to superior modes of existence.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Kolita</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the third section: The Section of Kolita.</p>
<p>4. Śobhita</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Śobhita, “O Venerable Śobhita, the venerable Kolita has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Śobhita, should explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Śobhita did explain his karmic bond in the presence of the community of monks:</p>
<p>“When I went to the community’s park,</p>
<p>Having seen a heap of dust in the garden,</p>
<p>I took a broom</p>
<p>And then, with pleasure, cleaned the place.</p>
<p>“Thereupon with my mind filled with faith,</p>
<p>Seeing the garden cleaned, I said,</p>
<p>‘Just as this garden is clean,</p>
<p>May my defilements vanish!’</p>
<p>“By that root of merit,</p>
<p>Wherever I was reborn</p>
<p>I was well proportioned,</p>
<p>Pleasant to behold, and attractive.</p>
<p>“Because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>In my final body,</p>
<p>I was named Śobhita, ‘Beautiful One,’</p>
<p>By my two parents.</p>
<p>“I was born beautiful.</p>
<p>Whenever I was in my relatives’ presence,</p>
<p>I was liked, loved, and worshiped</p>
<p>By all the relatives.</p>
<p>“I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The aspiration I made—‘May my defilements vanish!’—</p>
<p>Was fulfilled.</p>
<p>What is to be done has been done, and there are no more defilements.</p>
<p>I am an untainted arhat.</p>
<p>“Superior to one who cleans</p>
<p>The entire continent of Jambu with cloth from Kāśi</p>
<p>Is one who, free from desire,</p>
<p>Cleans the path for a ṛṣi’s walking.</p>
<p>“Superior to one who cleans</p>
<p>The walking paths of ṛṣis’ all over the continent of Jambu</p>
<p>Is one who cleans land as small as a mat</p>
<p>Belonging to the community of the four directions.</p>
<p>“Superior to one who cleans</p>
<p>The parks of the community all over the continent of Jambu</p>
<p>Is one who cleans a part of the stūpa of the Victor</p>
<p>That is as small as the palm of a hand.</p>
<p>“Having realized these differences</p>
<p>That I have realized,</p>
<p>You should clean the Sugata’s stūpa</p>
<p>And make your minds filled with faith.</p>
<p>“After that, those who know the many good qualities</p>
<p>Of the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>Should venerate the stūpas.</p>
<p>They will gain great fruits.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the good deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>I have experienced its desirable,</p>
<p>Lovable, pleasant fruit.</p>
<p>“Therefore, one should perform excellent veneration</p>
<p>Of the stūpa of the Victor.</p>
<p>O honored ones, this is</p>
<p>The best, the supreme field of merit.</p>
<p>“The offerings by those whose minds are filled with faith</p>
<p>In the Completely Awakened One, the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>Or the disciples of the buddhas</p>
<p>Will not be small.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Śobhita</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the fourth section: The Section of Śobhita.</p>
<p>5. Sumanas</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Sumanas, “O Venerable Sumanas, the venerable Śobhita has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Sumanas, should explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>“Wearing a nutmeg (sumanas) flower as an earring,</p>
<p>With a garland of flowers bound around my head,</p>
<p>I went to a park,</p>
<p>Surrounded by friends.</p>
<p>“I saw many people there,</p>
<p>From every direction,</p>
<p>Respectfully venerating the stūpa</p>
<p>Of the great Muni Vipaśyin.</p>
<p>“Then I instructed my friends</p>
<p>To set on the stūpa</p>
<p>Every one of their garlands,</p>
<p>With their minds made pure.</p>
<p>“Having seen them do so there,</p>
<p>Along with many others,</p>
<p>I removed the nutmeg flower from my ear</p>
<p>And then set it on the stūpa.</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>Wherever I was reborn,</p>
<p>Having made such merit,</p>
<p>I dwelt among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Since I had offered one flower,</p>
<p>I enjoyed divine lives</p>
<p>For a thousand years</p>
<p>And was emancipated through the remains of that karma.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, if one knows</p>
<p>The many good qualities of the Buddha,</p>
<p>One will perform veneration again and again</p>
<p>With perfectly pure thoughts.</p>
<p>“Thus, those who know the many good qualities</p>
<p>Of the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>Should serve stūpas.</p>
<p>They will gain great fruits.</p>
<p>“The result of the offerings by those whose minds are filled with faith</p>
<p>In the Completely Awakened One, the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>Or the disciples of buddhas</p>
<p>Will not be insignificant.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the good deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>I experienced its desirable,</p>
<p>Lovable, pleasant fruit.</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>Having exhausted my rebirths,</p>
<p>Destroyed defilements, and become peaceful,</p>
<p>I am an arhat, emancipated.</p>
<p>“In the ‘beds of rebirth’ in transmigration</p>
<p>I will never lie again.</p>
<p>This is my final existence;</p>
<p>I will never experience another.</p>
<p>“For this reason</p>
<p>I was given this name, Sumanas.</p>
<p>I was liberated from all suffering</p>
<p>And crossed the ocean of existence.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Sumanas</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the fifth section: The Section of Sumanas.</p>
<p>6. Koṭīviṃśa</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Koṭīviṃśa, “O Venerable Koṭīviṃśa, the venerable Sumanas has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond. What karma did you, Venerable Koṭīviṃśa, create that caused you to be praised by the Blessed One as the best of those who exert themselves?” He said:</p>
<p>“In the royal capital Bandhumatī,</p>
<p>In the time of Vipaśyin’s teachings,</p>
<p>I built a dwelling place</p>
<p>For the community of the four directions.</p>
<p>“I covered the floor</p>
<p>Of the dwelling place with cloths.</p>
<p>Pleased and satisfied,</p>
<p>I then made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘May I, after having pleased the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>And having succeeded in being ordained,</p>
<p>Attain nirvāṇa, the supreme tranquility,</p>
<p>The ageless state.’</p>
<p>“By this merit,</p>
<p>Having made such merit,</p>
<p>For ninety eons</p>
<p>I transmigrated among the gods and humans.</p>
<p>“After that, because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>I was born in my final body</p>
<p>In Campā, as the sole son</p>
<p>Of the best of the heads of the guilds.</p>
<p>“As soon as I was born,</p>
<p>My father was pleased to hear it and said,</p>
<p>‘I will give my property,</p>
<p>Which is worth two hundred million (koṭī­dravyasya viṃśatiṃ), to my son!’</p>
<p>“The hair on the soles of my feet</p>
<p>Was very fine, smooth,</p>
<p>Pleasant to touch, and soft as wool,</p>
<p>And it grew as long as the breadth of four fingers.</p>
<p>“During the past ninety eons</p>
<p>And this eon,</p>
<p>I did not experience putting my feet on the ground</p>
<p>Without a carpet covering it.</p>
<p>“I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who exert themselves.</p>
<p>Being untainted and free from faults,</p>
<p>I attained the immovable state.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Koṭīviṃśa</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the sixth section: The Section of Koṭīviṃśa.</p>
<p>7. Vāgīśa</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Vāgīśa, “O Venerable Vāgīśa, the venerable Koṭīviṃśa has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond.” He said:</p>
<p>“During the past ninety eons,</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans</p>
<p>And never knew inferior modes of existence.</p>
<p>“I performed veneration</p>
<p>When I saw Vipaśyin’s stūpa,</p>
<p>Not knowing it was good,</p>
<p>But only because I saw it.</p>
<p>“I bought incense, a garland of flowers, and perfume</p>
<p>With sixty kaparda</p>
<p>And put them on the stūpa.</p>
<p>Because of this, I never descended into inferior states of existence.</p>
<p>“By doing a little good,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“If I had served the stūpa</p>
<p>In the knowledge of</p>
<p>The Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>I would have done even more good.</p>
<p>“Thus, those who know the many good qualities</p>
<p>Of the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>Should serve stūpas.</p>
<p>They will gain great fruits.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who have heard much,</p>
<p>The best narrator (vāgīśa),</p>
<p>The verse-composer endowed with excellent eloquence.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Vāgīśa</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the seventh section: The Section of Vāgīśa.</p>
<p>8. Piṇḍola</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Piṇḍola­bharadvāja, “O Venerable Piṇḍola­bharadvāja, the venerable Vāgīśa has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Piṇḍola­bharadvāja said:</p>
<p>“When, as a son of the head of a guild,</p>
<p>I was managing my father’s house,</p>
<p>I obeyed my father’s wishes</p>
<p>But behaved falsely toward my mother.</p>
<p>“Although I satisfied my father, sisters, brothers,</p>
<p>Slaves, and workmen</p>
<p>With food and drink,</p>
<p>I abused my mother.</p>
<p>“Ruled by avarice,</p>
<p>I did not give food to my mother</p>
<p>But uttered these words with anger:</p>
<p>‘Eat stones for food!’</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I descended many times into the hells</p>
<p>Called Intense Heat and Black Cord</p>
<p>And suffered great pain.</p>
<p>“When I died in hell</p>
<p>And attained human life,</p>
<p>Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I had to eat stones.</p>
<p>“In each life,</p>
<p>I had to eat many stones</p>
<p>And died,</p>
<p>Suffering from hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who roar a lion’s roar.</p>
<p>I have abandoned all defilements;</p>
<p>I am untainted, for I am free from defilements.</p>
<p>“Still, O honored ones,</p>
<p>Even though I have attained such magical power,</p>
<p>Dwelling in a cave, my food</p>
<p>Will be nothing but stones.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is</p>
<p>The sin I remember committing.</p>
<p>Its fruit is experienced,</p>
<p>For actions never vanish.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Piṇḍola­bharadvāja</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the eighth section: The Section of Piṇḍola­bharadvāja.</p>
<p>9. Svāgata</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Svāgata, “O Venerable Svāgata, the venerable Piṇḍola­bharadvāja has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Svāgata, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Svāgata did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In the royal capital Bandhumatī,</p>
<p>I was the son of a merchant.</p>
<p>Possessed of great wealth and much grain,</p>
<p>I was honored by the people.</p>
<p>“Respected by the king, citizens,</p>
<p>And ministers,</p>
<p>I was pleasant to behold, attractive,</p>
<p>And full of beauty in my youth.</p>
<p>“Then, in a carriage,</p>
<p>I went to a park,</p>
<p>Accompanied by others,</p>
<p>Possessing every object of desire.</p>
<p>“In the park, I saw</p>
<p>A śramaṇa in a worn-out robe</p>
<p>Who had trained his faculties</p>
<p>And behaved with his faculties pacified.</p>
<p>“When I saw that śramaṇa,</p>
<p>I became dejected.</p>
<p>Although he had no fault, I disliked,</p>
<p>Reproached, and reviled him:</p>
<p>“ ‘Whose disciple is this mendicant,</p>
<p>Who has an ill-colored face and dreadful appearance,</p>
<p>Who is leprous, with his body full of wounds, and skinny,</p>
<p>His veins popping out?’</p>
<p>“Because of such verbal misconduct</p>
<p>And the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>After dying there,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells.</p>
<p>“After dying in hell,</p>
<p>I was born into suffering, with an ill-colored face.</p>
<p>I was leprous, my body full of wounds,</p>
<p>And was skinny, my veins popping out.</p>
<p>“I walked with a bowl in my hand,</p>
<p>In a hempen garment.</p>
<p>I lay on dust heaps,</p>
<p>Homeless, helpless, without any protector.</p>
<p>“When I begged for food,</p>
<p>Wherever I went,</p>
<p>I was turned away with a stick.</p>
<p>Everyone reproached me.</p>
<p>“Thus, for five hundred lives,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I died</p>
<p>After suffering from hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>“Every living being called me</p>
<p>Durāgata, ‘Badly Come,’ slandering me.</p>
<p>Because everyone considered me unpleasant,</p>
<p>I was subject to slander.</p>
<p>“I saw the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>Teach the supreme state</p>
<p>To many people</p>
<p>Before the community of monks.</p>
<p>“When I saw the mass of people,</p>
<p>Expecting I would obtain</p>
<p>As much food and drink as I wanted,</p>
<p>I quickly ran there. But when I arrived,</p>
<p>“I saw those people</p>
<p>Were sitting for the Dharma.</p>
<p>Disappointed, I turned away,</p>
<p>Thinking that none would give me food.</p>
<p>“Then the compassionate Muni,</p>
<p>The Protector, spoke to me:</p>
<p>‘Svāgata (Welcome)! Are you well?</p>
<p>You should sit down on this seat!’</p>
<p>“This made me joyful,</p>
<p>And I respectfully made the gesture of supplication.</p>
<p>Thereupon, having paid homage at the Teacher’s feet,</p>
<p>I sat down to one side.</p>
<p>“Then the compassionate Teacher,</p>
<p>Gautama, gave a gradual sermon</p>
<p>Out of compassion,</p>
<p>And I saw the truths.</p>
<p>“Having seen the truths, I asked the great Muni</p>
<p>For permission to go forth.</p>
<p>Gautama, who possesses great compassion,</p>
<p>Out of mercy let me go forth.</p>
<p>“The leader of the world</p>
<p>Named me Svāgata.</p>
<p>He praises me as the best</p>
<p>Of those who meditate on the fire element.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Svāgata</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the ninth section: The Section of Svāgata.</p>
<p>10. Nandika</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Nandika, “O Venerable Nandika, the venerable Svāgata has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Nandika, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Nandika did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When I was a son of the head of a guild</p>
<p>In the most excellent city Rājagṛha,</p>
<p>A famine broke out there,</p>
<p>And there was a need to feed ṛṣis.</p>
<p>“There arrived</p>
<p>A certain self-awakened one, a fortunate one,</p>
<p>An untainted, peaceful,</p>
<p>Beautiful ṛṣi, to be fed by me.</p>
<p>“Having the fault of avarice in my mind,</p>
<p>I wrongly thought,</p>
<p>‘At the present time, who can feed</p>
<p>This śramaṇa for seven years?’</p>
<p>“Then I boiled rice</p>
<p>In horse urine</p>
<p>And made the ṛṣi eat it;</p>
<p>He then died.</p>
<p>“Since I had created that evil karma,</p>
<p>I myself was boiled for a long time in the hells</p>
<p>Such as Being Crushed, Scream,</p>
<p>Heat, and Intense Heat.</p>
<p>“Even when, having died in hell,</p>
<p>I attained a human life,</p>
<p>I was sick and dependent on others,</p>
<p>And died after suffering.</p>
<p>“Thus, for five hundred lives,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I always died</p>
<p>From unpleasant, fearful illnesses.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, even now,</p>
<p>Possessing magical power and being untainted,</p>
<p>I live in sickness,</p>
<p>Thrashing around with such pain.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Nandika</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>

<p>D. Verses of the Elders II</p>
<p>1. Yaśas (1)</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Yaśas, “O Venerable Yaśas, the venerable Nandika has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Yaśas, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Yaśas did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“I was once a ṛṣi in the wilderness.</p>
<p>When I went to a village for alms,</p>
<p>I saw a woman’s dead body,</p>
<p>Which was blue and swollen.</p>
<p>“I sat with my legs crossed</p>
<p>And properly observed it.</p>
<p>I attentively practiced</p>
<p>Meditation on impurity.</p>
<p>“While I was sitting, its belly burst</p>
<p>And emitted a dreadful sound.</p>
<p>When I heard that,</p>
<p>I arose from my meditation.</p>
<p>“I then saw the contents of its belly—</p>
<p>Vomit, blood,</p>
<p>A rotten smell, and excrement—</p>
<p>Flow out from everywhere.</p>
<p>“The bowels, coiled intestine, kidneys,</p>
<p>Heart, and lungs</p>
<p>Were being eaten by hundreds of worms.</p>
<p>I again concentrated my mind:</p>
<p>“ ‘This is just like that;</p>
<p>That is just like this.’</p>
<p>Having seen another’s dead body,</p>
<p>I concentrated on my own body.</p>
<p>“After that, I arose from that meditation</p>
<p>And went back to the hermitage.</p>
<p>Then I did not walk around for alms,</p>
<p>Or eat or drink.</p>
<p>“When I again entered</p>
<p>The village for food,</p>
<p>I saw an attractive body</p>
<p>And meditated on excrement in regard to it.</p>
<p>“ ‘Its whole appearance is</p>
<p>The same as a dead body.</p>
<p>Its belly, too, is full of excrement,</p>
<p>And everything is to be despised.’</p>
<p>“Having thus meditated again and again,</p>
<p>I achieved freedom from desire.</p>
<p>Since I had practiced well</p>
<p>The four immeasurable pure abodes,</p>
<p>“After dying there,</p>
<p>I was born in the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>After dying in the world of Brahmā,</p>
<p>I was born in the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“Born there as the only son of the best of the heads of the guilds,</p>
<p>I was endowed with glory,</p>
<p>Was lovable, pleasing to everyone,</p>
<p>And perfect, and I attained an exalted position.</p>
<p>“I used to walk around by day</p>
<p>And sleep at night.</p>
<p>When I casually woke up,</p>
<p>I saw many women there,</p>
<p>“Sleeping with clay drums, large drums,</p>
<p>Gongs, and lutes as their pillows,</p>
<p>Naked, talking in their sleep,</p>
<p>With their arms stretched out.</p>
<p>“Then the cause from my past,</p>
<p>Which had great power, arose.</p>
<p>Thereupon the idea of a cemetery and excrement</p>
<p>Regarding women occurred to me.</p>
<p>“Then, disturbed,</p>
<p>I uttered these words out of fear:</p>
<p>‘O friend, I am depressed,</p>
<p>Completely caught in misery!’</p>
<p>“Thereupon I rose from the bed</p>
<p>And descended from the terrace.</p>
<p>Since the gods regarded me with compassion,</p>
<p>The door opened for me.</p>
<p>“I left the city and</p>
<p>Went near the bank of a river.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank, I saw</p>
<p>A śramaṇa with trained faculties.</p>
<p>“At the sight of the śramaṇa,</p>
<p>I called out to him,</p>
<p>‘O śramaṇa, I am depressed,</p>
<p>Completely caught in misery!’</p>
<p>“Then the Teacher</p>
<p>Gave me nectar-like words:</p>
<p>‘Son, do not be afraid. Come!</p>
<p>No one will harm you here.’</p>
<p>“I threw away my jeweled shoes,</p>
<p>Crossed the river,</p>
<p>And went to the Buddha, that matchless man,</p>
<p>Who has great compassion.</p>
<p>“Then, knowing my thirst,</p>
<p>That matchless man, the Teacher,</p>
<p>Preached the sweet Dharma.</p>
<p>I absorbed it.</p>
<p>“Then, having seen the truths,</p>
<p>I asked the great Muni for permission to go forth.</p>
<p>Gautama, who has great compassion,</p>
<p>Let me go forth out of compassion.</p>
<p>“When the night was over,</p>
<p>And the sun rose,</p>
<p>My impurities vanished.</p>
<p>I became tranquil and emancipated.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Yaśas</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the eleventh section: The Section of Yaśas.</p>
<p>2. Śaivala</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Śaivala, “O Venerable Śaivala, the venerable Yaśas has explained his karmic bond. You, Venerable Śaivala, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Śaivala did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In the city of Vārāṇasī,</p>
<p>After the nirvāṇa of the Teacher Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>King Kṛkin built</p>
<p>A large stūpa made of jewels.</p>
<p>“As the eldest son</p>
<p>Of the celebrated King Kṛkin,</p>
<p>I set the first parasol</p>
<p>On the Victor’s stūpa.</p>
<p>“Since I had created that good karma,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I dwelt among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“In each life,</p>
<p>Endowed with enormous property,</p>
<p>Possessed of wealth and grain,</p>
<p>I was a great donor.</p>
<p>“For five hundred lives,</p>
<p>I gave generous donations</p>
<p>And satisfied beggars, śramaṇas,</p>
<p>And brahmins.</p>
<p>“With a very pure mind,</p>
<p>I satisfied five hundred self-awakened ones</p>
<p>Who were free from desire, untainted,</p>
<p>And free from roughness.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>In this final existence,</p>
<p>I was born into a wealthy Śākyan family.</p>
<p>As soon as I was born, I spoke these words:</p>
<p>“ ‘How much wealth and grain</p>
<p>Is there in this house?</p>
<p>I will give this as donations</p>
<p>And satisfy the poor.</p>
<p>“ ‘Giving food to the poor,</p>
<p>I will never tire of giving.</p>
<p>Tell me quickly</p>
<p>How much wealth there is!’</p>
<p>“Having heard my words,</p>
<p>They were frightened</p>
<p>And ran away in all directions,</p>
<p>Except my mother.</p>
<p>“Out of love for her son,</p>
<p>My mother then said to me,</p>
<p>‘A god, a human, or a yakṣa—</p>
<p>Who are you? Tell me quickly!’</p>
<p>“ ‘Mother, I am your son.</p>
<p>I am human, not a rākṣasa.</p>
<p>Remembering my previous life as a donor,</p>
<p>I am always delighted to give donations.’</p>
<p>“When she heard these words of mine,</p>
<p>My mother was pleased</p>
<p>And set me at ease, saying,</p>
<p>‘My only son, make as many donations as you wish.’</p>
<p>“My mother raised me</p>
<p>With abundant necessities.</p>
<p>No one tired of seeing me,</p>
<p>Who was lovable and pleasing to everyone.</p>
<p>“As soon as I was born,</p>
<p>Our wealth, grain,</p>
<p>Gold, slaves, and workmen</p>
<p>Began to increase constantly.</p>
<p>“Since I had been born as an auspicious (śaivala) child,</p>
<p>And spoke as soon as I was born,</p>
<p>My relatives</p>
<p>Named me Śaivala.</p>
<p>“Thereafter, giving donations,</p>
<p>I satisfied the poor.</p>
<p>I pleased the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>And went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“I did not go forth because of worries about livelihood</p>
<p>Or suffering from debt.</p>
<p>At that time, having gone forth out of faith,</p>
<p>I attained the six kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Venerated by the king, ministers,</p>
<p>And citizens,</p>
<p>I obtained food, drink, robes,</p>
<p>And bedding and seats.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Śaivala</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twelfth section: The Section of Śaivala.</p>
<p>3. Bakkula</p>
<p>Thereupon the many monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Bakkula, “O Venerable Bakkula, the venerable Śaivala has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Bakkula, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Bakkula  did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In the royal capital of Bandhumatī,</p>
<p>I was once a perfumer.</p>
<p>In Vipaśyin’s dispensation,</p>
<p>I made an offer to the community of monks:</p>
<p>“ ‘I will give as much medicine</p>
<p>For the sick as you want.</p>
<p>I will satisfy the community</p>
<p>With medicines deriving from bark, roots, and fruits.’</p>
<p>“When I had thus made an offer to the community for the rainy season,</p>
<p>Nothing was asked for,</p>
<p>Except once when a monk asked me</p>
<p>For a fruit of the harītakī.</p>
<p>“I did not descend into any inferior state of existence</p>
<p>For ninety-one eons.</p>
<p>Thus, regard the great power of</p>
<p>The maturation of the karma of giving medicine.</p>
<p>“By doing a little good,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>By giving a fruit of the harītakī,</p>
<p>I enjoyed the heavens for a long time.</p>
<p>“After that, because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>I attained a human life.</p>
<p>When I was undergoing training,</p>
<p>I did not accept the almsfood obtained from all over the land.</p>
<p>“In only three nights,</p>
<p>I realized the threefold knowledge.</p>
<p>I have lived in poverty</p>
<p>And worn a robe of refuse rags.</p>
<p>“I have not associated with</p>
<p>Either lay people or mendicants.</p>
<p>I am over a hundred and</p>
<p>Sixty-one years old,</p>
<p>“Yet, to the present,</p>
<p>I do not remember becoming sick.</p>
<p>O honored ones, I remember</p>
<p>Performing that little good.</p>
<p>I have experienced its pleasant,</p>
<p>Desirable fruit, which causes happiness.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Bakkula</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirteenth section: The Section of Bakkula.</p>
<p>4. Sthavira</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the elder called Venerable Sthavira, “O Venerable Sthavira, the venerable Bakkula has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Sthavira, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable called Sthavira did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once when I was</p>
<p>A shoemaker in another life,</p>
<p>A famine broke out</p>
<p>And I cooked a piece of hide.</p>
<p>“When I was cooking the piece of hide</p>
<p>In order to eat it,</p>
<p>A śramaṇa approached me</p>
<p>For alms.</p>
<p>“With my mind filled with faith in him,</p>
<p>I gave him the stewed piece of hide.</p>
<p>Having had it,</p>
<p>The śramaṇa soared up into the air.</p>
<p>“I acquired faith</p>
<p>And respectfully made the gesture of supplication.</p>
<p>Then I followed him</p>
<p>Wherever he went.</p>
<p>“Having found great pleasure,</p>
<p>I then made an aspiration:</p>
<p>‘May I always be together with</p>
<p>An elder like him!</p>
<p>“ ‘May I attain</p>
<p>The taintless nature</p>
<p>That this monk has attained with his body!’</p>
<p>Thus I made such an aspiration.</p>
<p>“I then offered a donation of food,</p>
<p>Which was poor looking,</p>
<p>Ill smelling,</p>
<p>And bad tasting.</p>
<p>“By doing a little good like that,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“I have attained the most excellent awakening</p>
<p>For which I made an aspiration.</p>
<p>I have now fully attained</p>
<p>Peaceful nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>Thus the great elder called Sthavira,</p>
<p>Who possessed great power,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the fourteenth section: The Section of the Elder named Sthavira.</p>
<p>5. The Three</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested three elders among them, including the venerable Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, “O Venerables,  the elder called Sthavira has explained his karmic bond. Now you, venerables, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then they also explained their karmic bonds:</p>
<p>“When we three were brothers</p>
<p>And all merchants,</p>
<p>We saw Kāśyapa’s stūpa</p>
<p>Broken into pieces.</p>
<p>“We called together all the merchants</p>
<p>And rebuilt it anew.</p>
<p>We brothers together</p>
<p>Had three parasols set there.</p>
<p>“Since we had performed this good deed,</p>
<p>We enjoyed dwelling in heaven for a long time.</p>
<p>When we returned to human life,</p>
<p>We were born into a wealthy family.</p>
<p>“Not having seen the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>We went forth in a different faith.</p>
<p>When we saw the one performing miracles</p>
<p>On the bank of the Nairañjanā,</p>
<p>“We then begged him for permission</p>
<p>To go forth in his presence.</p>
<p>Then, out of compassion,</p>
<p>The merciful one let us go forth.</p>
<p>“We went to Gayāśīrṣa</p>
<p>And heard Gautama’s teachings.</p>
<p>Thereupon, having exerted ourselves,</p>
<p>We attained the supreme nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“Since at that time, serving the Teacher,</p>
<p>We respectfully saluted the stūpa,</p>
<p>We all went forth</p>
<p>And became peaceful and emancipated.”</p>
<p>“The three elders, Uruvilvā-, Nadī-,</p>
<p>And Gayā-Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>Explained their karma</p>
<p>At the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the fifteenth section: The Section of Uruvilvā-, Nadī-, and Gayā-Kāśyapa.</p>
<p>6. Yaśas (2)</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Yaśas, “O Venerable Yaśas, the venerables Uruvilvā-, Nadī-, and Gayā-Kāśyapa have explained their karmic bonds. Now you should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Yaśas did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once when I was a perfumer,</p>
<p>I was skillful in selling perfumes.</p>
<p>Women and girls came to me</p>
<p>To buy them at that time.</p>
<p>“There I saw</p>
<p>A beautiful woman approaching.</p>
<p>Speaking attractive words,</p>
<p>I touched her with thoughts of desire.</p>
<p>“Although I did not sit with her</p>
<p>Or commit unchastity,</p>
<p>I let my hand touch another’s wife</p>
<p>Without self-restraint.</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells.</p>
<p>When I returned again to human life,</p>
<p>My right hand was withered.</p>
<p>“Thus, for five hundred lives,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>My right hand was</p>
<p>Always impaired and withered.</p>
<p>“Having pleased the Buddha,</p>
<p>I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The happy state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the nonvirtuous deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>Its fruit has been experienced,</p>
<p>For actions never vanish.</p>
<p>“Even though now, O honored ones,</p>
<p>I am endowed with magical power,</p>
<p>This right hand</p>
<p>Is not like the left one.</p>
<p>“A man or woman</p>
<p>Who commits adultery</p>
<p>Tastes the sensation of despair</p>
<p>After being reborn in hell.</p>
<p>“One who is wise and intelligent</p>
<p>Should avoid others’ wives</p>
<p>As if they were blazing flames</p>
<p>And be content with his own wife.</p>
<p>“A man who, having seen others’ wives,</p>
<p>Feels desire for them</p>
<p>Will experience much suffering,</p>
<p>Gripped by hellish pains.</p>
<p>“Since I had thus committed a sin,</p>
<p>I experienced its fruit, which was not insignificant,</p>
<p>In other past lives in hell</p>
<p>For a very long time.</p>
<p>“In this final birth,</p>
<p>Having attained the supreme state,</p>
<p>I was liberated from all suffering</p>
<p>And became peaceful and emancipated.</p>
<p>“Therefore, one who wishes for happiness</p>
<p>And does not wish for suffering</p>
<p>Should not approach others’ wives.</p>
<p>If he does not, he will not suffer.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Yaśas</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the sixteenth section: The Section of Yaśas.</p>
<p>7. Jyotiṣka</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Jyotiṣka, “O Venerable Jyotiṣka, the venerable Yaśas has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Jyotiṣka, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Jyotiṣka did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When Vipaśyin was leading the pure life</p>
<p>In the royal capital of Bandhumatī,</p>
<p>I was the wealthy head of a guild</p>
<p>Named Anaṅgana.</p>
<p>“There were six million</p>
<p>Two hundred thousand attendants</p>
<p>To the great Muni, Vipaśyin.</p>
<p>“At that time, King Bandhumat</p>
<p>And I invited the Bull among Men</p>
<p>For three months.</p>
<p>Each of us satisfied him and his group of disciples</p>
<p>With meals, each time better than the other’s.</p>
<p>“I provided the Buddha with meals</p>
<p>For three months. After that, Bandhumat,</p>
<p>For the final day,</p>
<p>Gave him a generous reception,</p>
<p>Providing various kinds of food, and bedding and seats.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the king donated</p>
<p>A cleanly swept park.</p>
<p>Likewise, he gave</p>
<p>Donations to each monk—</p>
<p>“Ten thousand seats</p>
<p>Covered with cloth—and also at that time</p>
<p>Many well-decorated elephants</p>
<p>Covered with golden nets.</p>
<p>“At that time, also, above each monk</p>
<p>A parasol was raised.</p>
<p>Well-decorated women, whose bodies</p>
<p>Were anointed with sandal paste and agaru,</p>
<p>“Were made by him</p>
<p>To attend on each monk too.</p>
<p>The king himself served the Buddha</p>
<p>In such a reception on the final day.</p>
<p>“The king satisfied</p>
<p>The foremost ṛṣi, the Leader.</p>
<p>When I saw his perfect seat,</p>
<p>I thought at that time,</p>
<p>“ ‘Although I have various kinds of food,</p>
<p>I do not have such a seat.</p>
<p>How might I obtain</p>
<p>Such wealth and elephants?’</p>
<p>“The Lord of Gods, the ruler Śakra,</p>
<p>Appeared before me.</p>
<p>Then Śakra said to me,</p>
<p>‘I, who am your friend, will make them.’</p>
<p>“He created a divine,</p>
<p>Beautiful, comfortable park.</p>
<p>He prepared a divine seat</p>
<p>And covered it with divine coverings.</p>
<p>“After that, I invited the Blessed One Vipaśyin,</p>
<p>The best of people, who was worshiped</p>
<p>By people all over the world,</p>
<p>For a meal together with his disciples.</p>
<p>“I had elephants, including Airāvaṇa,</p>
<p>Decorated with divine accessories,</p>
<p>And had parasols raised</p>
<p>Above each monk.</p>
<p>“Thereupon I offered</p>
<p>A divine meal to the Leader.</p>
<p>I also dressed the Muni and his disciples</p>
<p>In divine clothes.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“I did not know any inferior state of existence</p>
<p>For ninety-one eons.</p>
<p>Since I had venerated Vipaśyin, the glorious one,</p>
<p>The great ṛṣi,</p>
<p>“This is my final life.</p>
<p>I was born</p>
<p>Into a fabulously wealthy family</p>
<p>In Rājagṛha, Bimbisāra’s city.</p>
<p>“I was treated with honor</p>
<p>By King Bimbisāra</p>
<p>And was entirely lovable and pleasing</p>
<p>To the ministers and citizens.</p>
<p>“I was always satisfied</p>
<p>With divine objects of desire in this life.</p>
<p>As a human, I enjoyed</p>
<p>Pleasant objects of desire fit for gods.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the best caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Guide,</p>
<p>The great compassionate Muni,</p>
<p>Traveled to Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>“When I heard that the Buddha, the one of great wisdom,</p>
<p>Had arrived in Rājagṛha,</p>
<p>I went to the Blessed One, the Muni,</p>
<p>With my mind pleased.</p>
<p>“Upon seeing the illuminator of the world, the maker of light,</p>
<p>Wielder of the lamp,</p>
<p>I alighted from the vehicle</p>
<p>And went on foot before the Muni.</p>
<p>“Delighted with the great Muni,</p>
<p>I bowed my head at his feet.</p>
<p>Having saluted the most excellent one,</p>
<p>I sat to one side.</p>
<p>“I quickly pleased</p>
<p>The caravan leader, the sun of humans,</p>
<p>Possessed of great power, who had cut Māra’s fetter,</p>
<p>Who was served by beings.</p>
<p>“The best teacher of the world,</p>
<p>Out of compassion,</p>
<p>Taught me the truths of the noble ones.</p>
<p>I then understood them.</p>
<p>“Thereupon I said to the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The one of great mercy,</p>
<p>‘O Hero, I wish to go forth</p>
<p>And be ordained.’</p>
<p>“Then the one who possessed the supreme wisdom,</p>
<p>The Buddha, the matchless man,</p>
<p>Said, ‘Come, monk,’</p>
<p>And I was ordained.</p>
<p>“Thus, being careful,</p>
<p>Exerting myself, practicing steady meditation,</p>
<p>I reached the most excellent state,</p>
<p>The nectar, tranquil nirvāṇa.</p>
<p>“I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“I was liberated from births and deaths</p>
<p>In the transmigration of existence.</p>
<p>Having dispelled sorrow and lamentation,</p>
<p>I was entirely liberated.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Jyotiṣka</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the seventeenth section: The Section of Jyotiṣka.</p>
<p>8. Rāṣṭrapāla</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, “O Venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, the venerable Jyotiṣka has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Rāṣṭrapāla, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When there was a king named Kṛkin,</p>
<p>Who brought prosperity to the country of Kāśi,</p>
<p>At that time I was</p>
<p>King Kṛkin’s youngest son.</p>
<p>“He had a large stūpa built</p>
<p>For Kāśyapa, the glorious one.</p>
<p>Obeying my father’s wishes,</p>
<p>I offered there a little parasol.</p>
<p>“Through setting a parasol on the stūpa</p>
<p>With my mind pleased,</p>
<p>I made a wish to go forth</p>
<p>And be in the company of the Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“This is my final life.</p>
<p>I was born in Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.</p>
<p>In the house of the head of a guild there,</p>
<p>And so became a son of a good family.</p>
<p>“Along with the master of the people Kauravya,</p>
<p>I was lovable and pleasing to everyone.</p>
<p>Likewise, I was pleasing</p>
<p>To provincial dwellers and my relatives.</p>
<p>“Attractive, pleasant to behold,</p>
<p>Well proportioned, endowed with a very handsome figure,</p>
<p>I abundantly possessed every object of desire</p>
<p>Made possible by human riches.</p>
<p>“Then the lovable, pleasant Teacher</p>
<p>Came to Sthūlakoṣṭhaka.</p>
<p>When I saw him, with a pure mind</p>
<p>I asked him for permission to go forth.</p>
<p>“The Teacher, the matchless man,</p>
<p>Who knew every thought of others,</p>
<p>Knew my thoughts, though,</p>
<p>And refused to let me go forth:</p>
<p>“ ‘Without parental permission,</p>
<p>The buddhas do not let a man go forth,</p>
<p>Even if he is good.</p>
<p>Go and secure your release.’</p>
<p>“Then I went home</p>
<p>And requested my two parents,</p>
<p>‘Dear ones, please allow me</p>
<p>To go forth into homelessness.’</p>
<p>“When my parents heard this from me,</p>
<p>It caused them great grief:</p>
<p>‘Our only son, neither of us</p>
<p>Will allow you to do this, even if we die.’</p>
<p>“When I heard this,</p>
<p>I lay on the ground, saying,</p>
<p>‘If you do not allow it,</p>
<p>I will not eat any food, and will die right here.’</p>
<p>“Then, prompted by the white dharmas,</p>
<p>Desiring to go forth,</p>
<p>Wishing for freedom, for six days</p>
<p>I abstained from eating food.</p>
<p>“Then my friends, who were the same age as I,</p>
<p>Said to my parents,</p>
<p>‘If you allow him, it will be fine.</p>
<p>What good would his death do for you?</p>
<p>“ ‘If he is pleased</p>
<p>To go forth, later</p>
<p>You will see him alive.</p>
<p>What good could come if he dies?</p>
<p>“ ‘If he is not pleased</p>
<p>With his having gone forth,</p>
<p>He will come back to you. Where else would a son</p>
<p>Have a place, except with his parents?’</p>
<p>“Then my two parents said</p>
<p>To my friends, who spoke for me,</p>
<p>‘If he lets us meet him after having gone forth,</p>
<p>We will allow him to go. Otherwise, we will not.’</p>
<p>“Then my friends</p>
<p>Came to me and said,</p>
<p>‘O learned man, you are allowed</p>
<p>By your parents to go forth.</p>
<p>“ ‘Your two parents say to you,</p>
<p>“If you let us meet you</p>
<p>After having gone forth,</p>
<p>Our only son, leave and go forth.” ’</p>
<p>“ ‘Excellent!’ I answered.</p>
<p>Then, delighted,</p>
<p>I went to the Teacher</p>
<p>And spoke thus:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Honored One, I am allowed.</p>
<p>O great Muni, I ask you for permission,</p>
<p>O Sugata, to go forth in your teaching.</p>
<p>May the Victor let me go forth!’</p>
<p>“Thereupon I went forth</p>
<p>And thus lived within the Teacher’s teaching.</p>
<p>Now all my fetters are exhausted,</p>
<p>And my impurities are destroyed.</p>
<p>“Since I had given a parasol,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I dwelt among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who dwell in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Therefore, make your mind filled with faith</p>
<p>Toward the Victor, who possesses great compassion.</p>
<p>Venerate a stūpa.</p>
<p>Be liberated from great fear.”</p>
<p>Thus the elder renowned as Rāṣṭrapāla,</p>
<p>The wearer of a robe of refuse rags,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the eighteenth section: The Section of Rāṣṭrapāla.</p>
<p>9. Svāti</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Svāti, “O Venerable Svāti, the venerable Rāṣṭrapāla has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Svāti, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Svāti did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“I was the best of</p>
<p>The heads of the guilds in Rājagṛha.</p>
<p>I served five hundred ṛṣis</p>
<p>During the rainy season.</p>
<p>“All the five hundred heads of the guilds</p>
<p>Met together there</p>
<p>And each accepted a ṛṣi</p>
<p>At each house.</p>
<p>“They always gave to each ascetic</p>
<p>Foods the same as</p>
<p>Those they prepared</p>
<p>For themselves.</p>
<p>“Among them, one old ṛṣi</p>
<p>Was assigned to me.</p>
<p>He was the best Muni,</p>
<p>Befitting the best of the heads of the guilds.</p>
<p>“I used to have a basket filled with a meal,</p>
<p>As much as five hundred helpings, served to me.</p>
<p>I gave such an amount of food</p>
<p>To the monk.</p>
<p>“Then I entertained a stingy,</p>
<p>Dreadful thought there:</p>
<p>‘I have never given</p>
<p>Such food even to my wife.</p>
<p>“ ‘Neither have I to my sister,</p>
<p>Son, daughter,</p>
<p>Or brother.</p>
<p>“ ‘It is nonsense to give it</p>
<p>To this monk for three months.</p>
<p>Since food for five hundred people</p>
<p>Is a great outlay for me,</p>
<p>“ ‘I will now</p>
<p>Dare to kill this śramaṇa.</p>
<p>If he dies,</p>
<p>I will lose nothing.’</p>
<p>“Harboring such evil thoughts,</p>
<p>I then boiled horse urine</p>
<p>And, in order to kill the faultless one,</p>
<p>Gave it to him together with other foods.</p>
<p>“As soon as he ate that food,</p>
<p>He contracted an unbearable illness,</p>
<p>And his bowels, coiled intestine, and kidneys</p>
<p>Dropped out from the lower part of his body.</p>
<p>“The Muni, who was pleased with the good qualities of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Died, knowing my act.</p>
<p>Gods and yakṣas</p>
<p>Spoke out to each other:</p>
<p>“ ‘Alas, how sinful this head of a guild is!</p>
<p>He killed this Muni, this self-awakened one,</p>
<p>Who was peaceful, free from impurity,</p>
<p>And powerful!’</p>
<p>“All my relatives were also upset</p>
<p>And then they reproached me:</p>
<p>‘Why did you commit such a fault,</p>
<p>Killing this Muni?’</p>
<p>“Having heard the words of my relatives,</p>
<p>I finally felt distressed.</p>
<p>I collected the ṛṣis together</p>
<p>And then confessed my sin.</p>
<p>“Begging for forgiveness, I then</p>
<p>Confessed every sin.</p>
<p>I satisfied the five hundred ṛṣis</p>
<p>Respectfully with food.</p>
<p>“After having confessed the sin,</p>
<p>Begged for forgiveness,</p>
<p>And satisfied those ṛṣis with food and drink,</p>
<p>I then made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘May I always be in the company</p>
<p>Of elders equal to them.</p>
<p>Just as they are all liberated,</p>
<p>May I be liberated from the fetters.</p>
<p>“ ‘May I never be born</p>
<p>In a house of the poor.</p>
<p>May my mind</p>
<p>Never give rise to stinginess!’</p>
<p>“Since I had created dreadful karma,</p>
<p>Which was killing a self-awakened one,</p>
<p>After dying there,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells.</p>
<p>“I experienced suffering</p>
<p>For as long a time as thousands of years.</p>
<p>When I returned to human life,</p>
<p>I was fabulously wealthy.</p>
<p>“Although I was respected by people,</p>
<p>I used to die young</p>
<p>And always died</p>
<p>With my bowels dropping out.</p>
<p>“I abandoned the marks of a layman</p>
<p>And went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>Since I exerted myself in the teachings,</p>
<p>I removed every desire.</p>
<p>“Although I am emancipated,</p>
<p>Having no further existence,</p>
<p>My bowels, coiled intestine, and kidneys</p>
<p>Have dropped out again.</p>
<p>“I created an evil karma</p>
<p>And created a good karma.</p>
<p>And so I experienced the fruits</p>
<p>Of these good and evil actions.”</p>
<p>Thus Svāti, the monk of great power,</p>
<p>Who was born in Śrāvastī,</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>

<p>10. Jaṅghākāśyapa</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Jaṅghākāśyapa, “O Venerable Jaṅghākāśyapa,  the venerable Svāti has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Jaṅghākāśyapa, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Jaṅghākāśyapa did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When a famine broke out,</p>
<p>All the citizens invited</p>
<p>The community of monks</p>
<p>For seven years.</p>
<p>“There came</p>
<p>A certain self-awakened one, a fortunate one,</p>
<p>Peaceful, untainted,</p>
<p>The beautiful Muni, who was assigned to me.</p>
<p>“I had made a promise</p>
<p>That I would not give food</p>
<p>To anyone who would not work,</p>
<p>Even if it was my own son or another family member.</p>
<p>“Having made such a promise,</p>
<p>I entertained an evil thought:</p>
<p>‘Why would I give food to this monk,</p>
<p>Who does not work?’</p>
<p>“Then I made the ṛṣi accompany me</p>
<p>So that he saw farm work.</p>
<p>Only after I had taken him around everywhere</p>
<p>Did I let him eat.</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells</p>
<p>Such as Being Crushed and Heat,</p>
<p>And underwent suffering.</p>
<p>“After I died in hell,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I had difficulties in obtaining food</p>
<p>In spite of my many efforts.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having gone forth in faith,</p>
<p>I destroyed my impurities.</p>
<p>Having achieved the six kinds of supernormal knowledge,</p>
<p>I attained the state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Still, O honored ones, even now,</p>
<p>When I possess such magical power,</p>
<p>I have to walk a long way to find food</p>
<p>And have difficulty obtaining it.</p>
<p>“Whenever I obtain food,</p>
<p>I do so</p>
<p>Only after being fatigued</p>
<p>From walking such a long way.”</p>
<p>Thus the one whose family was Kāśyapa and whose name</p>
<p>After his act was Jaṅghā, who possessed great power,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>

<p>E. Verses of the Elders III</p>
<p>1. Panthaka</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Cūḍapanthaka, “O Venerable Cūḍapanthaka, the venerable Jaṅghākāśyapa has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Cūḍapanthaka did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In another life in the past,</p>
<p>I was a pig keeper.</p>
<p>I used to tie my pigs’ mouths shut</p>
<p>And take them across the river.</p>
<p>“Once, while taking them across the river,</p>
<p>I reached the middle</p>
<p>And the pigs panicked and were unable to breathe,</p>
<p>And all of them died.</p>
<p>“Without protection, helpless,</p>
<p>I too was floating in the river.</p>
<p>Merciful ṛṣis</p>
<p>Came and pulled me out.</p>
<p>“They saved me from there,</p>
<p>And thereupon I went forth.</p>
<p>Without instruction, I practiced the</p>
<p>Meditation on unconsciousness.</p>
<p>“Then I died and</p>
<p>Was born among the gods.</p>
<p>When I died in the world of the gods,</p>
<p>I attained a human life.</p>
<p>“Having pleased the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>Foolish and unintelligent,</p>
<p>I did not understand the teachings.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, for three months</p>
<p>I contemplated a single verse.</p>
<p>When I finally understood a quarter of the verse consisting of four words,</p>
<p>I completely removed desire.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, thus I</p>
<p>Remember the karma I created.</p>
<p>I ran around through the course of transmigration</p>
<p>For an eon—not an insignificant amount of time, but long.”</p>
<p>Thus, in the presence of the protector of the world,</p>
<p>Cūḍapanthaka explained</p>
<p>Positive and negative actions</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-first section: The Section of Cūḍapanthaka.</p>
<p>2. Sarpadāsa</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders  requested the venerable Sarpadāsa, “O Venerable Sarpadāsa, the venerable Cūḍapanthaka has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Sarpadāsa did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“After the Buddha Kāśyapa’s nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>As the last monk, I was</p>
<p>Versed in the three divisions of the canon. I had learned much</p>
<p>But was stingy with the Dharma.</p>
<p>“Thinking that if other monks were knowledgeable,</p>
<p>They would become equal to me,</p>
<p>I did not teach or preach</p>
<p>The Dharma to monks.</p>
<p>“Whichever monks came to me</p>
<p>And asked questions,</p>
<p>I did not instruct any of them</p>
<p>But reproached all of them and turned them away.</p>
<p>“Monks came to me</p>
<p>And then served me.</p>
<p>They said, ‘It is not good of you</p>
<p>Not to teach the Dharma.’</p>
<p>“After that, when the time of death came for me,</p>
<p>I felt regret:</p>
<p>‘It was not good of me</p>
<p>Not to teach the Dharma to others.’</p>
<p>“There was as little time</p>
<p>As seven days left for me.</p>
<p>I gathered together the mendicants</p>
<p>And then confessed my sin.</p>
<p>“Having confessed the sin</p>
<p>And removed my stinginess,</p>
<p>Then, for seven nights,</p>
<p>I preached the Dharma that was rich in excellent meaning.</p>
<p>“After they had heard the Dharma</p>
<p>Preached as skillfully as possible with my knowledge,</p>
<p>I let them talk to</p>
<p>And teach each other.</p>
<p>“Since at that time</p>
<p>I had preached the Dharma a little for seven nights,</p>
<p>I enjoyed myself in the world of gods,</p>
<p>Which was rich with every object of desire.</p>
<p>“After I died in the world of the gods,</p>
<p>I attained a human life</p>
<p>And was born into the Śākyan royal family</p>
<p>In the city of Kapilavastu.</p>
<p>“Possessing great wealth and many possessions,</p>
<p>Well proportioned, pleasant to behold,</p>
<p>And lovable and pleasing to everyone,</p>
<p>I was blessed with perfection.</p>
<p>“Although people born into each family</p>
<p>Went forth into homelessness,</p>
<p>I was not able to go forth</p>
<p>Because I possessed an abundance of the objects of desire.</p>
<p>“The Completely Awakened One, the matchless man,</p>
<p>Having compassion for me,</p>
<p>Encouraged me again and again</p>
<p>To go forth.</p>
<p>“Then I said</p>
<p>To the matchless caravan leader, the Buddha,</p>
<p>‘For the time being, for seven years,</p>
<p>I will give donations that are not insignificant.</p>
<p>“ ‘After seven years have passed</p>
<p>And I have given such donations,</p>
<p>I will go forth before you</p>
<p>Who have supreme wisdom.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Seven years is long,’ he replied,</p>
<p>‘But life is short.</p>
<p>Who knows if you will die tomorrow?</p>
<p>Be converted and do it this very day!’</p>
<p>“Out of respect,</p>
<p>I did not disobey the Buddha’s words but said,</p>
<p>‘O Honored One, please, in seven days</p>
<p>Let me go forth, having compassion.’</p>
<p>“After I had given donations</p>
<p>And satisfied the poor for seven days,</p>
<p>My relatives placed lookouts for me</p>
<p>Throughout the city.</p>
<p>“They illuminated that most excellent city</p>
<p>With immense lights.</p>
<p>Without being noticed by people, however,</p>
<p>I escaped to go forth.</p>
<p>“I went forth out of faith</p>
<p>And exerted myself in the Victor’s teachings,</p>
<p>But I was not able to achieve even concentration of mind,</p>
<p>Even after twenty-five years.</p>
<p>“Then I entertained an evil thought</p>
<p>Of attachment to the objects of desire:</p>
<p>‘I have not understood the nectar,</p>
<p>So I will return again to the lower life.’</p>
<p>“Then I felt shame, ignominy,</p>
<p>Which was of great benefit, and thought,</p>
<p>‘If my relatives reproach me</p>
<p>And count me as a stain on them,</p>
<p>“ ‘That would not be suitable for me.</p>
<p>That would not be good.</p>
<p>Is there any reason for such a one like me to live?</p>
<p>I will kill myself with a sword.’</p>
<p>“I took a sharp sword</p>
<p>And sat down with my legs crossed.</p>
<p>When I put the blade against my neck,</p>
<p>Then my mind was emancipated.</p>
<p>“Liberated from my rigid thoughts,</p>
<p>I chanted again and again,</p>
<p>‘O Buddha, O Dharma, O Saṅgha!</p>
<p>O excellent nature of the Dharma!’</p>
<p>“Once, I conceived the thought</p>
<p>That it would be better that an ordinary person die.</p>
<p>Since I had relinquished my life,</p>
<p>I attained the supreme tranquility.</p>
<p>“Once, because of my narrow mind,</p>
<p>I was stingy with the excellent Dharma.</p>
<p>O honored ones, the fruit of that was</p>
<p>Difficulty in being emancipated.</p>
<p>“I did preach the excellent Dharma, though,</p>
<p>At the time of my death.</p>
<p>Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I was endowed with perfection.”</p>
<p>Thus, the Śākyan of dull faculties,</p>
<p>Sarpadāsa, who possessed great power,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-second section: The Section of Sarpadāsa.</p>
<p>3. Aniruddha</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Aniruddha, “O Venerable Aniruddha, the venerable Sarpadāsa has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Aniruddha, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Aniruddha did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once when I was a poor grass-cutter,</p>
<p>Carrying a load on my shoulder,</p>
<p>I offered almsfood to a renowned śramaṇa,</p>
<p>Who had destroyed his defilements.</p>
<p>“Born into the family of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I was known to be unobstructed (aniruddha).</p>
<p>I was skilled in music and singing</p>
<p>And constantly heard the sound of cymbals.</p>
<p>“I saw the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The Teacher, who is not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>When I saw him, with my mind filled with faith,</p>
<p>I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“Having heard his words,</p>
<p>I dwelled with delight in the teaching,</p>
<p>Always relying upon the vanquisher of enemies,</p>
<p>And I heedfully exerted myself.</p>
<p>“I accomplished what the Buddha had taught</p>
<p>And attained the threefold knowledge.</p>
<p>I came to know my former lives,</p>
<p>Where I had once been.</p>
<p>“I was born seven times</p>
<p>Among the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>
<p>Also, among humans,</p>
<p>Seven times I was the people’s master.</p>
<p>“Then I was anointed as a kṣatriya</p>
<p>Ruling the continent of Jambu.</p>
<p>Seven times here, seven times there—</p>
<p>I was thus reborn fourteen times.</p>
<p>I came to know my former lives,</p>
<p>Where I had once been.</p>
<p>“At that time, I enjoyed</p>
<p>The fruit of such karma.</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I lived amid pleasure.</p>
<p>“I realized how beings die,</p>
<p>How they come and go,</p>
<p>How they become thus and otherwise,</p>
<p>And the joy of the noble ones’ five-factored meditation.</p>
<p>“Directing my attention tranquilly and devotedly</p>
<p>To the meditation consisting of five factors,</p>
<p>I purified my divine sight</p>
<p>Through the fully purified path.</p>
<p>“Knowing my mind,</p>
<p>The Teacher, who was the highest in the world,</p>
<p>Came to me by his magical power,</p>
<p>Manifesting in his spiritual body.</p>
<p>“The Teacher, who rejoices at freedom from conceptual proliferation,</p>
<p>Taught me how to be rid of conceptual proliferation.</p>
<p>Having heard his words,</p>
<p>I dwelled with delight in the teaching.</p>
<p>“Always relying upon the vanquisher of enemies,</p>
<p>I heedfully exerted myself.</p>
<p>I accomplished what the Buddha taught</p>
<p>And attained the threefold knowledge.</p>
<p>“Not rejoicing at death,</p>
<p>Not rejoicing at life,</p>
<p>Possessing intelligence and recollection,</p>
<p>At the appropriate time, I engage in observation.</p>
<p>“In the bamboo thicket</p>
<p>In the village of Beluva,</p>
<p>After my life is exhausted,</p>
<p>I will be emancipated as an untainted one.</p>
<p>“This is the fruit I gained</p>
<p>By giving almsfood.</p>
<p>I have pleased the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The matchless man, the Teacher.</p>
<p>“I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who are endowed with merit.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Aniruddha</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-third section: The Section of Aniruddha.</p>
<p>4. Kāla</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Kāla Mṛgāraputra, “O Venerable Kāla, the venerable Aniruddha has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable One, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Kāla Mṛgāraputra did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When I was squeezing sugarcane</p>
<p>In a guḍa-making hut,</p>
<p>A self-awakened one, a fortunate one,</p>
<p>Came in, sick and in need of a remedy.</p>
<p>“I offered guḍa and oil</p>
<p>To the Muni for seven nights.</p>
<p>The fortunate one, when seven days had passed,</p>
<p>Soared up into the air.</p>
<p>“After that, a slave who had served him</p>
<p>Said to me,</p>
<p>‘That mendicant worthy of veneration</p>
<p>Has left.’</p>
<p>“When I heard from him</p>
<p>That the ṛṣi had left through the air,</p>
<p>I was delighted and satisfied</p>
<p>And then acquired faith.</p>
<p>“Because of that pure mind</p>
<p>And that guḍa given,</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Still now, O honored ones,</p>
<p>I have obtained many benefits,</p>
<p>Such as robes, almsfood,</p>
<p>Requisites, and bedding and a seat.</p>
<p>“When I had my robes sewn,</p>
<p>I thought I needed</p>
<p>Four vessels of guḍa</p>
<p>To serve some guḍa drink.</p>
<p>“Then a god advised</p>
<p>King Bimbisāra,</p>
<p>‘Give some guḍa drink</p>
<p>To Kāla Mṛgāraputra.</p>
<p>“ ‘O master of humans, your giving the guḍa drink</p>
<p>Will cause great merit.</p>
<p>Send guḍa to Mṛgāraputra</p>
<p>In the mango grove of Jīvaka!’</p>
<p>“Bimbisāra, the best of kings,</p>
<p>Who possessed great power,</p>
<p>Offered me four large vessels</p>
<p>Filled with guḍa.</p>
<p>“Then, after delicious guḍa</p>
<p>Was brought by him,</p>
<p>The community of one thousand two hundred and fifty monks</p>
<p>Was satisfied.”</p>
<p>Thus Mṛgāraputra, who was an arhat</p>
<p>Possessing the six kinds of supernormal knowledge and great power,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-fourth section: The Section of Kāla Mṛgāraputra.</p>
<p>5. Rāhula</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Rāhula, “O Venerable Rāhula, the venerable Kāla Mṛgāraputra has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Rāhula, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Rāhula did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“I was once the monarch,</p>
<p>The king of Mithilā in Videha.</p>
<p>When I was sitting for some business</p>
<p>And giving orders to my retainers,</p>
<p>“A ṛṣi engaged in great ascetic practice,</p>
<p>Who had a terrifying splendor, arrived.</p>
<p>He approached me</p>
<p>And spoke these words:</p>
<p>“ ‘O master of the earth, I am a thief,</p>
<p>For I have drunk some water that was not given to me.</p>
<p>May you impose a penalty,</p>
<p>The same as you would on a thief.’</p>
<p>“I replied to the ṛṣi,</p>
<p>Who delighted in the good quality of the Dharma,</p>
<p>‘The water is allowed to you.</p>
<p>Go and enjoy it.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O King, my regret</p>
<p>Cannot be removed by such a thing.</p>
<p>Impose a penalty on me,</p>
<p>And I will be free from doubts.’</p>
<p>“I banished him</p>
<p>To a park for six days.</p>
<p>After six days had passed,</p>
<p>He left for his hermitage.</p>
<p>“Since I had committed a sin,</p>
<p>Though not out of anger,</p>
<p>I was boiled for sixty years</p>
<p>In the Intense Heat and Black Cord Hells.</p>
<p>“Because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>In my final body,</p>
<p>I stayed in my mother’s womb</p>
<p>For six years.</p>
<p>“Without anger,</p>
<p>I created karma of body and speech.</p>
<p>Its fruit has been experienced,</p>
<p>For actions never vanish.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Rāhula</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-fifth section: The Section of Rāhula.</p>
<p>6. Nanda</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Nanda,  “O Venerable Nanda, the venerable Rāhula has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Nanda, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Nanda did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In Vipaśyin’s dispensation,</p>
<p>I once offered a bath.</p>
<p>After the community of monks had bathed,</p>
<p>I then made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘May I always be in the company</p>
<p>Of elders equal to them.</p>
<p>May I be clean, taintless,</p>
<p>Free from defilements, and rid of impurities.</p>
<p>“ ‘May I have a fine-colored face</p>
<p>And an excellent appearance!’</p>
<p>Thereupon, after dying there,</p>
<p>I was born among the gods.</p>
<p>“I was born among humans and gods</p>
<p>Who were golden in complexion.</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I lived with many possessions.</p>
<p>“I built a pure white stūpa</p>
<p>For a self-awakened one.</p>
<p>Then I anointed it with ointment</p>
<p>So that it became entirely yellow.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, desiring the auspicious marks,</p>
<p>I made a wish</p>
<p>For golden-colored skin,</p>
<p>A beautiful figure, and excellent appearance.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>I was born in the city of Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>As the middle son of Kṛkin,</p>
<p>The king of Kāśi.</p>
<p>“When I saw the stūpa of Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>It increased my faith.</p>
<p>I had a middle-sized parasol</p>
<p>Set on the stūpa.</p>
<p>“Because of the bathing, the steam bath,</p>
<p>Anointing with turmeric,</p>
<p>And having the parasol set,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>“Because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>In this final existence of mine</p>
<p>I was born into the Śākyan royal family</p>
<p>And became the brother of the Buddha, the Protector.</p>
<p>“The marks of a great man</p>
<p>On this body of mine</p>
<p>Are no more than thirty,</p>
<p>And no less than thirty.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who are beautiful.</p>
<p>Having removed sin and exhausted impurities,</p>
<p>I attained the foremost state.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Nanda</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-sixth section: The Section of Nanda.</p>
<p>7. Dravya</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Dravya Mallaputra, “O Venerable Dravya Mallaputra, the venerable Nanda has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Dravya Mallaputra, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Dravya Mallaputra did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“I was once a merchant</p>
<p>Named Fisherman.</p>
<p>When I traveled for business,</p>
<p>I fell in with a ṛṣi,</p>
<p>“An untainted self-awakened one,</p>
<p>Who had attained power and was free from defilements.</p>
<p>I always invited him for meals</p>
<p>During our travels.</p>
<p>“In each place we stayed,</p>
<p>I spread out carpets</p>
<p>And set out water for washing feet, oil,</p>
<p>And a lamp.</p>
<p>“During our travels,</p>
<p>I served him.</p>
<p>In due course, the merchants</p>
<p>Arrived at the seashore.</p>
<p>“The monk approached a ship,</p>
<p>And then I asked him,</p>
<p>‘O honored one, why will you go to sea,</p>
<p>Seeking treasure?</p>
<p>“ ‘O honored one, we, the poor,</p>
<p>Seeking the objects of desire,</p>
<p>Take to the great ocean</p>
<p>In spite of the danger.’</p>
<p>“The monk said to me,</p>
<p>‘I have been emancipated.</p>
<p>May you together with your relatives</p>
<p>Have great wealth and merit and become happy!’</p>
<p>“Then, with joy, I gave him</p>
<p>A beautiful robe.</p>
<p>Having bowed down,</p>
<p>I circumambulated him.</p>
<p>“Out of his compassion for me,</p>
<p>He then accepted the robe.</p>
<p>Thereupon he soared up into the air</p>
<p>While all the merchants were watching him.</p>
<p>“Having seen this miracle performed,</p>
<p>And then, sorrowful,</p>
<p>Making the gesture of supplication,</p>
<p>I made an aspiration:</p>
<p>“ ‘May I always be in the company</p>
<p>Of elders equal to him!</p>
<p>May I attain the qualities</p>
<p>That he has attained!</p>
<p>“ ‘May I, pleasing a Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>Succeed in going forth,</p>
<p>And serve the community</p>
<p>By my magical power and miracles!’</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>I enjoyed the world of the gods.</p>
<p>When I obtained a human life,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>“In each life</p>
<p>I was fabulously wealthy.</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“In this final eon,</p>
<p>In my final existence,</p>
<p>I was born as Mallaputra</p>
<p>Among the Mallas in Kuśinagarī.</p>
<p>“Pleasant to behold, attractive,</p>
<p>And well proportioned, well behaved,</p>
<p>Lovable, and pleasing to everyone,</p>
<p>I was blessed with perfection.</p>
<p>“I pleased the Buddha,</p>
<p>Lion of the Śākyans, the Supreme One.</p>
<p>Having seen him, with my mind filled with faith,</p>
<p>I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“When I passed through the mountains of Magadha</p>
<p>And settled in the Bamboo Grove,</p>
<p>Some disciples approached that place,</p>
<p>Bringing harm to the community of monks.</p>
<p>“Even in the distribution of bedding and seats,</p>
<p>They scolded,</p>
<p>Hurt, and reproached the monks</p>
<p>And reviled them again and again.</p>
<p>“Seeing my fellow monks,</p>
<p>I had compassion for them, thinking,</p>
<p>‘Even after I have exhausted my impurities</p>
<p>I myself will serve monks.’</p>
<p>“I began to exert myself.</p>
<p>And since I had exerted myself in this teaching,</p>
<p>I attained the state of an arhat</p>
<p>And became powerful in the six kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“I went to the Teacher,</p>
<p>Bowed to the Muni,</p>
<p>Made the gesture of supplication above my head,</p>
<p>And said to the supreme man:</p>
<p>“ ‘O Muni, please allow me</p>
<p>To serve the monks,</p>
<p>Not out of desire or ignorance</p>
<p>But with thoughts of love and respect.’</p>
<p>“The Teacher, who was skillful in knowing others’ minds,</p>
<p>Understood my offer</p>
<p>And allowed me to perform true service</p>
<p>To the community of monks.</p>
<p>“By loving physical acts,</p>
<p>And by verbal and mental acts as well,</p>
<p>I always remained modest</p>
<p>And served the community of monks.</p>
<p>“I was pleased to see monks</p>
<p>Who were traveling or</p>
<p>Who returned after traveling,</p>
<p>And I was satisfied with each of them.</p>
<p>“Displaying my magical power</p>
<p>By which my five fingers emitted light</p>
<p>As if they were burning lamps,</p>
<p>I prepared bedding and seats.</p>
<p>“Those monks who wanted to see</p>
<p>This miracle of mine</p>
<p>Approached me in the dark</p>
<p>When evening fell.</p>
<p>“I prepared bedding and seats</p>
<p>For them appropriately</p>
<p>With thoughts of love and respect,</p>
<p>And many people were deeply moved.</p>
<p>“What I had thought of</p>
<p>And what I had made a wish for—</p>
<p>Having completed those good deeds,</p>
<p>I attained the immovable state.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Dravya Mallaputra,</p>
<p>Who was untainted and powerful,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-seventh section: The Section of Dravya Mallaputra.</p>
<p>8. Upasena</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Upasena, “O Venerable Upasena, the venerable Dravya Mallaputra has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Upasena, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upasena did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When I was a hunter</p>
<p>In a past time,</p>
<p>I observed some animals</p>
<p>When I was looking around in a vast, pleasant forest.</p>
<p>“Carrying a bundle of arrows smeared with poison</p>
<p>And a bow, I went</p>
<p>From one dangerous part of the mountain to another,</p>
<p>Which was abundant in animals.</p>
<p>“Whenever I saw an animal,</p>
<p>I entertained malicious thoughts.</p>
<p>I shot many animals</p>
<p>With arrows smeared with poison.</p>
<p>“With that bow and</p>
<p>Arrows smeared with poison in my hand,</p>
<p>I saw a self-awakened one</p>
<p>Sitting under a tree.</p>
<p>“At the sight of the śramaṇa,</p>
<p>I experienced an unpleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Then I shot an arrow at the body of the Muni,</p>
<p>Who did not possess any malice.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the monk,</p>
<p>Suffering the pain caused by the arrow,</p>
<p>Was emancipated without remainder</p>
<p>Under that very tree.</p>
<p>“Since I had performed that savage act,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells</p>
<p>And experienced suffering there</p>
<p>For thousands of years.</p>
<p>“At a certain point I died in hell</p>
<p>And was reborn as an animal—</p>
<p>Born among those very animals</p>
<p>In the dangerous parts of the mountain.</p>
<p>“Always frightened, anxious,</p>
<p>Hungry, and tormented by thirst,</p>
<p>I was weary and suffering</p>
<p>And wandered here and there.</p>
<p>“In that dangerous place, malicious,</p>
<p>Dreadful hunters</p>
<p>Shot sharp arrows smeared with poison</p>
<p>At my body.</p>
<p>“Having seen me fall,</p>
<p>While I was still alive and trembling</p>
<p>They cut the flesh from my body with swords</p>
<p>And carried it away.</p>
<p>“I was killed in that very place</p>
<p>For the sake of my flesh.</p>
<p>Thus, I experienced many such sufferings</p>
<p>For five hundred lives.</p>
<p>“At the foot of the mountain</p>
<p>I saw many ṛṣis</p>
<p>Engaged in ascetic practice, who possessed great power,</p>
<p>Great magical power, and fearful splendor.</p>
<p>“When I saw the ṛṣis,</p>
<p>I entertained a thought of love.</p>
<p>I met them, endowed with goodwill and love,</p>
<p>Again and again.</p>
<p>“I respectfully made my mind filled with faith</p>
<p>In those ascetics.</p>
<p>Because of this root of merit,</p>
<p>I attained a human life.</p>
<p>“Whenever I saw a self-awakened one</p>
<p>Begging for food,</p>
<p>I always respectfully invited him</p>
<p>For a meal.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, having satisfied him,</p>
<p>I then made an aspiration:</p>
<p>‘May I always be in the company</p>
<p>Of ṛṣis equal to him.</p>
<p>“ ‘Pleasing the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>May I succeed in going forth</p>
<p>And dwell in the untainted state,</p>
<p>Which is free from fear and dread.’</p>
<p>“Since had I created this good karma,</p>
<p>I enjoyed the world of the gods.</p>
<p>Once I attained a human birth,</p>
<p>I became wealthy and possessed much property.</p>
<p>“I pleased the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The matchless man, the Teacher.</p>
<p>Having seen Śākyamuni,</p>
<p>I went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“Having gone forth out of faith</p>
<p>And lived joyfully with the teachings,</p>
<p>I attained the state of an arhat</p>
<p>And became powerful in the six kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Still, O honored ones,</p>
<p>Though I have brought all under control,</p>
<p>When I entered a cave</p>
<p>And death approached me,</p>
<p>A dreadful poisonous snake</p>
<p>Fell on my body.</p>
<p>“O Honored Ones, this is the sin</p>
<p>That I remember committing.</p>
<p>Its fruit has been experienced,</p>
<p>For actions never vanish.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Upasena</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-eighth section: The Section of Upasena.</p>
<p>9. Bhadrika</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Bhadrika, “O Venerable Bhadrika, the venerable Upasena has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Bhadrika, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Bhadrika did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When a severe famine broke out,</p>
<p>Threatening the wilderness,</p>
<p>I was the head of five hundred beggars,</p>
<p>Each seeking food.</p>
<p>“As the leader of them all,</p>
<p>I was served by all of them.</p>
<p>They offered me food</p>
<p>That they had been given.</p>
<p>“Whether good or bad,</p>
<p>They brought me what they had obtained.</p>
<p>They lived following my orders.</p>
<p>They never disrespected me.</p>
<p>“When a certain man carrying a pastry</p>
<p>Passed through the market,</p>
<p>I robbed him of it by force.</p>
<p>I grabbed it and fled.</p>
<p>“I ran then,</p>
<p>But there was no pursuer.</p>
<p>I succeeded in escaping with great fatigue.</p>
<p>They were not able to catch me.</p>
<p>“After reaching the opposite bank of a river,</p>
<p>I sat down in a certain place.</p>
<p>Afraid that somebody might come,</p>
<p>I looked all around.</p>
<p>“When I had eaten some of the pastry,</p>
<p>Which was well cooked in oil,</p>
<p>My stomach was full</p>
<p>And I felt that I had eaten enough for a day.</p>
<p>“Just then there came a certain fortunate one, a self-awakened one,</p>
<p>Whose rebirths were exhausted,</p>
<p>A fearsome ṛṣi</p>
<p>Possessing great magical power and awe-inspiring splendor.</p>
<p>“I thought to myself,</p>
<p>‘Suffering and poor,</p>
<p>I have not made merit before,</p>
<p>Hence such poverty.</p>
<p>“ ‘I will now give</p>
<p>This pure pastry to this śramaṇa</p>
<p>And die from hunger,</p>
<p>Rather than being this poor.’</p>
<p>“My mind was filled with faith in him,</p>
<p>And, with joy and delight,</p>
<p>I offered the pastry to that most excellent monk,</p>
<p>A field of merit who was worthy of veneration.</p>
<p>“The fortunate one accepted it and,</p>
<p>Having compassion for me,</p>
<p>Ate it right there</p>
<p>And then soared up into the sky.</p>
<p>“Then I made an aspiration:</p>
<p>‘May I not be poor</p>
<p>But endowed with a beautiful appearance</p>
<p>And a noble birth.</p>
<p>“ ‘May I always be in the company</p>
<p>Of elders equal to you.</p>
<p>May I realize such Dharma</p>
<p>As you have understood!’</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>I experienced much happiness.</p>
<p>Having made merit,</p>
<p>I was born among beautiful gods and humans.</p>
<p>“I much enjoyed</p>
<p>Divine and human kingship.</p>
<p>Because of that karma,</p>
<p>I never went to inferior states of existence.</p>
<p>“After that, because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>In this final existence</p>
<p>I was born into a noble family</p>
<p>In the capital city of the Śākyans.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Lion of the Śākyans.</p>
<p>“When the Buddha, the Blessed One,</p>
<p>Came to his family’s land,</p>
<p>I then went forth,</p>
<p>Leading my relatives.</p>
<p>“What was my wish</p>
<p>Was perfectly accomplished by me.</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.”</p>
<p>Thus Bhadrika, a relative of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Who had gone forth from the royal family,</p>
<p>Explained his karma</p>
<p>Before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the twenty-ninth section: The Section of Bhadrika, the King of the Śākyans.</p>
<p>10. Lavaṇabhadrika</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Lavaṇabhadrika, “O Venerable Lavaṇabhadrika, the venerable Bhadrika, king of the Śākyans, has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Lavaṇabhadrika, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Lavaṇabhadrika did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“When a stūpa was being built</p>
<p>For the protector Krakucchanda,</p>
<p>I was a stonemason,</p>
<p>A laborer. At that time,</p>
<p>“When building the stūpa,</p>
<p>I remarked again and again,</p>
<p>‘This stūpa is very large.</p>
<p>When will it be finished?</p>
<p>“ ‘If they made this stūpa lower</p>
<p>And smaller,</p>
<p>The construction would be easier and cause less trouble,</p>
<p>And it would soon be finished.’</p>
<p>“Because of my verbal misconduct</p>
<p>And the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>After dying there,</p>
<p>I was born in the hells.</p>
<p>“After dying in hell,</p>
<p>Wherever I was born,</p>
<p>I was ugly and short</p>
<p>And so was slandered by everyone.</p>
<p>“Once when Kāśyapa was preaching,</p>
<p>I was a cuckoo</p>
<p>Living in a dense forest located</p>
<p>In the middle of the path to Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“There, in the presence of the illuminator of the world</p>
<p>And the community of monks,</p>
<p>Singing in a gentle voice,</p>
<p>I circumambulated him in the air.</p>
<p>“When I saw the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>Walking for the sake of alms,</p>
<p>I departed, and continually</p>
<p>Circumambulated him as he walked.</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>I attained a human life.</p>
<p>I have now pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“The All-Seeing One has praised me</p>
<p>As the best of those who speak in a gentle voice,</p>
<p>And for my having learned much, having understood the Dharma,</p>
<p>And being endowed with eloquence.</p>
<p>“The four groups of followers,</p>
<p>Whether gods or humans,</p>
<p>Will hear the sweet, pleasant-sounding Dharma</p>
<p>From me and all be delighted.</p>
<p>“I performed a little good</p>
<p>And much evil.</p>
<p>Its fruit has been experienced,</p>
<p>For actions never vanish.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Lavaṇabhadrika</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>

<p>F. Verses of the Elders IV</p>
<p>1. Madhuvāsiṣṭha</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Madhuvāsiṣṭha, “O Venerable Madhuvāsiṣṭha, the venerable Lavaṇabhadrika has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Madhuvāsiṣṭha, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Madhuvāsiṣṭha did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once when I was a great monkey,</p>
<p>King of the monkeys, in Vaiśālī,</p>
<p>I saw many bowls</p>
<p>And then took the Victor’s bowl.</p>
<p>“Monks stopped me,</p>
<p>But then the Blessed One said,</p>
<p>‘Monks, you should not stop him,</p>
<p>For he will not break the bowl.’</p>
<p>“Carrying the Teacher’s bowl,</p>
<p>I climbed to the top of a tree,</p>
<p>Filled it with honey,</p>
<p>And then carefully descended.</p>
<p>“When I held the bowl of honey</p>
<p>And offered it to the Teacher,</p>
<p>The Teacher did not accept it from me,</p>
<p>Knowing that an insect was in it.</p>
<p>“I went to one side</p>
<p>And saw there was an insect in it.</p>
<p>I cleaned the insect from it</p>
<p>And brought it to the Teacher.</p>
<p>“But the Blessed One still</p>
<p>Did not accept the honey from me.</p>
<p>I thought that the Sugata knew it was impure</p>
<p>And so did not accept it.</p>
<p>“Then I poured water</p>
<p>Into the bowl of honey</p>
<p>And, with delight and pleasure,</p>
<p>Offered it to the Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“The tender hands</p>
<p>Of the matchless man, the Teacher,</p>
<p>Then received the bowl from me</p>
<p>And gave it to his disciples.</p>
<p>“Much pleased,</p>
<p>I respectfully made the gesture of supplication.</p>
<p>Thereupon, dancing, I departed</p>
<p>From the presence of the Dharma King.</p>
<p>“Then I made an aspiration:</p>
<p>‘May I, having attained a human life,</p>
<p>Depending on this Teacher for support,</p>
<p>Attain this supreme awakening!’</p>
<p>“By this root of merit,</p>
<p>I attained a human birth.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having attained awakening</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“I am an arhat, powerful,</p>
<p>Possessing the six kinds of supernormal knowledge and great magical power.</p>
<p>Monks know me</p>
<p>As Madhuvāsiṣṭha.</p>
<p>“Since I have made merit, possessing high repute,</p>
<p>I am always served and venerated.</p>
<p>Once when I traveled,</p>
<p>Surrounded by the community of monks,</p>
<p>“In the path in the wilderness</p>
<p>All the monks of the community became thirsty.</p>
<p>There I made a wish in my mind:</p>
<p>‘May honey be obtained today!’</p>
<p>“Then nonhumans brought honey</p>
<p>From all directions, knowing my wish.</p>
<p>I received it</p>
<p>And gave it to the monks.</p>
<p>“Having received from excellent ones</p>
<p>As much honey as we needed,</p>
<p>I satisfied the community of monks,</p>
<p>And then they were greatly content.</p>
<p>“Because of what the king of the monkeys did</p>
<p>In my directly preceding birth,</p>
<p>Even though I had fallen into an animal life,</p>
<p>I died and was reborn, and attained the state of immortality.</p>
<p>“All that I wished for</p>
<p>Has come true.</p>
<p>Since I had served the Teacher,</p>
<p>I fully accomplished my purpose here.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the good deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>I have experienced its pleasant,</p>
<p>Desirable fruit, which causes happiness.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Madhuvāsiṣṭha</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-first section: The Section of Madhuvāsiṣṭha.</p>
<p>2. Hetu</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Hetu, “O Venerable Hetu, the venerable Madhuvāsiṣṭha has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Hetu, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Hetu did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once, ninety-one eons ago,</p>
<p>In the city of Bandhumatī,</p>
<p>I saw the Buddha Vipaśyin</p>
<p>Entering that most excellent city.</p>
<p>“When I saw the one endowed with great compassion,</p>
<p>I scattered flower petals.</p>
<p>A flower took root there, arose,</p>
<p>And became like a palace, facing upward.</p>
<p>“Then, delighted,</p>
<p>I bowed to the Muni’s feet,</p>
<p>Respectfully made the gesture of supplication,</p>
<p>And circumambulated him.</p>
<p>“Without listening to the Dharma</p>
<p>Or seeking refuge,</p>
<p>My mind was filled with faith,</p>
<p>And I departed from the presence of the Sugata.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma</p>
<p>In honor of Vipaśyin, the one of great power,</p>
<p>I did not know any inferior state of existence</p>
<p>For ninety-one eons.</p>
<p>“Enjoying a divine body,</p>
<p>I was blessed with divine objects of desire.</p>
<p>When I again attained a human life,</p>
<p>I was wealthy, possessing much property.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I was born into a brahmin family</p>
<p>Endowed with much wealth and property.</p>
<p>“I learned the science of language, the science of rituals,</p>
<p>The marks of a great man,</p>
<p>And the meanings of words,</p>
<p>And became familiar with my teacher’s mantras.</p>
<p>“When I left my house,</p>
<p>Surrounded by brahmins,</p>
<p>To teach mantras in the forest</p>
<p>To five hundred brahmins,</p>
<p>“I saw the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The one who possesses great bravery,</p>
<p>Accompanied by the community of monks,</p>
<p>Enter the most excellent city of Magadha.</p>
<p>“When I saw the compassionate one,</p>
<p>I was pleased</p>
<p>And examined the marks</p>
<p>Generated by causes in the past.</p>
<p>“I realized that he had accomplished</p>
<p>All thirty-two marks</p>
<p>Of the protector of the world,</p>
<p>And was beautified with the minor marks and possessed high repute.</p>
<p>“Having seen him with his marks,</p>
<p>I bowed to him,</p>
<p>Sat down to one side, and respectfully</p>
<p>Praised the Leader:</p>
<p>“ ‘The things taught in mantras</p>
<p>Lie precisely in you.</p>
<p>You are undoubtedly the Buddha,</p>
<p>The world’s supreme teacher.</p>
<p>“ ‘You are Brahmā. You are Śakra.</p>
<p>There is no one surpassing you.</p>
<p>You are the sun. You are Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>You are the supreme one in the world.</p>
<p>“ ‘O Victor, no one like you has ever been seen,</p>
<p>Nor has one surpassing you, needless to say.</p>
<p>In the world including the gods,</p>
<p>You are the victor who overwhelms Māra.</p>
<p>“ ‘You are the resting place for masterless ones</p>
<p>And also the refuge of those without support.</p>
<p>I will become your disciple.</p>
<p>May you become my refuge!’</p>
<p>“He then stretched out his hand,</p>
<p>Which looked like a golden pillar.</p>
<p>The Victor’s hand descended,</p>
<p>And my head was anointed with ointment.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘Since your mind was filled with faith,</p>
<p>You generated much merit.</p>
<p>The benefit for those whose minds are pure</p>
<p>Will not be small.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You have approached</p>
<p>The supreme field of merit, the Buddha.</p>
<p>You, son of a brahmin, have engaged in veneration.</p>
<p>Seeds have been sown in the excellent field.</p>
<p>“ ‘Since you have destroyed the path to inferior states of existence,</p>
<p>You need not fear such inferior modes of existence.</p>
<p>You, son of a brahmin, should open</p>
<p>The gate of immortality without a doubt.</p>
<p>“ ‘If you wish to go forth,</p>
<p>You should quickly remove your hair</p>
<p>And go forth in my presence.</p>
<p>Brahmin, be free from coarseness.’</p>
<p>“I was pleased with the nature of the Dharma.</p>
<p>There, my disciples said,</p>
<p>‘Why are you becoming a shaven-headed śramaṇa</p>
<p>When you were born a brahmin?</p>
<p>“ ‘Are you abandoning this white family lineage</p>
<p>And choosing that dark family lineage?</p>
<p>In this world, brahmins are masters,</p>
<p>Perfect ones, ones who were born</p>
<p>From the heart and mouth of Brahmā.</p>
<p>Brahmins were produced by Brahmā.’</p>
<p>“I said, ‘You are all unintelligent.</p>
<p>You are all ignorant.</p>
<p>Here, only I know the nature of mantras</p>
<p>And am perfect.</p>
<p>“ ‘I will do just</p>
<p>As I understand the words</p>
<p>Of the one whose wisdom is limitless.</p>
<p>Those who do not wish to go there</p>
<p>“ ‘Can go anywhere</p>
<p>They would like.</p>
<p>I do not seek mantras</p>
<p>Or take them as an authority.’</p>
<p>“Then my disciples,</p>
<p>Choking with tears,</p>
<p>Addressed me in piteous voices</p>
<p>And then left in every direction.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the Muni,</p>
<p>Who possesses great compassion,</p>
<p>Spoke to me: ‘Come, monk,’</p>
<p>And I was ordained.</p>
<p>“I went forth with true faith</p>
<p>From my home into homelessness.</p>
<p>Having understood what the Buddha taught,</p>
<p>I accomplished all kinds of superhuman knowledge.</p>
<p>“I recalled my past lives.</p>
<p>I purified my divine sight.</p>
<p>I realized my death and rebirth—</p>
<p>Where I was in the past.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in exhausting impurities,</p>
<p>I realized magical power.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Hetu</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-second section: The Section of Hetu.</p>
<p>3. Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Kauṇḍinya, “O Venerable Kauṇḍinya, the venerable Hetu has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Kauṇḍinya, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Kauṇḍinya did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Once when the true Dharma</p>
<p>Of the great Muni Kāśyapa had declined,</p>
<p>All his disciples met together</p>
<p>And said to each other,</p>
<p>“ ‘Because of the nirvāṇa</p>
<p>Of the compassionate teacher Kāśyapa,</p>
<p>Certainly the number of mendicants will decrease,</p>
<p>And the true Dharma will no longer be taught.</p>
<p>“ ‘Let us demonstrate to each other</p>
<p>The Dharma as we have heard it,</p>
<p>Encourage ourselves in the Buddha’s teachings,</p>
<p>And continue exerting ourselves.’</p>
<p>“They climbed a mountain</p>
<p>And, saying, ‘For the time being, we will not rise from here</p>
<p>Until we have exhausted our defilements,’</p>
<p>Sat down on clean grass mats.</p>
<p>“When they were exerting themselves</p>
<p>Without regard for their lives,</p>
<p>Six attained supernormal knowledge,</p>
<p>And those monks were emancipated.</p>
<p>“I was the seventh.</p>
<p>Of dull faculties and less merit,</p>
<p>I died as an ordinary man,</p>
<p>In spite of my tireless exertions.</p>
<p>“As I thus kept endeavoring</p>
<p>Without giving up my efforts,</p>
<p>I was born in the world</p>
<p>Of the gods of the Tuṣita heaven.</p>
<p>“There I saw the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>The Great Muni, the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>The Muni preached</p>
<p>The inspiring Dharma to the gods.</p>
<p>“Having heard his Dharma preached,</p>
<p>I became attentive</p>
<p>And never gave up</p>
<p>Concentrating the mind on the true Dharma.</p>
<p>“After I left the world of the gods,</p>
<p>I was born in a city called Kapilavastu,</p>
<p>Among the Kauṇḍinyas,</p>
<p>Who belong to the brahmin race.</p>
<p>“The Bodhisattva, renowned</p>
<p>As the son of Śuddhodana,</p>
<p>Left his home out of faith</p>
<p>And became an ascetic. At that time,</p>
<p>“Śuddhodana, the best of kings,</p>
<p>Summoned me and exhorted me,</p>
<p>‘May you wish to go forth</p>
<p>And take care of him!’</p>
<p>“Then, with a pure mind,</p>
<p>I attended on the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>But he left after this thought came to his mind:</p>
<p>‘This path does not lead to purity.’</p>
<p>“When Śākyamuni</p>
<p>Turned the wheel of the Dharma,</p>
<p>I was the first</p>
<p>To understand the true Dharma.</p>
<p>“I led the pure life</p>
<p>In Kāśyapa’s dispensation.</p>
<p>I pleased the Buddha</p>
<p>And succeeded in exhausting impurities.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-third section: The Section of Kauṇḍinya.</p>
<p>4. Upālin</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Upālin, “O Venerable Upālin, the venerable Kauṇḍinya has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Upālin, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Upālin did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“In a past life,</p>
<p>In the royal palace in Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>I was the barber</p>
<p>Of a king named Brahmadatta.</p>
<p>“I used to cut and arrange</p>
<p>His hair and beard,</p>
<p>And perfume his clothes.</p>
<p>This delighted me.</p>
<p>“I attended on the king</p>
<p>With a respectful, affectionate mind.</p>
<p>Satisfied, then, I chanted verses there,</p>
<p>Which had never been heard before:</p>
<p>“ ‘Objects of desire are useless,</p>
<p>Roots of evil, roots of sorrow.</p>
<p>The maturation of karma is severe.</p>
<p>“ ‘If a young brahmin,</p>
<p>Rejecting the qualities of desire,</p>
<p>Succeeds in going forth, he will have attained a boon.’</p>
<p>“Having heard these verses that had never been heard,</p>
<p>He was then moved.</p>
<p>I said, ‘May you, O King, allow me</p>
<p>To go forth into homelessness!’</p>
<p>“The king then said to me,</p>
<p>‘If you go forth,</p>
<p>You should promise</p>
<p>To meet me again later.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Victorious One, I swear to you</p>
<p>I will do just as you have ordered.</p>
<p>After going forth,</p>
<p>I will meet you again. Trust me.’</p>
<p>“Then the king allowed it,</p>
<p>And I went to a forest in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I approached a master</p>
<p>And went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“Having properly gone forth,</p>
<p>I practiced the</p>
<p>Four immeasurable pure abodes,</p>
<p>And succeeded in freeing myself from desire.</p>
<p>“During that king’s reign,</p>
<p>I, whose name was Gaṅgāpāla,</p>
<p>Was venerated by the people</p>
<p>As one possessed of great majesty and power.</p>
<p>“Having gone to the master,</p>
<p>Bowed to him,</p>
<p>And sat down to one side,</p>
<p>I spoke these words:</p>
<p>“ ‘Teacher, please listen to my words.</p>
<p>I have made a promise</p>
<p>To the master of the people, Brahmadatta,</p>
<p>To meet him again.’</p>
<p>“ ‘You are allowed, O brahmin,</p>
<p>To go to the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>Carry out your promise</p>
<p>So that you will not be a liar.</p>
<p>“ ‘You go, for you are allowed to.</p>
<p>In accordance with my words,</p>
<p>Go from here and make the master of the people,</p>
<p>Brahmadatta, increase his faith.’</p>
<p>“Having been allowed by the master,</p>
<p>And having circumambulated the ṛṣi,</p>
<p>I went in due course</p>
<p>To the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“When Brahmadatta heard</p>
<p>That I had arrived there,</p>
<p>He came to me,</p>
<p>Displaying great royal wealth.</p>
<p>“Having alighted from the carriage,</p>
<p>He bowed low until his forehead touched my feet,</p>
<p>And then he sat down to one side.</p>
<p>I preached to him the Dharma</p>
<p>For being liberated from desires.</p>
<p>“Having heard it, the king was delighted</p>
<p>And quit seeking the objects of desire.</p>
<p>“With vast joy,</p>
<p>Brahmadatta thus said,</p>
<p>‘I too will go forth,</p>
<p>For I am not a seeker after the objects of desire.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O King, come! Depart for solitary</p>
<p>Forests in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Depart to approach</p>
<p>A brahmin, a ṛṣi, a master.’</p>
<p>“The king put his eldest son,</p>
<p>Who was free from fear, upon the throne.</p>
<p>Having relinquished his throne, this most excellent king</p>
<p>Went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>“Surrounded by his family, ministers,</p>
<p>All the citizens</p>
<p>And his relatives,</p>
<p>He left to go forth.</p>
<p>“When he arrived in front of the master,</p>
<p>The king bowed</p>
<p>And made the gesture of supplication,</p>
<p>And asked permission to go forth.</p>
<p>“Together with hundreds of thousands of people,</p>
<p>He went forth into homelessness.</p>
<p>Having shaved off his hair and beard,</p>
<p>He donned saffron robes.</p>
<p>“The master, whose mind was well adjusted,</p>
<p>Fully preached the Dharma</p>
<p>On the four pure abodes,</p>
<p>Which leads to birth in the world of Brahmā.</p>
<p>“I attended on the king</p>
<p>With a respectful, affectionate mind.</p>
<p>Thereupon I died</p>
<p>And went to the Clear Light Heaven.</p>
<p>“After dying in the Clear Light Heaven,</p>
<p>I came back here again,</p>
<p>And wherever I was born</p>
<p>I was wealthy and possessed much property.</p>
<p>“I experienced much of the happiness</p>
<p>Of gods and humans.</p>
<p>At this final time,</p>
<p>In my final body,</p>
<p>“I was born in a city called Kapilavastu</p>
<p>In the country of the Śākyans.</p>
<p>I was a barber of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>Who had vast land and abundant wealth.</p>
<p>“I attended on the Śākyan son, who was naturally compassionate,</p>
<p>And his disciples.</p>
<p>Displaying the wealth of great kings,</p>
<p>They departed to go forth.</p>
<p>“Having shaved their hair,</p>
<p>I spoke these words:</p>
<p>‘If my lords do not give me a means of livelihood,</p>
<p>How can I make my living?’</p>
<p>“They gave me their accessories</p>
<p>And clothes they had worn,</p>
<p>Saying, with pleasure,</p>
<p>‘These are your means of livelihood.’</p>
<p>“Having thought about the many treasures,</p>
<p>I was agitated there:</p>
<p>‘I will relinquish all of these</p>
<p>And ask for permission to go forth.</p>
<p>“ ‘What use are such treasures</p>
<p>For me, one who is poor?</p>
<p>If someone hears of this,</p>
<p>He will certainly kill me.</p>
<p>“ ‘Having tied my tools</p>
<p>Around a tree</p>
<p>And abandoned them,</p>
<p>I should surely leave my house and depart.</p>
<p>“ ‘I am not a seeker after treasures.</p>
<p>I too should go forth.’</p>
<p>Having heard these words of mine,</p>
<p>The king of the Śākyans said,</p>
<p>“ ‘You will be the first to go forth</p>
<p>And so you will be the eldest.’</p>
<p>With compassionate consideration,</p>
<p>The Buddha said to me, ‘Come, monk.’</p>
<p>“I was the first to go forth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the royal family members went forth</p>
<p>And bowed to my feet.</p>
<p>Thus the Śākyans removed their haughtiness.</p>
<p>“Thus I went forth.</p>
<p>I achieved the six kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>As an arhat possessed of the six kinds of supernormal knowledge,</p>
<p>I perfected myself in the Vinaya.</p>
<p>“I was praised by the Teacher himself</p>
<p>As the best of Vinaya holders.”</p>
<p>Thus, seated before the community of monks,</p>
<p>Upālin explained his karma</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-fourth section: The Section of Upālin.</p>
<p>5. Prabhākara</p>
<p>Thereupon the Protector of the World</p>
<p>Said to the Elder Prabhākara,</p>
<p>“Explain the karma</p>
<p>You created in the past.”</p>
<p>“Having heard the Victor’s words,</p>
<p>I will relate the karma I remember</p>
<p>Creating in a past time,</p>
<p>In the Muni’s presence.</p>
<p>“The stūpa of the Buddha Padmottara,</p>
<p>Master and protector of the world,</p>
<p>Stood in a forest,</p>
<p>Surrounded by harmful beasts.</p>
<p>“There was no one</p>
<p>Capable of worshiping the stūpa.</p>
<p>Those people did not understand</p>
<p>Either merit or sin.</p>
<p>“I went there, removed</p>
<p>Trees and grass,</p>
<p>Then took a broom</p>
<p>And cleaned everything.</p>
<p>“Having circumambulated it eight times,</p>
<p>And worshiped and venerated it, I went home.</p>
<p>Because of this root of merit,</p>
<p>I was born among the gods.</p>
<p>“Rich with every object of desire,</p>
<p>I enjoyed myself among the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>
<p>In the divine realm, I reigned</p>
<p>Over that divine kingdom thirty-six times.</p>
<p>“There, my dwelling place</p>
<p>Was very bright with golden light</p>
<p>Thirty-six yojanas in width</p>
<p>And sixty yojanas in length.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I, as the master of the people,</p>
<p>Reigned over the masses seven times.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that the color of my body</p>
<p>Was as bright as gold.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I was born into either of two castes,</p>
<p>Namely, brahmin and kṣatriya.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I used to travel</p>
<p>In a palanquin, on an elephant’s back, and in the best vehicle.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that in my presence logs,</p>
<p>Thorns, and gravel moved aside by themselves.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I do not remember</p>
<p>Becoming sick even once.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that wherever I went,</p>
<p>There was an abundance of prosperity.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Victor’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I always behaved like a god,</p>
<p>And was served and venerated.</p>
<p>“Another wonder</p>
<p>Caused by cleaning the Protector’s stūpa</p>
<p>Was that I do not remember</p>
<p>Any illness attacking my body even once.</p>
<p>“Thus, the Buddha and his Dharma</p>
<p>Are taintless and inconceivable.</p>
<p>Having faith in inconceivable ones</p>
<p>Bears great fruit.</p>
<p>“Therefore, those who wish to exhaust old age and death</p>
<p>And desire perfection</p>
<p>Should offer supreme veneration</p>
<p>To a Victor’s stūpa.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the good deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>I have experienced its pleasant,</p>
<p>Desirable fruit, which causes happiness.”</p>
<p>Thus the monk Prabhākara</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-fifth section: The Section of Prabhākara.</p>
<p>6. Revata</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the venerable Revata, “O Venerable Revata, the venerable Prabhākara has explained his karmic bond. Now you, Venerable Revata, should also explain your karmic bond.”</p>
<p>Then the venerable Revata did explain his karmic bond:</p>
<p>“Ten million eons ago,</p>
<p>I performed a good deed</p>
<p>For the Buddha Sarvābhibhū.</p>
<p>I remember it, O honored ones.</p>
<p>“When, attended by</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of disciples,</p>
<p>That most excellent man went</p>
<p>To the incomparable royal capital,</p>
<p>“I also arrived there from another city</p>
<p>On some business.</p>
<p>I saw there the Completely Awakened One</p>
<p>With the supreme thirty-two marks,</p>
<p>“Appearing like fire, a jewel, lightning,</p>
<p>Sunlight, and moonlight.</p>
<p>Surpassing every kind of light,</p>
<p>The Buddha’s splendor was especially noble.</p>
<p>“Having seen the one whom I had never seen,</p>
<p>Whose splendor was like a ball of fire,</p>
<p>I asked a brahmin</p>
<p>Who was in front of me.</p>
<p>“Upon being asked, he said to me,</p>
<p>‘This is the Buddha, the Leader,</p>
<p>The best of gods and humans, the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>The supreme man.’</p>
<p>“Having heard the sound buddha,</p>
<p>I was then delighted—</p>
<p>Delighted and pleased,</p>
<p>I felt my entire body at peace</p>
<p>“And heard nonhumans playing</p>
<p>Various kinds of music of the divine realm.</p>
<p>Divine sandal powder, too,</p>
<p>Rained down on that most excellent city.</p>
<p>“Some scattered utpala and campa flowers,</p>
<p>Others flowers of the parūṣaka,</p>
<p>And others sandal powder.</p>
<p>“I made the gesture of supplication</p>
<p>And, pleased and delighted,</p>
<p>Soared up into the sky and stayed there.</p>
<p>My entire body</p>
<p>Was filled with joy and delight.</p>
<p>“I ran around</p>
<p>Seeking perfume and flowers,</p>
<p>But there were no flowers</p>
<p>Nearby me at that time.</p>
<p>“Then, just there,</p>
<p>I saw a parasol</p>
<p>As white as a conch shell</p>
<p>In a nearby parasol shop.</p>
<p>“Seeking the parasol,</p>
<p>I entreated them for it. When I received the parasol,</p>
<p>I raised it over the Buddha,</p>
<p>My mind filled with faith.</p>
<p>“The parasol left my hand</p>
<p>And soared up into the air.</p>
<p>It moved when the Teacher walked,</p>
<p>And it stopped when he stopped.</p>
<p>“From the sky, like a cloud,</p>
<p>It cast a shadow over the Buddha.</p>
<p>Not leaving the body of the Muni,</p>
<p>It remained in the air.</p>
<p>“When we observed these miracles,</p>
<p>I and other people</p>
<p>Respectfully made the gesture of supplication</p>
<p>And bowed to the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>“Then, having understood the marks</p>
<p>Of the Completely Awakened One and his disciples</p>
<p>And memorized them,</p>
<p>I accomplished my household work with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ah, I have profited well</p>
<p>To have seen the Buddha and remembered him!</p>
<p>I offered the parasol to the Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>Who possessed supreme good qualities.</p>
<p>“Because of that root of merit,</p>
<p>Which was my offering of a parasol</p>
<p>To the supreme field of merit,</p>
<p>I was endowed with the seven treasures.</p>
<p>“After that, I was born</p>
<p>Among the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>
<p>Having become the king of those gods,</p>
<p>I was venerated by ten million gods.</p>
<p>“When I returned to human life,</p>
<p>I became a king ruling through power,</p>
<p>Who possessed much wealth and great majesty</p>
<p>And was attended even by other kings.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this karma,</p>
<p>However many times I transmigrated,</p>
<p>The karma I created</p>
<p>Was never interrupted.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this good karma,</p>
<p>My offering in faith</p>
<p>To such a field of merit,</p>
<p>I do not remember going to any inferior state of existence.</p>
<p>“My final birth is</p>
<p>This human life I have attained.</p>
<p>I have pleased this caravan leader,</p>
<p>The Supremely, Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Having succeeded in going forth</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Lion of the Śākyans,</p>
<p>I attained nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>The peaceful state of an arhat.</p>
<p>“Māra, however, created a huge body</p>
<p>Like a mountain, as large as a yojana,</p>
<p>Like a cloud in the sky,</p>
<p>Which was ugly in color.</p>
<p>“Then he frightened me.</p>
<p>I wondered what it was</p>
<p>And immediately realized that</p>
<p>It was Māra, who does harm.</p>
<p>“ ‘Evil One, you have come here,</p>
<p>Having transformed at will</p>
<p>Your body like Mount Cakravāḍa</p>
<p>And your head like Mount Sumeru.</p>
<p>“ ‘I am an arhat, one who has become powerful,</p>
<p>A śramaṇa possessed of the threefold knowledge.</p>
<p>I have attained the peaceful state</p>
<p>Taught by the Buddha.’</p>
<p>“I sat still for seven days</p>
<p>With almsfood that was given just once,</p>
<p>And experienced the joy of liberation—</p>
<p>Thus I practiced.</p>
<p>“O honored ones, this is the good deed</p>
<p>That I remember performing.</p>
<p>I have experienced its pleasant,</p>
<p>Desirable fruit, which causes happiness.”</p>
<p>Thus the Elder Revata</p>
<p>Explained his karma,</p>
<p>Seated before the community of monks</p>
<p>On the great lake Anavatapta.</p>
<p>Here ends the thirty-sixth section: The Section of Revata.</p>
<p>7. The Sugata (prose)</p>
<p>After they had each finished explaining their karmic bonds, the monks who were the most venerable of the elders requested the Blessed One, “O Honored One, we have each explained our karmic bonds. It would be appropriate if the Blessed One would also explain his karmic bond.”</p>
<p>a. The Son of a Householder</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create so that he was injured on his big toe with a piece of stone while being the Buddha, who had perfectly accomplished awakening?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past, accruing a heap of karma . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once  there lived a certain householder in a certain hamlet. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves . . . . A boy was born and grew up. After the boy’s mother died, the householder took another wife and he and she played . . . . A boy was born to her, too.</p>
<p>“Then the householder arranged for a wife for his elder son. As they played, made love, and enjoyed themselves, they had many sons and daughters. Later, the householder and his wife died. The younger son went to see his brother. The wife asked, ‘My dear, this boy who has come to us, who is he to you?’</p>
<p>“ ‘He is my brother,’ he answered.</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, does he also have a right to a share of our family’s property?’</p>
<p>“ ‘He gets one half, and we the other half.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, while this one is single, why does he get one half, and we, who are many, the other half?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good lady, this is the law of the world.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, if this is so, kill him!’</p>
<p>“ ‘Good lady, how could it be right to kill a brother for the sake of property?’</p>
<p>“She insisted on this again and again. Since there is no evil act that those who follow desire cannot perform, he consented. He thought, ‘If I kill him in the village, many people will come to know about it. So, I will kill him in the wilderness.’</p>
<p>“He called his brother and said, ‘Brother, let us go into the wilderness to collect flowers and firewood.’</p>
<p>“He went to the wilderness with his brother, and then he beat him to death with a stone in a cave.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the son of the householder and killed his younger brother with a stone in the wilderness at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my beating my brother to death with a stone in the wilderness for the sake of wealth, I was boiled in the hells for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years,  hundreds of thousands of years. Because of the remains of that karma, I was injured on my big toe with a piece of stone, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>b. A Caravan Leader</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause the Blessed One to be injured on his foot with a piece of khadira wood?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past, accruing a heap of karma . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there were two caravan leaders. Each of them prepared a ship and took to the great ocean, seeking to gain wealth, and because of a tailwind they quickly arrived at an island of jewels. One of them carefully filled his ship with jewels, and the other carelessly. After both of them departed, the carelessly loaded ship sank. The one whose ship had sunk implored the other, ‘Let me aboard, please!’</p>
<p>“The other weighed him on scales, threw away some of the jewels, and brought him onto the large ship.</p>
<p>“After getting on, he thought, ‘It is nonsense that while he is returning with gains, I have no gains. I will make a hole in his ship.’</p>
<p>“When he secretly and slowly began to make a hole, the other caravan leader came to know about it and said, ‘O caravan leader, do not make a hole in the ship. Otherwise, everyone will suffer misfortune.’</p>
<p>“Unable to stop him, whose mind was possessed with jealousy, he killed him with a short spear.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That caravan leader who killed the other caravan leader at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my killing the caravan leader with a short spear, I was boiled in the hells for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years,  hundreds of thousands of years. Because of the remains of that karma, I was injured on my foot with a piece of khadira wood, even though I had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>c. A Young Brahmin</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him, after entering Sālā village with his washed bowl, to return with his bowl just as it was, without obtaining even a bit of food?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past, accruing a heap of karma. . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there lived a young brahmin in the city of Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear, there appear self-awakened ones as the only fields of merit in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with sitting in places on the outskirts of a town. At that time, a self-awakened one named Conqueror of Defilements had appeared in the world. He stayed in Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near the city of Vārāṇasī. He dressed early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Vārāṇasī for alms. A certain young brahmin also entered a certain house for alms, but he came out without obtaining any food. The self-awakened one, free from defilements, entered the house for alms. The young brahmin saw him enter and thought, ‘I will see what this mendicant does.’</p>
<p>“He turned around, followed him, and stayed behind the door. The wife of the householder saw the self-awakened one, whose body was beautiful, whose mind was pure. Faith having arisen in her, she filled his bowl with a pure and fine meal. When he came out, carrying it, the young brahmin saw him and said, ‘Hey, mendicant,  let me have a look at what almsfood you got!’</p>
<p>As his knowledge did not function when he was not particularly attentive, the self-awakened one showed him the food. Then the young brahmin, whose mind was possessed with jealousy, slapped his hand. The bowl fell down and the food scattered on the ground. The young brahmin trampled on it. The self-awakened one said to him, ‘Sir, why do you waste food? If you had asked, I would have given it to you.’</p>
<p>“Having slandered the self-awakened one a great deal, the young brahmin turned around, stalked off to Ṛṣivadana Deer Park, and stayed there.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the brahmin at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my obstructing the meal of the self-awakened one with my mind possessed by jealousy, I was boiled in the hells for many years . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I was now obstructed from getting a meal in Sālā village, even though I had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>d. Bharadvāja</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to be falsely slandered by the female wandering mendicant Sundarikā?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past, accruing a heap of karma . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once when the human lifespan was eighty thousand years, two brothers went forth in the dispensation of the Completely Awakened One Vipaśyin . . . a buddha, a blessed one. They were called Vasiṣṭha and Bharadvāja.</p>
<p>“Exerting himself, endeavoring, and striving, Vasiṣṭha abandoned all the defilements  and actualized the state of an arhat. Bharadvāja too, through recitation and repetition, became well versed in the three divisions of the canon, as well as in eloquence joined to reason, and also became free from obstacles.</p>
<p>“One day, Bharadvāja persuaded a householder to build him a monastery provided with all kinds of necessities. Then he sent a message to his brother, Vasiṣṭha: ‘Let us live together. Please come.’</p>
<p>“Upon hearing this, the brother did come. When the householder saw him, whose behavior was calm, whose body was beautiful, and whose mind was pure, the householder was filled with faith. Faith having arisen in him, he satisfied Vasiṣṭha with good food, and dressed him in a set of robes that fit the great man. Then Bharadvāja felt jealousy and thought, ‘I must have priority before any others for this householder. But, whereas I have never been given any cloth by him, Vasiṣṭha was dressed in a set of robes as soon as he came here.’ He began to find fault with his brother, Vasiṣṭha. The brother noticed this and thought, ‘Since he has a jealous nature, if I do not give him this set of robes, he will just be more unpleasant.’</p>
<p>“He gave them to Bharadvāja. However, Bharadvāja still indulged himself in finding fault with him. A servant girl of the householder used to go to the monastery and clean it. Bharadvāja said to her, ‘Girl, I will give you this set of robes. So, you do as I tell you.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O noble one, what should I do?’ she asked.</p>
<p>“ ‘You should wear this set of robes of mine and clean the house,’ he replied. ‘If the householder asks you, “Where did this set of robes of yours come from?” answer, “The noble one Vasiṣṭha gave them to me.” If he asks why, answer, “O master, are you asking why men give things to women?” ’</p>
<p>“She did everything as she was instructed. Then the householder lost faith in Vasiṣṭha. As those great men were concerned about disrespectful acts, he stood up and left.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was Bharadvāja at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my falsely slandering an arhat, I was boiled in the hells for many years . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I now was falsely slandered by the female wandering mendicant Sundarikā, even though I had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>e. The Cause of the False Slander by Cañcā</p>
<p>I) A Brahmin</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to be falsely slandered by the brahmin girl Cañcā?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the shared and unshared actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past, accruing a heap of karma . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“What is shared? Monks, once in Vārāṇasī, a brahmin who had mastered the Vedas and the auxiliary branches of the Vedas was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins. He was looked up to, esteemed, venerated, and paid homage to as a worthy man by the people living in Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“One day, a ṛṣi who possessed the five kinds of supernormal knowledge, having traveled through the country, arrived in Vārāṇasī. When the people living in Vārāṇasī saw him, whose body was beautiful, whose mind was pure, all of them were filled with faith and gave donations to him, performed service for him, or did anything for him that would be beneficial for their next life.  Then the benefit and honor the brahmin was used to enjoying decreased. He felt jealousy toward the ṛṣi. His mind possessed with that jealousy, he said to the young brahmins, ‘Young brahmins, this is not a ṛṣi but an enjoyer of objects of desire.’</p>
<p>“ ‘True, sir!’ they replied. ‘This is an enjoyer of objects of desire, not a ṛṣi.’</p>
<p>“Then they broadcast in wide streets, in markets, at crossroads and at three-forked roads, in houses of brahmins and householders: ‘This is not a ṛṣi but an enjoyer of objects of desire!’</p>
<p>“Many people lost faith. Concerned about disrespectful acts, the ṛṣi left Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the brahmin at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Those who were the five hundred young brahmins were indeed these five hundred monks. Because of the maturation of the karma, namely, my falsely slandering the ṛṣi, I was boiled in hells . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I was falsely slandered along with the five hundred monks by the brahmin girl Cañcā, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening. This is called shared.”</p>
<p>II) Mṛṇāla</p>
<p>“What is unshared?  Monks, once in the city of Vārāṇasī, a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country, which was rich . . . .  At that time there was a courtesan named Bhadrā and a rogue named Mṛṇāla. He sent her garments and accessories for the purpose of enjoying himself with her. Wearing these garments and accessories, when she was about to depart, another man brought five hundred kārṣāpaṇa and said, ‘Bhadrā, let us enjoy ourselves.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If I go,’ she thought, ‘I cannot obtain the five hundred kārṣāpaṇa. Moreover, it would be rude if I left, refusing someone who came to my house.’</p>
<p>“She said to her servant girl, ‘Go and say to Mṛṇāla, “My mistress said, ‘For the time being,  I am not ready. So, I will come later.’ ” ’ The girl went to him and repeated this.</p>
<p>“As the other man was a busy person, he left in the evening after having enjoyed himself with Bhadrā. She thought, ‘Since I have plenty of time, I can obey the wishes of that first man, too.’</p>
<p>“She again said to the girl, ‘Go and say to Mṛṇāla, “My mistress said, ‘I am ready. Which park should I come to?’ ” ’</p>
<p>“The girl went to him and repeated this. He said, ‘Your mistress is not ready at one moment, and then at the next moment she is.’</p>
<p>“As the girl was not on good terms with Bhadrā, she said, ‘Sir, she was not unready but was enjoying herself with another man, wearing the garments and accessories from you.’</p>
<p>“Although he had been filled with desire, it vanished, and now he was filled with malice. Unable to bear it, he said, ‘Girl, go to Bhadrā and say, “Mṛṇāla said you should come to such-and-such a park.” ’</p>
<p>“She went and repeated this to Bhadrā. Then Bhadrā went to the park. The rogue Mṛṇāla asked, ‘Is it reasonable of you to enjoy yourself with another man, wearing the garments and accessories from me?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Sir, this is my fault,’ she replied. ‘But please forgive me, for women  always make mistakes.’</p>
<p>“Unable to bear it, however, he took a sword from its sheath and killed her. Then the girl cried out loudly, ‘Mistress has been killed! Mistress has been killed!’ Many people heard her and rushed there. At that time, a self-awakened one named Suruci was practicing dhyāna in that park. Then the rogue Mṛṇāla, frightened, threw the bloody sword in front of the self-awakened one Suruci and slipped in among the crowd. The many people saw the bloody sword and shouted, ‘This mendicant killed Bhadrā!’ Then they surrounded the self-awakened one and, unable to bear it, said, ‘Hey, mendicant, did you do such a thing while upholding the banner of a ṛṣi?’</p>
<p>“ ‘What did I do?’ he asked.</p>
<p>“ ‘You enjoyed yourself with Bhadrā and killed her,’ they told him.</p>
<p>“ ‘That is unbearable to hear!’ he exclaimed. ‘I did not do any such thing.’</p>
<p>“Although he said the word unbearable, the many people tied his hands tightly behind his back and turned him over to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this mendicant enjoyed himself with Bhadrā and killed her.’</p>
<p>“(Kings do not investigate things carefully.) He said, ‘If so, I have forsaken this mendicant. Kill him today.’</p>
<p>“His neck was then tied with a garland of karavīra, and he was surrounded by executioners dressed in blue clothes. They proclaimed the sentence in wide streets, in markets, at crossroads, and at three-forked roads, and, having left the city, they took him to the park. Then this thought occurred to the rogue Mṛṇāla: ‘Since I falsely slandered this faultless, innocent mendicant and ascetic,  he is now near his death. It would not be right for me to ignore him.’ He turned around, went to the king, threw himself at his feet, and said, ‘Your Majesty, this mendicant did not do this act. This evil act was done by me. Please release this mendicant.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the rogue Mṛṇāla at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my falsely slandering the self-awakened one, I was boiled in the hells for many years . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I was now falsely slandered along with the five hundred monks by the brahmin girl Cañcā, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening. This is unshared.”</p>
<p>f. A Brahmin Who Falsely Accused a Buddha</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to eat rotten barley with four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya, while the venerables Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana ate divine food?”</p>
<p>“Monks,’ the Blessed One answered, ‘the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once when the human lifespan was eighty thousand years, there appeared in the world a teacher named Vipaśyin . . . a buddha, a blessed one. He arrived at the royal capital Bandhumatī with sixty thousand attendants, having traveled through the country.  A certain brahmin of Bandhumatī was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins. When he saw the Completely Awakened One Vipaśyin with his five hundred attendants, he said to the young brahmins, ‘Sirs, these shaven-headed śramaṇas deserve not to enjoy divine food, but to eat rotten barley.’</p>
<p>“They agreed with him: ‘True, sir! These shaven-headed śramaṇas deserve not divine food, but to eat rotten barley.’</p>
<p>“But two virtuous young brahmins remarked, ‘What the master said is not good. These great men deserve to enjoy divine food.’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the brahmin who had five hundred disciples at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my speaking harsh words against the Perfectly Awakened One Vipaśyin and his community of monks, I ate rotten barley for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. Because of the remains of that karma, I had rotten barley with four hundred ninety-eight monks in Vairambhya. Those who were the two young brahmins were indeed the monks Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana.”</p>
<p>g. Uttara</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to engage in ascetic practice for six years?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One answered, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there was a provincial town named Vaibhiḍiṅgī, which was rich, prosperous, peaceful, abundant in food, and full of many people.  In the provincial town of Vaibhiḍiṅgī there was a potter named Nandīpāla, who had faith in the Buddha and had faith in the Dharma and the Saṅgha; who sought refuge in the Buddha and sought refuge in the Dharma and the Saṅgha; who was devoted to the Buddha and devoted to the Dharma and the Saṅgha; who had no hesitancy or doubt about the Buddha and had no hesitancy or doubt about the Dharma and the Saṅgha; and who had no hesitancy or doubt about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path, had seen the truths, had attained the fruits of good karma, and had abandoned leaves and pestles. He did not dig soil by himself or make others do so, but used soil that was channeled by water or dug by mice. He used to take clay, stir it with water free from insects, make vessels, put them to one side, and say, ‘Masters, sirs, put some sesame, rice, mudga beans, or beans on one side here, and those of you who need a vessel should take one.’</p>
<p>“Doing this, he took care of his blind parents and often offered almsfood to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. He was also the friend and favorite of a young brahmin, Uttara, and was the same age as him.</p>
<p>“Monks, in the provincial town of Vaibhiḍiṅgī there was a very wealthy brahmin named Nyagrodha, who was rich and had great wealth and many possessions. He was enjoying all of Vaibhiḍiṅgī, which had been given by King Kṛkin along with tribute, grass, trees, and water as gifts for brahmins.  There was a disciple of the very wealthy brahmin Nyagrodha named Uttara, whose parents belonged to noble families; whose wife’s family was also pure; whose paternal and maternal lineages had not had any bad reputation for seven generations; who taught; who memorized mantras; who was versed in the three Vedas together with their glossary, the science of rituals, and the analysis of letters and the stories of past events, which is fifth; who made predictions; and who was well proportioned, pleasant to behold, and attractive. The very wealthy brahmin Nyagrodha was teaching brahmanical mantras to five hundred young brahmins, who were his disciples. He was also the friend and favorite of the potter Nandīpāla and was the same age as him.</p>
<p>“At a certain point the potter Nandīpāla went to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the potter Nandīpāla. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the potter Nandīpāla in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, he remained silent. Then the potter Nandīpāla rejoiced in and praised the words of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. He bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from his seat,  and departed.</p>
<p>“At that time, the young brahmin Uttara left Vaibhiḍiṅgī, riding an entirely white chariot pulled by mares, carrying a golden water jar with a handle, surrounded by young brahmins, followed by young brahmins, wishing to teach brahmins outside Vaibhiḍiṅgī. When the young brahmin Uttara saw the potter Nandīpāla from a distance, he said, ‘O gentle sir, Nandīpāla, where have you been up until now?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Uttara, gentle sir, I have gone to serve the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. O Uttara, gentle sir, come! Let us go to serve the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, stop serving the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. Where on earth in that shaven-headed śramaṇa could there be awakening? Awakening is very difficult to attain.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Uttara, gentle sir, you should not say, “Where on earth in that shaven-headed śramaṇa could there be awakening? Awakening is very difficult to attain.” None but that Blessed One is a buddha. He has realized every Dharma. O Uttara, gentle sir, come! Let us go to serve the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“The young brahmin Uttara said to the potter Nandīpāla a second and third time: ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, stop . . . . Awakening is very difficult to attain.’</p>
<p>“The potter Nandīpāla also said to the young brahmin Uttara a second and third time: ‘O Uttara, gentle sir, you should not say that . . . let us go to serve . . . .’</p>
<p>“Then the potter Nandīpāla  mounted the young brahmin Uttara’s chariot, grabbed the young brahmin Uttara by his hair, and said, ‘O Uttara, gentle sir, come! Let us go to serve the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“Then the young brahmin Uttara thought, ‘Ah, the Buddha is not unimportant; the Dharma and the Saṅgha are not unimportant. Thus, the potter Nandīpāla, who has never, for a long time now, been fierce, violent, rough, or rude, has grabbed me by my hair.’ He asked the potter Nandīpāla, ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, is it really so?’</p>
<p>“ ‘ ‘O gentle sir, it is really so.’ replied Nandīpāla.</p>
<p>“ ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, if so, release me. Let us go to serve the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon the potter Nandīpāla and the young brahmin Uttara rode the same chariot and went to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. Having gone as far as they could go by vehicle, they alighted from the vehicle, entered the park on foot, and went to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. The potter Nandīpāla bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and then he sat down to one side. The young brahmin Uttara made plenty of pleasant and joyful conversation, face to face with the Blessed One, and he too sat down to one side. The potter Nandīpāla then made the gesture of supplication and said to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, ‘O Honored One, this young brahmin Uttara does not have faith in the Buddha, nor does he have faith in the Dharma and Saṅgha.  May the Blessed One preach the Dharma so that this young brahmin Uttara develops faith in the Buddha, and does so also in the Dharma and Saṅgha!’</p>
<p>“Then the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the young brahmin Uttara. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the young brahmin Uttara in variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, he remained silent. Then the young brahmin Uttara said to the potter Nandīpāla, ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, why do you not go forth from your home into homelessness with true faith, having heard such Dharma and Vinaya?’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Uttara, gentle sir, do you not know that I am feeding my blind parents and often offering almsfood to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa? O Uttara, gentle sir, you go forth. I will not go forth for the time being.’</p>
<p>“Then the potter Nandīpāla said to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, ‘O Honored One, may the Blessed One, having compassion, let this young brahmin Uttara go forth and ordain him a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya!’</p>
<p>“The young brahmin Uttara then did go forth and was ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.</p>
<p>“Then the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, having let the young brahmin Uttara go forth and ordained him a monk,  and having stayed in Vaibhiḍiṅgī as long as he wished, traveled to Vārāṇasī. In due course, he arrived at Vārāṇasī.</p>
<p>“When King Kṛkin heard that the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, having traveled through Kāśi, had arrived in Vārāṇasī and was staying in Ṛṣivadana Deer Park near Vārāṇasī, he went to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. Upon his arrival, he bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and then he sat down to one side. When he had sat down to one side, the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Kṛkin. After he had instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Kṛkin in a variety of ways through talk consistent with the Dharma, he remained silent.  Then King Kṛkin rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, fell on his right knee, made the gesture of supplication to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and said to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, ‘May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“The Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa assented to King Kṛkin by remaining silent. Then King Kṛkin, knowing that the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the feet of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa,  rose from his seat, and departed. Thereupon King Kṛkin prepared a pure and fine meal during the night. After he rose at dawn, he prepared seats, set up a jeweled pitcher, and let the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa know the time by messenger: ‘O Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.’</p>
<p>“Then early that morning the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa dressed, took his bowl and his robe, and, surrounded by a group of monks, went to the dining hall of King Kṛkin, followed by the community of monks. When he arrived, he sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. King Kṛkin then knew that the community of monks headed by the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa had sat down in comfort, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal.  Having thus, with his own hands, served and satisfied them in a variety of ways with a pure and fine meal, knowing that the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, the king made a request before the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa: ‘May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of the requisites for three months, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, and my offer to build five hundred monasteries for the Blessed One, providing five hundred couches, stools, cushions, pillows, and square blankets,  and serving rice covered with leaves to the Blessed One and the community of monks.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, it is enough that you have gained faith.’</p>
<p>“King Kṛkin asked the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa a second and a third time, ‘May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer . . . .’</p>
<p>“The Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa answered King Kṛkin a second and a third time, ‘Great King, it is enough that you have gained faith.’</p>
<p>“Then King Kṛkin asked the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, ‘O Honored One, is there anyone else who serves the Blessed One like me?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, in your country, there is a town named Vaibhiḍiṅgī, and there lives a potter named Nandīpāla, who has faith in the Buddha . . . . He cares for his blind parents and often brings me almsfood.</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, I once stayed near the provincial town of Vaibhiḍiṅgī. I dressed early in the morning, took my bowl and my robe, and entered the provincial town of Vaibhiḍiṅgī for alms. Walking for alms in Vaibhiḍiṅgī, I went to the potter Nandīpāla’s house. At that time the potter Nandīpāla was away on some business. When I knocked softly on the gate crossbar, the parents of the potter Nandīpāla heard the gate crossbar being knocked.  When they heard it, they asked, “Which noble one, which gentleman, is knocking on the gate crossbar of the potter Nandīpāla?”</p>
<p>“ ‘I answered them, “I am the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa and am asking for almsfood.”</p>
<p>“ ‘ “O noble one, please come in,” the two of them said to me. “O sir, please come in. The one who would serve you is away. There is kulmāṣa in a pot and soup in a small pot. Please help yourself.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, I decided that it was the time of Kuru in the north and helped myself to the kulmāṣa in the pot and soup in the small pot. After that, the potter Nandīpāla came home. When he saw that these foods had been eaten, he asked his parents, “Father, Mother, who ate the kulmāṣa in the pot and soup in the small pot?”</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Nandīpāla,” they answered, “when you were away, we heard the gate crossbar being knocked. When we heard it, we asked, ‘Which noble one, which gentleman, is knocking on the gate crossbar of the potter Nandīpāla?’ He answered, ‘I am the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa and asking for almsfood.’ We said to him, ‘O noble one, please come in. O sir, please come in. The one who would serve you is away. There is kulmāṣa in a pot and soup in a small pot. Please help yourself.’ Then he ate those.”</p>
<p>“ ‘The potter Nandīpāla thought, “I have attained a great boon, for the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa felt at ease and relaxed at my house.”  Pleased and delighted, he spent seven days sitting with his legs crossed. For as long as half a month, joy did not leave his body, and he never had any problem in his body. By the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods, the kulmāṣa in the pot and the soup in the small pot remained for his parents for the seven days.</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, once when I spent the rainy-season retreat near the provincial town of Vaibhiḍiṅgī, the god who brings rain caused the first rain to fall on my monastery. At that time, the potter Nandīpāla’s workshop was roofed with new grass. I ordered the monks who were attending me, “Monks, you should roof my monastery with the roof of the potter Nandīpāla’s workshop today.”</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the monks to me. When they removed the roof from the potter Nandīpāla’s workshop, he was away on some business. When the potter Nandīpāla’s two parents heard the roof of the workshop being removed, they asked, “Which noble one, which gentleman, is removing the roof of the workshop?”</p>
<p>“ ‘They answered, “We are monks attending on the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. Since the god who brings rain caused the first rain to fall on the monastery of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, we are removing this and will roof the monastery with it.”</p>
<p>“ ‘The two of them replied, “The one who should serve you is away. Noble ones, take it.  Sirs, take it.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Then the monks, having removed the roof of the workshop, roofed my monastery. After that, the potter Nandīpāla came home and saw that the roof of the workshop had been removed. When he saw this, he asked his parents, “Father, Mother, who removed the roof of this workshop?”</p>
<p>“ ‘They answered, “When you were away, we heard the roof of the workshop being removed. When we heard this, we asked, ‘Which noble one, which gentleman, is removing the roof of the workshop?’ They answered, ‘We are monks attending on the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa. Since the god who brings rain caused the first rain to fall on the monastery of the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, we are removing this and will roof the monastery with it.’ We said to them, ‘The one who should serve you is away. Noble ones, take it. Sirs, take it.’ They then removed the roof of the workshop.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Then the potter Nandīpāla thought, “I have attained a great boon, for the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa felt at ease and relaxed at my house.” . . . he spent seven days . . . . By the awakened power of the buddhas and the divine power of the gods, not a drop of rain fell on the roof of the potter Nandīpāla’s parents’ workshop during the rainy-season retreat.</p>
<p>“ ‘Great King, you may be disappointed, thinking, “The Completely Awakened One did not assent to my offer of the requisites for three months, namely, robes, almsfood,  bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick.” However, Nandīpāla was not disappointed even when the roof of his workshop was removed.’</p>
<p>“ ‘O Honored One, the potter Nandīpāla attained a great boon, for the Blessed One felt at ease and relaxed at his house.’</p>
<p>“Then the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa celebrated the offering made by King Kṛkin with this appreciation:</p>
<p>“Agnihotra is the best of sacrifices.</p>
<p>The best of verses is Sāvitrī.</p>
<p>The best of humans is a king.</p>
<p>The ocean is the best of water bodies.</p>
<p>“The moon is chief among celestial bodies.</p>
<p>The sun is the sovereign among all lights.</p>
<p>Above, below, all around,</p>
<p>In all the modes of existence of beings,</p>
<p>In the world including its gods,</p>
<p>The best of those who speak is the Completely Awakened One.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted King Kṛkin through talk consistent with the Dharma, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>“As soon as the Blessed One left, King Kṛkin ordered a man, ‘My good man, go and fill five hundred carriages with rice covered with leaves. Then go to the potter Nandīpāla, give them to him, and say, ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, King Kṛkin has sent you these five hundred carriages filled with rice covered with leaves. Feed your blind parents with these, frequently offer almsfood to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and also satisfy yourself.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Certainly, Your Majesty,’ replied the man  to King Kṛkin. Having filled five hundred carriages with rice covered with leaves, he went to Nandīpāla. When he arrived, he said to the potter Nandīpāla, ‘O Nandīpāla, gentle sir, King Kṛkin has sent you these five hundred carriages filled with rice covered with leaves. Feed your blind parents with these, frequently offer almsfood to the Completely Awakened One Kāśyapa, and also satisfy yourself.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My good man,’ replied Nandīpāla, ‘King Kṛkin has many duties and many things to do, but I have few duties and few things to do.’ He did not accept them.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the young brahmin Uttara at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. I did slander the person, but not awakening itself. Because of the maturation of that karma, I did ascetic practice at the site of awakening for six years. If I had slandered awakening itself, I would have had to exhaust myself for awakening for another three incalculably long eons.”</p>
<p>h. A Physician</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to have an attack of diarrhea while being the Buddha, who had perfectly accomplished awakening?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there was a physician in a certain hamlet. A son of a householder there caught a disease. He called the physician and asked him what to do. The physician gave him medicine, and thus the patient’s health returned. However, the householder did not pay him the fee. The householder’s son caught a disease three times  and had his health restored by the physician three times, but the householder still did not pay him the fees. Thereupon, the physician, unable to bear it, thought in fierce anger, ‘Although I have treated this householder’s son three times, he has never paid me anything. Now, if by any chance the son catches a disease, I will give him a poison that will cause his intestines to be shredded into pieces and drop out.’</p>
<p>“Later, the householder’s son felt sick and became ill again. Feeling an unbearable anger, the physician gave him poison, and so his intestines were shredded into pieces and dropped out.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the physician at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my giving poison to the householder’s son out of malice, which caused his intestines to shredded into pieces and drop out, I was boiled in hells for many years . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I now have had an attack of diarrhea, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>i. The Son of a Fisherman</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to be attacked by a severe headache when the Śākyans were destroyed?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there lived five hundred fishermen near the bank of the Bandhumatī River. They caught two very large fish, which had come into the Bandhumatī and were sleeping. They thought, ‘If we kill these two, their flesh will go bad and become unfit for sale.’  So they bound the two fish to a large nail. Each time someone came to buy the meat, they cut a piece from the fish’s flesh and gave it. When their bodies were cut, the two fish cried out in pain in the innate voice common to them. There, a child of a certain fisherman felt pleased each time the two fish cried out when their flesh was cut.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the fisherman’s child at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my feeling pleased at killing fish, my head ached for many years . . . . Because of the remains of that karma, I was attacked by a severe headache when the Śākyans were destroyed, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening.”</p>
<p>j. A Wrestler</p>
<p>“O Honored One, what karma did the Blessed One create that matured to cause him to be attacked by a wind illness in his back?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by the Tathāgata himself in other lives in the past . . . </p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>“They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once a certain wrestler came to the royal capital, having defeated all the other wrestlers in the province. In the royal capital was the king’s wrestler, who was unrivaled in strength and bravery. The provincial wrestler came to compete with him in strength for the flag of victory. Those wrestlers used to know one another merely by clasping hands, and thus the king’s wrestler came to know that this provincial wrestler was stronger than himself. He said,  ‘Friend, my position has been inherited from my ancestors. Please let yourself be defeated, and only fame will be mine, while the flag will be yours.’</p>
<p>“He promised. The king’s wrestler defeated him. The latter intended to receive the flag, but the king’s wrestler said, ‘Friend, I am the type to always seek victory, whether by deceit or power, and so I deceived you. Why would I give you the flag?’</p>
<p>“The great man, who had conquered his pride, came to compete with the wrestler three times. The king’s wrestler again tried to deceive him: ‘Friend, what use is the flag to you? I have a youthful, unmarried sister. I will give her to you. So please let yourself be defeated.’</p>
<p>“His wife heard this deceitful offer and said, ‘My dear, would you consider what happened before?’</p>
<p>“Then the provincial wrestler, his pride increased by the wife, in fierce anger lifted up the king’s wrestler and threw him. Thus he died, his back broken.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who was that provincial wrestler at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, my breaking the king’s wrestler’s back out of malicious, fierce anger, I was boiled in the hells for many years—hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years. Because of the remains of that karma, I now was attacked by a wind illness in my back, even while being the Tathāgata, who had perfectly accomplished awakening.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>

<p>Who had done everything to be done—</p>
<p>Together with five hundred of them.</p>
<p>On the bank of the lake,</p>
<p>The best of speakers stayed.</p>
<p>Then the merciful, compassionate one,</p>
<p>Who benefits all beings,</p>
<p>Saw the lake</p>
<p>And said to the monks,</p>
<p>“I committed evil deeds;</p>
<p>Listen to these words of mine:</p>
<p>b. Mṛṇāla</p>
<p>“In a past life,</p>
<p>I was a rogue, Mṛṇāla.</p>
<p>After I slandered a faultless</p>
<p>self-awakened one named Suruci,</p>
<p>“Many people gathered</p>
<p>And tightly bound</p>
<p>The Muni, who was pleased with the good qualities of the Dharma,</p>
<p>And left the city.</p>
<p>“I saw the śramaṇa</p>
<p>Tightly bound and suffering.</p>
<p>Having pity on him,</p>
<p>I liberated him myself.</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>I was cast into the hells for a long time.</p>
<p>When I came again to the human world,</p>
<p>I suffered slander.</p>
<p>“After that, because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>Even in my final life,</p>
<p>Non-Buddhist ascetics, through Sundarikā,</p>
<p>Cast false slander on me.</p>
<p>c. A Brahmin</p>
<p>“Once when I, as a brahmin</p>
<p>Who memorized mantras and had learned much,</p>
<p>Was teaching mantras in a forest</p>
<p>To five hundred brahmins,</p>
<p>“A ṛṣi came there,</p>
<p>Who possessed the five kinds of supernormal knowledge and great magical power.</p>
<p>When I saw him treated with honor,</p>
<p>I slandered him, he who was faultless:</p>
<p>“ ‘This ṛṣi wallows in desire!’</p>
<p>Thus I spoke to the young brahmins;</p>
<p>The young brahmins</p>
<p>Were satisfied to hear my words.</p>
<p>“Thereupon, when the young brahmins</p>
<p>Begged for food in houses here and there,</p>
<p>They said to many people,</p>
<p>‘This ṛṣi wallows in desire!’</p>
<p>“Because of the maturation of that karma,</p>
<p>Together with five hundred monks</p>
<p>I suffered the slander</p>
<p>Cast by Sundarikā.</p>
<p>d. Bharadvāja</p>
<p>“As Vasiṣṭha, who was a disciple</p>
<p>Of the Buddha Sarvābhibhū,</p>
<p>I falsely cast slander</p>
<p>On that śramaṇa at that time.</p>
<p>“Since I had created this evil karma,</p>
<p>I went to dreadful inferior states of existence—</p>
<p>I was born in the hells</p>
<p>And experienced the pain of suffering.</p>
<p>“After that, because of the remains of that karma,</p>
<p>Here the brahmin girl Cañcā,</p>
<p>When people were meeting together,</p>
<p>Cast false slander on me.</p>

<p>“For the sake of property,</p>
<p>Having entered the mountains,</p>

<p>l. Conclusion</p>
<p>The best of all beings,</p>
<p>Having realized the best of Dharmas,</p>
<p>Explained to the best of assemblies</p>
<p>The evil karma he created.</p>
<p>The one who defeats all, who has attained power,</p>
<p>Sitting in the middle of the community of monks,</p>
<p>At the great lake Anavatapta,</p>
<p>Explained his karma.</p>
<p>Here ends the Section of the Tathāgata.</p>
<p>Summary of Contents:</p>
<p>Madhuvāsiṣṭha, Hetu, Kauṇḍinya, Upālin,</p>
<p>Prabhākara, Revata, and the Sugata, who is the last.</p>
<p>Here end the Verses of Anavatapta.</p>
<p>G. The Invitation by Viśākhā</p>
<p>Thereupon, after having explained his karmic bonds together with the five hundred arhats at the great lake Anavatapta, the Blessed One disappeared from Lake Anavatapta and stayed in the palace in the former Park of Mṛgāramātā near Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā heard that the Blessed One, having disappeared from the great lake Anavatapta, had come to Śrāvastī and was staying in her palace near Śrāvastī, she left Śrāvastī and went to the Blessed One . . . . Having . . . delighted her, the Blessed One remained silent. Then Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā rose from her seat, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One with the five hundred arhats who explained their karmic bonds at the great lake Anavatapta assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā, knowing that he had assented . . . . Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged,  and delighted Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā, and then rose from his seat and left. He arrived at the monastery and sat on the seat prepared for him in the middle of the community of monks. When he had sat down, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, what Viśākhā Mṛgāramātā did is incomplete. Although she invited the community of monks and offered it a meal, she did not present any gift to the community.”</p>
<p>XII. Nagarabindu</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kosala, arrived at Nagarabindu and stayed in a śiṃśapā forest to the north of Nagarabindu. When the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu heard that the Blessed One had arrived . . . in the country of Kosala and was staying in a śiṃśapā forest, they met together, flocked together, left Nagarabindu, and went to the Blessed One. When they had arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s . . . . Having . . . delighted them, the Blessed One remained silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu rose from their seats, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at our house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu by remaining silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence.</p>
<p>Thereupon five hundred hungry ghosts who were just like raised skeletons and covered with their own hair, whose bellies were just like mountains, whose mouths were just like pinholes, andwho were burning—thoroughly burning, burning entirely throughout—turned into a single flame and approached the Blessed One. When they arrived, they sat down, surrounding the Blessed One, and said, “O Blessed One, these brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu were our relatives. Ah, may the Blessed One have compassion and assign the rewards of the offerings to our names.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One answered them, “I promise that if you appear in such shapes when I assign the rewards of the offerings, I will do it in your names.”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, we are ashamed,” they replied. “How could we appear in such a way?”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One spoke some verses:</p>
<p>“One is ashamed of what is not to be ashamed of,</p>
<p>But is not ashamed of what is to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>One fears what is not to fear,</p>
<p>But does not fear what is to fear.</p>
<p>Accepting wrong views,</p>
<p>Beings go to inferior modes of existence.</p>
<p>“One is ashamed of what is to be ashamed of,</p>
<p>But is not ashamed of what is not to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>One fears what is to fear,</p>
<p>But does not fear what is not to fear.</p>
<p>Accepting right views,</p>
<p>Beings go to superior modes of life.”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, if that is the case, we will come,” they promised.</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . took low seats, and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then those five hundred hungry ghosts appeared.  At the sight of the hungry ghosts, the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu began to run away. “Sirs, why do you run away?” the Blessed One asked them.</p>
<p>“O Blessed One,” they answered, “these hungry ghosts have come.”</p>
<p>“Come,” said the Blessed One. “These are your relatives. If you consent, I will assign the rewards of the offerings to their names.”</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, that would be agreeable,” they replied.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to their names in a voice that had five good qualities:</p>
<p>“The merit of this offering</p>
<p>Should accompany the hungry ghosts.</p>
<p>They should soon ascend</p>
<p>From the dreadful world of hungry ghosts.</p>
<p>“By this, may a variety of clothes, drink, food,</p>
<p>And bedding and seats</p>
<p>Be always with them,</p>
<p>Never running out.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu, rose from his seat, and departed.</p>
<p>Then the brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu met together in a meeting hall and started the following conversation: “The śramaṇa Gautama is greedy, and so are his disciples.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” said others, “the śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples. The non-Buddhist ascetics are not like them.”</p>
<p>At that time, a brahmin named Vairaṭṭasiṃha was attending the meeting. The brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha said to the other brahmins and householders in Nagarabindu,  “I will prove to you whether the śramaṇa Gautama is greedy or not, and whether his disciples are greedy or not.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “May the Honorable Gautama with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal of guḍa.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha by remaining silent. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, departed from the Blessed One’s presence. Thereupon the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, since the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha, who finds fault with us, has invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal of guḍa, you should take only as much food as you can eat, and no more.”</p>
<p>The brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha possessed five hundred guḍa-selling houses. He took a pan of guḍa from each guḍa house, and went to the Blessed One, bringing five hundred pans of guḍa. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honorable Gautama, the guḍa is ready. Please sit down with the community of monks and eat.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One washed his hands and bowl and sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha took a pan and began to distribute the guḍa, the Blessed One exercised his magical power so that the food fully remained even after it had been distributed among the entire community of monks. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha  was filled with faith. Filled with faith, he then spoke out everywhere: “Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples!”</p>
<p>Thereupon he invited non-Buddhist ascetics to have guḍa. After they had received the guḍa in a careless manner, some ate it, and some filled pans and took them away, spilling the guḍa everywhere. Then the brahmin Vairaṭṭasiṃha said, “Foolish ones, none but you are greedy. The śramaṇa Gautama is not greedy, and neither are his disciples.”</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, his faith in the Blessed One increased more and more and he went to the Blessed One. When he arrived . . . with the Blessed One . . . and said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I wish . . . in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life . . . .”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, by saying “Come, monk,” said, “Come, monk, lead the pure life.”</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>And his body swathed in the Buddha’s mind.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to the monks, “Therefore, I authorize you to eat guḍa at the time for the meal and at other times, whether you are sick or not. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>The venerable Vairaṭṭasiṃha was not able to attain concentration of mind because of the foul odor from a decomposed body. The Blessed One wondered, “Why does the monk Vairaṭṭasiṃha not see the truth while he is in his final life?” He then realized that it was due to the foul odor from a decomposed body. The Blessed One  then ordered the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and scatter perfume, garlands, incense smoke, and incense powder in Vairaṭṭasiṃha’s monastery, perfume his bedding and seat with incense smoke, and set up a flower parasol decorated with fragrant flowers.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. He went to Vairaṭṭasiṃha’s monastery while he was walking for alms and did everything as instructed by the Blessed One.</p>
<p>When he finished begging for alms, the venerable Vairaṭṭasiṃha returned to the monastery and saw the divine splendor. Then he ate the almsfood with his mind delighted. When he finished his meal, he washed his feet outside the monastery, entered the monastery, sat with his legs crossed, stretched his back, and focused his mind on a point in front of himself. As he smelled the sweet fragrance, his mind became concentrated. Then he abandoned all defilements and realized the state of an arhat . . . and he became an object of . . . praise.</p>
<p>Just then the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, the best of my monks, my disciples, for being liberated through what is attractive is this monk Vairaṭṭasiṃha.”</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that whereas other monks were liberated through what was unattractive, the venerable Vairaṭṭasiṃha was liberated through what was attractive?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “he would die among the Thirty-Three Gods and was always reborn into the same place for five hundred lives. He now  has been born among humans in his final life. He was not able to attain concentration of mind as he smelled a decomposed body. When he smelled the sweet fragrance, he was able to attain concentration of mind and thus was liberated through what was attractive. If this means had not been devised for him, he would not have attained even the stage of warmth. Therefore, I authorize those who will be liberated through such attractive things to follow this precedent. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>XIII. Vaiśālī</p>
<p>A. The Invitation by Dhanika and His Family</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived at Vaiśālī and stayed in Kūṭāgāraśālā on the bank of Markaṭa Pond near Vaiśālī.</p>
<p>When the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, had arrived at Vaiśālī, and was staying in Kūṭāgāraśālā on the bank of Markaṭa Pond near Vaiśālī, they met together and said, “Sirs, we have heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, has arrived at Vaiśālī and is staying in Kūṭāgāraśālā on the bank of Markaṭa Pond near Vaiśālī. If each of us invites the Blessed One for a meal, some will not have any opportunity to do so as the Blessed One will soon leave. Let’s make an agreement about this, so that everyone will offer a meal to the Blessed One together and no one will do so by himself.” Thus, they made such an agreement. At that time, there were four people in Vaiśālī who had great merit: Dhanika and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. Their house was blessed with divine and human fortune. They did not hear of this agreement.</p>
<p>When the householder Dhanika heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, had arrived at Vaiśālī and was staying in Kūṭāgāraśālā on the bank of Markaṭa Pond near Vaiśālī, he left Vaiśālī and went to the Blessed One . . . when he had . . . delighted him, the Blessed One remained silent. Then the householder Dhanika rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.” The Blessed One assented to the householder Dhanika by remaining silent. Then the householder Dhanika, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from his presence.</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī left Vaiśālī and went to the Blessed One. . . . “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at our house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Vāsiṣṭhas, I have already been invited by the householder Dhanika,” the Blessed One responded.</p>
<p>“Sirs,” they said to one another, “the householder Dhanika broke the agreement of our group.”</p>
<p>Some replied, “How could he break the agreement? Certainly, he must not have heard of the agreement. Anyway, he is a more virtuous man than we, so let’s allow him to offer a meal. We will offer a meal the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda rose early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went to the house of the householder Dhanika. When he arrived, he entered through the eastern gate but saw no seat arranged and no food prepared. He asked the householder Dhanika, “O householder, are you unconcerned, having invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“O noble one, Ānanda, why do you say so?” he replied.</p>
<p>“O householder, I saw no seat arranged and no food prepared.”</p>
<p>“Through which gate did you enter, noble one?”</p>
<p>“O householder, I entered through the eastern one.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, enter through the southern one.”</p>
<p>He entered there and saw divine seats arranged and divine foods prepared. When he saw all that, he felt great wonder.</p>
<p>Thereupon the householder Dhanika’s messenger let the Blessed One know the time: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” . . . Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s wife rose from her seat, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at our house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Dhanika’s wife by remaining silent. Having assented, he preached the Dharma to the householder Dhanika,  rose from his seat, and departed. Dhanika’s wife also prepared food.</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda rose early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went to the house of the householder Dhanika. When arrived, he entered through the southern gate but saw no seat arranged and no food prepared. When he saw this, he asked Dhanika’s wife, “O householder’s wife, are you unconcerned, having invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“O noble one, Ānanda, why do you say so?” she replied.</p>
<p>“I saw no seat arranged and no food prepared.”</p>
<p>“Through which gate did you enter, noble one?”</p>
<p>“Through the southern one.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, enter through the eastern one.”</p>
<p>When he did so, he saw beautiful seats arranged and delicious food prepared. When he saw all that, he felt great wonder.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s wife’s messenger let the Blessed One know the time: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” . . . Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s son rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Dhanika’s son by remaining silent. Then he preached the Dharma to Dhanika’s wife  and departed. Dhanika’s son also prepared a pure and fine meal.</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda rose early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went to the house of the householder Dhanika. Having arrived, he entered through the southern gate but saw no seat arranged and no food prepared. He asked Dhanika’s son, “O householder’s son, are you unconcerned, having invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“O noble one, Ānanda, why do you say so?” he replied.</p>
<p>“I saw no seat arranged and no food prepared.”</p>
<p>“Through which gate did you enter, noble one?”</p>
<p>“Through the southern one.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, enter through the western one.”</p>
<p>When he did so, he saw beautiful seats arranged and delicious food prepared. When he saw them, he felt great wonder.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s son’s messenger let the Blessed One know the time: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” . . . Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s daughter-in-law rose from her seat, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to Dhanika’s daughter-in-law by remaining silent. Then he preached the Dharma to Dhanika’s son and departed.</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmins  and householders in Vaiśālī went to the Blessed One. When they arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then sat down to one side. When they had sat down, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma, . . . delighted the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī and then remained silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at our house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Vāsiṣṭhas,” the Blessed One responded, “I have already been invited by Dhanika’s daughter-in-law.”</p>
<p>Then the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī became furious and shouted, “Sirs, is Dhanika the only one who has wealth? Do we not have any wealth? Since he prepares a meal for the community of monks headed by the Buddha every day, we do not have any opportunity to do so. What should we do about this?”</p>
<p>Some of them urged, “Let us destroy his house, pulling out every stone from it, after the community of monks headed by the Buddha has finished its meal and left.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Ānanda rose early in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and went to the house of the householder Dhanika. When he arrived, he entered through the western gate but saw no seat arranged and no food prepared. He asked Dhanika’s daughter-in-law, “O Dhanika’s daughter-in-law, are you unconcerned, having invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“O noble one, Ānanda, why do you say so?” she replied.</p>
<p>“I saw no seat arranged and no food prepared.”</p>
<p>“Through which gate did you enter, noble one?”</p>
<p>“Through the western one.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, enter through the northern one.”</p>
<p>He entered through the northern gate and saw divine seats arranged and divine foods prepared. When he saw them, he felt great wonder.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s daughter-in-law’s messenger let the Blessed One know the time: “Honored One, the time has arrived. May the Blessed One know that the meal is ready.” The Blessed One . . . sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks.</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī met together and stood at the gate of Dhanika’s house. The Blessed One said to the householder Dhanika, “Householder, an angry mob of people from Vaiśālī is standing at the gate. As they have come to harm you, you should go and ask their pardon.”</p>
<p>When he went out to ask their pardon, they complained to him, “O householder, are you the only person who has wealth? Since you offer a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha every day, we do not have any opportunity to do so.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” he answered, “since I did not heard about any agreement made by the group, it would be reasonable for this crowd of people to pardon me.”</p>
<p>Some of them said, “Sirs, as this is the foremost person, we should pardon him.”</p>
<p>And so they did pardon him. He then said to them, “Please come in.”</p>
<p>When they entered the house and saw beautiful seats arranged and delicious food prepared, they felt great wonder and said, “O householder,  you are the only one qualified to offer a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha. We are not.”</p>
<p>He gave them jewels, but they did not accept them. The Blessed One said, “Accept them, as these jewels are hard to obtain.”</p>
<p>Then they did accept them, and each person’s face shone in the color of what he had accepted.</p>
<p>Thereupon Dhanika’s daughter-in-law knew that the community of monks headed by the Buddha had sat down in comfort, and she served and satisfied them with a pure and fine meal . . . . Knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, she took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma.</p>
<p>The Blessed One knew the thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature of Dhanika and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for them and that caused them to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. Upon hearing it, Dhanika and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law leveled the twenty high peaks of the mountain chain of the false view of individuality with the vajra of knowledge and actualized the fruit of stream-entry. Having seen the truths, they spoke an inspired utterance three times: “. . . We have been truly exalted. Since we seek refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the community of monks, may you accept us as lay followers. From today onward, we embrace our faith as ones who seek refuge throughout our lives.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted Dhanika and his wife, son, and  daughter-in-law through talk consistent with the Dharma, rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p>B. The Former Lives of Dhanika and His Family</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “Honored One, what karma did Dhanika and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law create that matured to cause them, after having been born into a family that is rich and has great wealth and many possessions, to experience divine and human prosperity?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed One replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by them, accruing a heap of karma . . . .</p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once there lived a garland maker in Vārāṇasī. He took a wife from a family of equal rank, and he and she played, made love, and enjoyed themselves. Thus, a son was born. He arranged for a wife for the son, too, from a family that was equal to his.</p>
<p>“Later, he became very poor. He and his son, wife, and daughter-in-law obtained a sheet of cloth with great effort. Then, wearing it, the garland maker offered flowers to a king. The garland maker’s wife also offered flowers to the queens, wearing the same cloth. The garland maker’s son also offered flowers to the princes, wearing the same cloth. The garland maker’s daughter-in-law also offered flowers to the king’s daughters-in-law, wearing the same cloth.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear,  there appear self-awakened ones as the only fields of merit in the world, who are compassionate toward inferior, wretched people and content with places to sit in the outskirts of towns.</p>
<p>“At that time a certain self-awakened one, traveling through the country, arrived at Vārāṇasī toward nightfall. He stayed at the garland maker’s house, which was near the entrance to the city, and spent the night in his household garden. He meditated there on the element of fire, at which point the garland maker saw something like a mass of burning flames. Faith having arisen in him, he told his wife about this, and she also gained faith. She told her son, and he also gained faith. He told his wife, and she also gained faith. Thereupon they began to talk among themselves: ‘Let’s together offer a meal to this mendicant, who has a tranquil nature, even if we do not eat anything tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon, when the night had passed, they did offer almsfood to the self-awakened one. The garland maker said to his wife, ‘Good lady, I will offer my share of the cloth to this mendicant.’</p>
<p>“ ‘My dear, I will offer mine, too,’ she replied.</p>
<p>“ ‘I will offer mine, too.’ said the son.</p>
<p>“And the daughter-in-law said, ‘I will offer mine, too.’</p>
<p>“Then they together dressed him with the cloth. Since such great people do not show things by words but through physical actions, then, out of compassion for them, the great man soared high into the air and began to display miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike. Since ordinary people tend to be swiftly attracted by magical powers, they bowed down to his feet like trees that had been cut at the roots and made aspirations: ‘By this root of merit from our performing a service for the excellent human field of merit, may we be born into a family that is rich and has great wealth and many possessions! May our house be blessed with divine and human fortune!  May we, having attained such qualities, please a teacher who is nobler than this man and not displease him!’</p>
<p>“Thereupon, having exercised his magical power out of compassion for them, the self-awakened one left, flying over the king’s residence. As his shadow fell on the king, the king looked up and saw the great man. He wondered, ‘Whose root of poverty was removed by this great man?’</p>
<p>“The time passed when the garland maker usually offered flowers to the king, and the king was kept waiting for his flowers. Then the garland maker was summoned by the king’s men. The king asked him, ‘Why are you late in bringing flowers today?’</p>
<p>“He explained what had happened in detail. Then the king gave him as many clothes as he needed. Likewise, the queens gave the garland maker’s wife as many clothes as she needed. So did the princes and the king’s daughters-in-law to the garland maker’s son and daughter-in-law, respectively. The garland maker had plenty of flowers, which were his property, and was short of nothing for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That one who was the garland maker at that time, on that occasion, was indeed Dhanika. Those who were the garland maker’s wife, son, and daughter-in-law were Dhanika’s wife, son, and daughter-in-law. Because of the maturation of the karma, namely, their performing a service for the self-awakened one and making aspirations, they were born into a family that was rich and had great wealth and many possessions, and their house was blessed with divine and human fortune.  They saw truths in my presence and pleased me, a teacher who is nobler than a hundred thousand times ten million self-awakened ones, and did not displease me.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>
<p>C. The Rules on Food</p>
<p>Thereupon, having greatly increased their faith, the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī rose from their seats, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of requisites, namely, robes, almsfood, bedding and seats, and medicines for the sick, in our house for three months.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī by remaining silent. Then the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from their seats, and departed. Thereupon the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . Knowing the Blessed One had . . . washed his hands and his bowl, they took low seats and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One instructed, inspired, encouraged, and delighted the brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī through talk consistent with the Dharma, and then rose from his seat and departed.  Two or three days passed in this manner.</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders in Vaiśālī had many attendants. Since a famine had broken out and their kinsmen came to them in search of food, they became oppressed by them and said to the monks, “O noble ones, since a famine has broken out, our kinsmen have come to us to beg for food. Since we give them food every day, we are not able to attend to both you and them sufficiently. O noble ones, we will give you necessities. Please prepare your food by yourselves.”</p>
<p>“We will first ask the Blessed One,” the monks replied.</p>
<p>The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “On account of that, I authorize monks to prepare their food.”</p>
<p>Since the Blessed One had said that monks may prepare food, they began to prepare food. Then they prepared rice soup, cooking it in the open air, but it was ruined because of rainfall. When they reported this matter to the Blessed One, he said, “You should not cook in the open air.”</p>
<p>When they cooked in the gateway building and on the terrace, the Blessed One said, “You should not cook in the gateway building or on the terrace. Monks, the following ten are unsuitable as places for what is allowable. You should not prepare food in these places. What are the ten? The open air, a gateway building, a terrace, a steam-bath house, a bath house, a kings’ place, a place where there are stūpas, places of those who belong to a different faith, a householders’ place, and nunneries. These ten are unsuitable places wherein a monk should not prepare food. If he prepares it there, he becomes guilty of an offense.”</p>

<p>The Sick, Foods,</p>

<p>Lotus Roots, and Miṇḍhaka.</p>
<p>I. The Sick</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>There once was a sick monk in Śrāvastī. He requested a doctor, “Sir, prescribe medicine for me.”</p>
<p>Having asked the cause of the disease, the doctor said, “O noble one, have rice soup, and you will recover your health.”</p>
<p>“Sir,” he replied, “the Blessed One has not authorized that.”</p>
<p>“O noble one,” said the doctor, “since your Teacher is compassionate, it is likely that he will authorize it on this occasion.”</p>
<p>He related this matter to other monks, and then those monks reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “If a doctor tells you to have rice soup, you can have rice soup as the doctor has prescribed. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One said, “You can have rice soup as the doctor has prescribed,” the sick monk’s attendant brought cold rice soup and gave it to him. Thereupon the doctor came and asked, “O noble one, are you well?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am not well,” he answered.</p>
<p>“Did you not have rice soup?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“How did you have it?”</p>
<p>“I had it cold.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, it wasn’t good to do that. Tomorrow, have some that’s warm.”</p>
<p>Then the attendant received rice soup again. Having obtained some that was cold, he heated it and gave it to the sick monk. When the doctor came and asked in the same way, he answered, “I am not well.”</p>
<p>“Did you not have rice soup?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“How did you have it?”</p>
<p>“I had it after heating some that was cold.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, it wasn’t good to do that. Since that food had been cold and was heated, tomorrow have some that is warm from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“Then the attendant, having procured rice and a pot, began to cook the rice under a tree outside the monastery.  However, the food was ruined by a crow’s excrement, and the monk’s condition became worse. He related this matter to other monks, and those monks reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “Monks, in such a case, you can demarcate a place for what is allowable.”</p>
<p>When the Blessed One said that they could demarcate a place for what is allowable, the monks did not know what such a place was and how large it should be. The Blessed One said, “Places for what is allowable are fivefold: those related to erecting, those related to drawing attention, those like cowsheds, empty places, and those demarcated.</p>
<p>“Among these, those related to erecting are as follows: When dwellings are built, there the monk in charge of construction first says, ‘This place will become the community’s place for what is allowable,’ making up his mind and performing the recitation. This is a place for what is allowable related to erecting.</p>
<p>“What are those related to drawing attention? When a stone is first set, the monk in charge of construction says to the neighboring monks, ‘Venerable ones, understand that this place will become the community’s place for what is allowable.’ Since the word ‘understand’ is said, this is called one related to drawing attention.</p>
<p>“What are those like cowsheds? Those where there are separate doors are called ones like cowsheds.</p>
<p>“What are empty places? Places that have been abandoned are called empty places.</p>
<p>“What are those demarcated? They have been demarcated with a formal act consisting of one motion and one proclamation.”</p>
<p>Since the monks did not know how to demarcate those, the Blessed One instructed them: “If the community wishes, a place all forms of which are well fixed, which is within the boundary, and which has a fathom of space outside should be demarcated. Demarcation should be done as follows. When seats have been prepared, the gong has been struck, the monks have been questioned with the words of inquiry,  and all the members of the community are gathered and seated, one monk should propose a motion and perform the formal act: ‘May the community of honored ones listen. This place, all forms of which are well fixed, which is within the boundary, and which has a fathom of space outside, will be demarcated as the community’s place for what is allowable. If it is the right time for the community and the community permits it, may the community consent to demarcating this place . . . as the community’s place for what is allowable.’ This is the motion.</p>
<p>“The formal act should be done as follows: ‘May the community of honored ones listen. This place . . . is wished to be demarcated as the community’s place for what is allowable. If this place . . . is to be demarcated by the community as the community’s place for what is allowable, those among you, venerable ones, who consent to demarcating this place . . . as the community’s place for what is allowable should remain silent. Those who do not consent should speak.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Having authorized and consented to this, the community demarcated this place . . . as the community’s place for what is allowable. I thus take it to be settled on account of your silence.’</p>
<p>“In the demarcated place for what is allowable, two things are allowed: what is cooked within the boundary and what has been kept for a night within the boundary.”</p>
<p>II. Foods</p>
<p>The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in Kūṭāgāraśālā on the bank of Markaṭa Pond near Vaiśālī.</p>
<p>There lived a general named Siṃha in Vaiśālī. His neighbors  used to bring him meat, which he would eat. After he had seen the truth in the presence of the Blessed One, he did not eat meat but had what was brought to him given to monks. When the monks ate it, non-Buddhist ascetics criticized, insulted, and disparaged them: “Sirs, although we have procured meat for the general Siṃha and brought it, he did not eat it but gave it to the śramaṇas, the sons of the Śākyans. The śramaṇas, the sons of the Śākyans, ate the meat intentionally procured.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “I said that meat that is unallowable for three reasons should not be eaten. What are the three? I said that meat that was actually seen by oneself to have been procured for oneself is unallowable meat and should not be eaten; meat about which one has heard from someone reliable, ‘This has been procured for you,’ is unallowable meat and should not be eaten; and meat, about which a conjecture such as ‘This may have been procured for me by some means’ comes to one’s mind, is unallowable meat and should not be eaten.</p>
<p>“Monks, I said meat that is allowable for three reasons can be eaten. What are the three? I said that meat that was not actually seen by oneself to have been procured for oneself is allowable meat and can be eaten; meat, about which one hears from someone reliable, ‘This was not procured for you,’ is allowable meat and can be eaten; and meat, about which a conjecture such as ‘This was procured for me by some means’ does not come to one’s mind, is allowable meat and can be eaten.”</p>
<p>III. Breakfast</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When a famine broke out, the monks were lying on their sides because of hunger. Brahmins and householders said to them, “O noble ones,  the teachings must be practiced devotedly. Why are you lying on your sides, not being intent on good morals?”</p>
<p>“Since a famine has broken out and we do not obtain enough almsfood, we are hungry and weak. That is why we are lying on our sides,” they replied.</p>
<p>The brahmins and householders asked, “Why do you not have breakfast?”</p>
<p>“The Blessed One has not authorized it.”</p>
<p>“Since your Teacher has great compassion, it is likely that he will authorize it on this occasion.”</p>
<p>The monks reported this matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said, “Monks, on account of that, I authorize monks to have breakfast at a time of famine, which is such a calamity and difficulty.”</p>
<p>IV. Leftovers</p>
<p>A. Alms-Food Obtained Previously</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When a famine broke out, pious brahmins and householders said to the monks, “O noble ones, please have a meal here.”</p>
<p>Having had a meal, they went to the monastery, carrying almsfood that they had obtained previously. They wished to eat it because of the disaster of a famine. However, they did not because of some doubts. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, on account of that, I authorize you to eat what you have obtained previously, with the thought that it was received previously, if you so wish, at the time of a famine, which is such a calamity and difficulty. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>B. Leftovers Taken by Monks to the Monastery</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When a famine broke out, pious brahmins and householders invited monks to a meal in their house. They ate but left some khādyaka. The brahmins and householders said, “O noble ones, as we prepared it for you, please take it with you.”</p>
<p>They departed, carrying it. After they departed, they wished to eat the food, but they did not eat it because of some doubts. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, on account of that, I authorize you to eat with the thought that it was given in a famine, which is such a calamity and difficulty. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>C. Leftovers Brought by Laymen</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>When a famine broke out, pious brahmins and householders invited monks to a meal. After they had eaten, some food including khādyaka was left. When the monks departed, the brahmins and householders said, “We presented this only to you, noble ones. Since you came for it, we offer it only to you.” Thus, they took it away. Although the monks wished to eat it, they did not because of some doubts. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, on account of that, I authorize you, in the case of a famine, which is such a calamity and difficulty, to eat with the thought that it was presented earlier.”</p>
<p>V. Fruits Growing in the Forest</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>Pious brahmins and householders obtained fruits that had grown in the western forest. They thought, “Since these are difficult to obtain, we will offer them to the noble ones.” They gave them to monks who had already eaten and finished their meal. The monks did not eat them because they had some doubts, thinking that they had finished their meal. The pious brahmins and householders said, “Noble ones, although when the Blessed One does not appear in the world, we have non-Buddhist ascetics as our fields of merit, now the Blessed One has appeared in the world, and you too are now our fields of merit. If  you do not take the fruits, should we go from this world to another, leaving aside provisions for traveling on the good path? So please, have compassion and take them.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “On account of that, I authorize you to eat them with the thought that they are difficult to obtain. You should not have any regrets about this. Here, fruits that grow in forests are as follows: grapes, pomegranates, kharjūra, chestnuts, almonds, urumāṇa, kurumāyikā, nikoca, babhū, and sin tsi ka.”</p>
<p>VI. Lotus</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>Pious brahmins and householders offered lotuses to monks when they had finished having their meal. Although the monks wished to eat them, they did not because they had some doubts, thinking that they had finished their meal. When the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You can eat them with the thought that they are difficult to obtain. You should not have any regrets about this. Here, the types of lotus are as follows: roots of utpala, roots of padma, seeds of kumuda, and seeds of padma.”</p>
<p>VII. Lotus Roots</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>The venerable Śāriputra’s bodily elements became unbalanced, and thus his blood and phlegm were disturbed. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, who was attending him, thought, “Although I have attended the venerable Śāriputra at my own discretion many times, I have never asked a doctor for advice. Now I will ask for advice.” He requested a doctor, “Sir, since the venerable Śāriputra’s blood and phlegm are disturbed, prescribe medicine for him.”</p>
<p>“O noble one,” answered the doctor, “offer him bisakṣīla, and he will recover his health.”</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana thought, “If I attend the venerable Śāriputra with the juice of ordinary padma roots,  that would not be right of me.” He entered a state of meditation through which, settling his mind, he disappeared from Śrāvastī, went to the bank of a lotus pond called Mandākinī, and approached the residence of the nāga king Supratiṣṭhita. The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita saw him and asked, “O noble one, for what business have you come?”</p>
<p>He replied, “The venerable Śāriputra’s blood and phlegm are disturbed, and a doctor prescribed the juice of padma roots for him.”</p>
<p>“O noble one, then please wait for a moment,” said the nāga king Supratiṣṭhita.</p>
<p>He then dove into Mandākinī Lotus Pond, pulled out some padma roots that were as large as a human, squeezed out the juice of the padma roots onto a padma leaf, and filled the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana’s bowl. The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana examined the crushed padma roots. The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita asked him, “O noble one, what are you looking at? Do you wish me to give you the padma roots?”</p>
<p>He remained silent. The nāga king said, “O noble one, please depart, and I will send them.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, carrying the bowl filled with the juice of the padma roots, disappeared from the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond and went to the Jetavana, the Park of Anāthapiṇḍada near Śrāvastī. The venerable Śāriputra then drank the juice of the padma roots as the doctor had prescribed, and his health returned.</p>
<p>The nāga king Supratiṣṭhita ordered the elephant Wearing a Black Costume, “Carry these padma roots, go to the Jetavana near Śrāvastī, and leave them in the yard of the monastery.” The elephant went as fast as the wind to the monastery in the Jetavana near Śrāvastī, put the padma roots in the yard, and returned. On the way home, it mated with a she-elephant in the forest.  Later, the she-elephant bore an elephant calf. As soon as it was born, it gave a lion’s roar. Frightened, the she-elephant defecated, urinated, and ran away, abandoning the elephant calf. Then a certain carpenter living in Rājagṛha went to the forest to cut some trees and saw the elephant calf. He took it home and fed it. As it was protected (pālita) with wealth (dhana), the elephant calf was named Dhanapālaka.</p>
<p>Other people relate that it was called Dhanapālaka because King Prasenajit sent it to King Bimbisāra as a gift, and it had been protected with wealth by people living in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>The venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana ate one padma root, the venerable Śāriputra another, and the rest were distributed to the community, but some were left over. Then, after having thrown them away, the monks wished to eat them, but they did not, considering that they had thrown them away. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, divine padma roots are difficult for humans to obtain. Therefore, I authorize you to eat them with the thought that they are padma roots that are difficult to obtain. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>VIII. Miṇḍhaka</p>
<p>A. The Conversion of Miṇḍhaka</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>At that time, there lived six people who were famous in the city of Bhadraṃkara for their great merit: namely, a householder named Miṇḍhaka and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave.</p>
<p>How was the householder Miṇḍhaka famous for his great merit? If he looked at empty storehouses, they became full as soon as he looked at them. Thus the householder Miṇḍhaka was famous for his great merit.</p>
<p>And Miṇḍhaka’s wife? If she cooked for one person, the food became servings for a hundred or a thousand people. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s wife.</p>
<p>And Miṇḍhaka’s son? To his waist was tied a purse containing five hundred coins.  When he had spent a hundred or a thousand, it became full just as it had been and never became empty. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s son.</p>
<p>And Miṇḍhaka’s daughter-in-law? If she prepared incense for one person, a hundred or a thousand people were satisfied. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>And Miṇḍhaka’s male slave? When he plowed a furrow in a field, seven furrows were plowed in the field. Such was Miṇḍhaka’s male slave.</p>
<p>And Miṇḍhaka’s female slave famous for her great merit? When she hulled some grain in a mortar, it became sevenfold. Thus Miṇḍhaka’s female slave was famous for her great merit.</p>
<p>At a certain point the Blessed One, knowing it was the time to convert the householder Miṇḍhaka, said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, go and announce to the monks, ‘Monks, the Tathāgata will travel through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara. Those among you who will travel in the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara with the Tathāgata should take their robes.’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One, and he said to the monks, “O venerable ones, the Blessed One will travel through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara. Those among you who will travel in the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara with the Tathāgata should take their robes.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O venerable one,” replied the monks to the venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One traveled through the country to the city of Bhadraṃkara, himself self-controlled and his assembly self-controlled, himself pacified and his assembly pacified, himself an arhat and his assembly arhats.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had shown a great miracle in Śrāvastī, the non-Buddhist ascetics had gone to the borderlands, and some of them had gone to the city of Bhadraṃkara and  settled there. When they heard that the śramaṇa Gautama was coming, they panicked and thought, “We were once expelled from the midland region by the śramaṇa Gautama. Since, if he comes here, we will certainly be expelled from here too, we must devise a plan regarding this.” They went to the houses that had provided them meals and said, “May the Dharma be attained! May the Dharma be attained!”</p>
<p>“O noble ones, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Farewell, we are going.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Since we have seen your prosperity, we will leave before we see your decline.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones, what decline will there be for us?”</p>
<p>“Sirs, the śramaṇa Gautama will come, causing hail like razors and making many people sonless or husbandless.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones, if that is the case, are you abandoning us at the very moment when you should stay? Please stay. Please do not leave.”</p>
<p>“Why should we stay? You are incapable of listening to us,” they said.</p>
<p>“O noble ones, please tell us. We will listen to you.”</p>
<p>“Sirs,” they said, “flush out all the people near the city of Bhadraṃkara from their houses and lead them into the city of Bhadraṃkara. Cut the green grass. Destroy their residences. Cut down trees that bear flowers and fruits. Pour poison in the water.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones,” they replied, “please stay and we will do all of that.”</p>
<p>They then did flush out all the people near the city of Bhadraṃkara from their houses and led them into the city of Bhadraṃkara, cut the green grass, destroyed residences, cut down the flower and fruit trees, and poured poison in the water.</p>
<p>Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, thought, “It would not be right for me to ignore disrespectful acts done against the Blessed One.  The Blessed One has attained supreme wisdom because he completed the six perfections through hundreds of thousands of austerities for three incalculably long eons. Should that Blessed One, who is excellent throughout the whole world, travel in an empty country? I will now strive for the comfort of the Blessed One together with the community of disciples.”</p>
<p>He ordered the sons of the gods who send wind, “Go and dry up the poisoned waters.”</p>
<p>He ordered the sons of the gods who cause rain, “Fill the places they have dried up with water with the eight good qualities.”</p>
<p>He also ordered the gods attendant on the Four Great Kings, “Lead people to live near the city of Bhadraṃkara.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the sons of the gods who send wind dried up the poisoned waters. The sons of the gods who cause rain filled those places with water with the eight good qualities. The gods attendant on the Four Great Kings led people to live near the city of Bhadraṃkara, and the country became prosperous.</p>
<p>The non-Buddhist ascetics gathered people who had lived in the city of Bhadraṃkara and sent spies to see how the country was. They went and saw that the country was very prosperous. They returned and said, “Sirs, we have never seen the country in such prosperity.”</p>
<p>“Sirs, do you see?” replied the non-Buddhist ascetics. “Will he who converts even the land not convert you too? We bid you our final farewell. This will be the last we see of you. We are leaving.”</p>
<p>“O noble ones, please stay,” they implored them. “What harm will the śramaṇa Gautama do to you? He is a mendicant, and you are mendicants who live on alms, too.  Why would he prevent you from begging for alms?”</p>
<p>The non-Buddhist ascetics said, “We will stay if you promise us to make an agreement that none of you will go to see the śramaṇa Gautama, and that if anyone goes, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him.”</p>
<p>They agreed and made that promise.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country, arrived in due course at the city of Bhadraṃkara, and stayed in a certain place south of Bhadraṃkara. At that time, a daughter of a brahmin in Kapilavastu was living in Bhadraṃkara after her marriage. Standing on a wall, she saw the Blessed One in the dark and thought, “This is that Blessed One, the joy of the lineage of the Śākyans, who abandoned the throne belonging to the lineage of the Śākyans and went forth. If I had a ladder here, I would descend, holding a lamp.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, knowing her mind with his own mind, created a ladder. Pleased in her mind, delighted, and gratified, she descended the ladder, holding a lamp, and went to the Blessed One. When she arrived, she put the lamp in front of the Blessed One, bowed low until her forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and sat down to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew her thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma that was appropriate for her and that caused her to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. . . . “I embrace my faith as one who seeks refuge.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One then said to the girl, “Girl, now you should go to the householder Miṇḍhaka. When you have arrived, greet him on my behalf and say, ‘Householder, it is for your sake that I have come here, but you keep your door shut. Is it appropriate to act in such a manner as you do to a guest?’ If  he says that the group of people has made an agreement, say, ‘To your son’s waist is tied a purse containing five hundred coins. When he has spent a hundred or a thousand, it becomes just as it was and never becomes empty. Why can you not pay the sixty kārṣāpaṇas and come?’ ”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One,” replied the girl, who then departed. The Blessed One exercised his magical power so that she went to the householder Miṇḍhaka without being noticed by anyone. When she arrived, she said, “O householder, the Blessed One greets you.”</p>
<p>“Girl, I bow to the Buddha, the Blessed One,” he replied.</p>
<p>“O householder, the Blessed One said, ‘For your sake I have come here, but you keep your door shut. Is it reasonable to act in such a manner as you do to a guest?’ ”</p>
<p>“Girl,” he replied, “people have made an agreement and made a promise that no one should go to see the śramaṇa Gautama, and that if anyone goes, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him.”</p>
<p>“O householder, the Blessed One said, ‘To your son’s waist is tied a purse containing five hundred coins. When he has spent a hundred or a thousand, it becomes just as it was and never becomes empty. Why can you not pay the sixty kārṣāpaṇas and come?’ ’’</p>
<p>He thought, “Since no one knows this, he, the Blessed One, must be omniscient. I will go.”</p>
<p>He put sixty kārṣāpaṇas at his door, descended the ladder as the brahmin girl had told him, and went to the Blessed One. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then sat before the Blessed One to hear the Dharma. The Blessed One knew the householder Miṇḍhaka’s thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and  preached the Dharma that caused him to penetrate the four truths of the noble ones. Having heard it, the householder Miṇḍhaka . . . actualized the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>Having seen the truth, he asked, “O Blessed One, will these people living in Bhadraṃkara attain such good qualities?”</p>
<p>“Householder,” the Blessed One answered, “it depends on you whether many people will do so.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the householder Miṇḍhaka bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence. He went home, arranged a mountain of kārṣāpaṇas in the middle of the city, and spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“Whoever wishes to see the Victor, who has conquered the fault of desire</p>
<p>And is undisputed, incomparable, and golden-colored,</p>
<p>Should go quickly with their minds fearless and well determined.</p>
<p>I will pay their fines.”</p>
<p>People asked, “O householder, will it be good to see the śramaṇa Gautama?”</p>
<p>“It will be good,” he answered.</p>
<p>“If so,” they said, “let us all break the agreement that we made. Is there any objection to this?”</p>
<p>They broke the agreement and began to leave. They jostled one another, however, and were not able to go out. The yakṣa Vajrapāṇi, out of compassion for these people to be led, hurled his vajra and broke the wall, allowing hundreds of thousands of beings to go out, some prompted by curiosity and others spurred by their previous roots of merit. Many people gathered and sat down in an area of one yojana around the Blessed One.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One overwhelmed the assembly with his splendor. He sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks and preached the Dharma, which generated roots of merit in the personal continuums of many beings.  Upon hearing it, some actualized the fruit of stream-entry . . . and some sought refuge and accepted the rules of training.</p>
<p>B. Invitation after Mealtime</p>
<p>As the Blessed One preached the Dharma for a very long time, the mealtime passed. The householder Miṇḍhaka said, “O Blessed One, please have a meal.”</p>
<p>“Householder, the mealtime has passed,” answered the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, what is appropriate after the mealtime?” he asked.</p>
<p>The Blessed One answered, “Ghee, guḍa, khaṇḍa, śarkarā, and drinks.”</p>
<p>Then the householder Miṇḍhaka called his cooks and said, “Sirs, quickly prepare the khādyaka to be eaten after the mealtime.”</p>
<p>They prepared the khādyaka to be eaten after the mealtime. Then the householder Miṇḍhaka satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with the khādyaka to be eaten after the mealtime and drinks to be drunk after the mealtime. Thereupon the Blessed One established the householder Miṇḍhaka, along with his attendants, in the truths, converted also the inhabitants of the hamlet, and departed.</p>
<p>C. The Acceptance of Money</p>
<p>“O Blessed One,” said the householder Miṇḍhaka, “please accept kārṣāpaṇas for provisions for illness while traveling.”</p>
<p>“They may be accepted,” replied the Blessed One.</p>
<p>When the Blessed One had said that kārṣāpaṇas may be accepted, the monks did not know who should accept them. The Blessed One said, “A person who makes things allowable should do so.”</p>
<p>Since there was no one who makes things allowable, the Blessed One said, “A novice should do so.”</p>
<p>The venerable Upālin asked the Buddha, the Blessed One, “O Honored One, although the Blessed One has prohibited acceptance of gold and silver in the tenth rule of training for novices, the Blessed One has now said, ‘A novice should accept them.’ What does this mean?”</p>
<p>“Upālin,” replied the Blessed One, “I meant ‘keeping’ when I prohibited it, not ‘accepting.’ Thus, novices may accept kārṣāpaṇas, but they should not keep the kārṣāpaṇas for their personal use.”</p>
<p>D. The Acceptance of Guḍa</p>
<p>“O Blessed One, please accept guḍa,” offered the householder Miṇḍhaka.</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied, “It may be accepted.”</p>
<p>The monks did not know who should accept it and how. The Blessed One explained, “If there is no layman or novice, a monk should carry it by himself after having taken formal possession of it as medicine to be consumed within seven days.”</p>
<p>The monks did not know how to take formal possession of it. The Blessed One instructed them, “After having washed one’s hands, one should take it, place it on the left hand, cover it with the right hand, sit before another monk, and say, ‘O venerable one, pay attention, please. I, named So-and-so (the monk says his name), take formal possession of this medicine as medicine to be consumed within seven days for myself and my fellow monks.’ He should then say this a second and a third time.”</p>
<p>The venerable Upālin asked the Buddha, the Blessed One, “O Honored One, the Blessed One has said that one may take formal possession of guḍa as medicine to be consumed within seven days. Who should eat it?”</p>
<p>“Upālin, five kinds of people should: those who are traveling, those who have fasted, the sick, the one responsible for monastic property, and the one in charge of construction.”</p>
<p>Monks traveling through the country put guḍa in rice and barley groats. Although they wished to eat it as they were fatigued from traveling, they did not because of some doubts. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, since it would be insubstantial as a meal, you may eat some that has been put in rice after shaking the rice grains off  and some that has been put in barley groats after washing it in water.”</p>
<p>They were not able to wash some that had melted, and it became mixed with the meal. The Blessed One said, “You should cut it with a piece of bamboo and wash it in water.”</p>
<p>Still, they were not able to separate it from food for a meal. The Blessed One said, “You should carefully remove the food for a meal. Rubbing it in water, you should make the guḍa into a drink, strain it with a strainer, and drink it. You should not have any regrets about this.”</p>
<p>E. The Former Lives of the Miṇḍhaka Family</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did Miṇḍhaka and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave create that matured to cause these six to have great merit, see the truth in the presence of the Blessed One, and please the Blessed One and not displease him?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” the Blessed one replied, “the actions were performed and accumulated by these people themselves, accruing a heap of karma, . . . .</p>
<p>“ . . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, once in the city of Vārāṇasī a king named Brahmadatta was ruling over the country. At that time, astrologers predicted a twelve-year drought in Vārāṇasī, saying, ‘There will be a great famine of “living by means of a stick.” ’</p>
<p>“There are three types of famine, namely, ‘basket,’ ‘white bones,’ and ‘living by means of a stick.’ Among these, ‘basket’ means that people fill a basket with seeds and put it aside for the sake of future beings and think, ‘After our death, these seeds will help those people.’ As this type of famine is related to a basket, it is called ‘basket.’ What is ‘white bones’? At that time people collect bones, boil them until they become white,  and then drink the liquid. As this type of famine is related to white bones, it is called ‘white bones.’ What is ‘living by means of a stick’? At that time people dig lumps of grains with a stick out of a hole in a granary, boil them in a pot filled with much water, and drink the water. As this type of famine is related to a stick, it is called ‘living by means of a stick.’</p>
<p>“Thereupon King Brahmadatta proclaimed with the ringing of bells in Vārāṇasī, ‘Listen, citizens living in my country! Astrologers have predicted that because of a twelve-year drought there will be a great famine of “basket,” “white bones,” and “living by means of a stick.” Whoever among you has food for twelve years should stay. Those who do not should go anywhere they like and come back when there is no famine but an abundant harvest.’</p>
<p>“At that time there was a householder in Vārāṇasī who was rich and had great wealth, many possessions, and a large family. He called the storehouse keeper and asked, ‘My good man, is there enough food for me and my attendants to survive for twelve years?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Yes, there is, Master,’ the storehouse keeper answered.</p>
<p>“And so he stayed. However, famines occurred continuously, and his storehouses became exhausted. All his attendants died, and only six people including himself survived. When the householder then swept his storehouses, he obtained one prastha of grains. His wife poured it into a pot and boiled it.</p>
<p>“When the buddhas do not appear, there appear self-awakened ones as the only fields of merit in the world . . . . At that time a certain self-awakened one arrived at Vārāṇasī, having traveled in the country. He dressed in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Vārāṇasī for alms. The householder was then preparing his meal. Begging for alms, the self-awakened one  arrived in due course at his house. When the householder saw him, whose body was attractive and whose mind was pure, he thought, ‘Even if I eat this now, I will certainly die. I will give my portion of this to this mendicant.’ He said to his wife, ‘Good lady, I will offer my portion to this mendicant.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Why should I eat, while my husband does not?’ she thought, and she said, ‘My dear, I will also offer my portion to him.’</p>
<p>“His son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave also considered likewise and gave up their portions. Thereupon they all met together and offered almsfood to the self-awakened one. Since such great people do not show things by words but with their bodies, he soared high into the air as if a haṃsa king had stretched its wings to fly, and began to display miracles, namely, blazing fire, radiating light, causing rain to fall, and causing lightning to strike in their presence. Since ordinary people tend to be swiftly attracted by magical powers, they bowed down to his feet like trees that had been cut at the roots and uttered their aspirations.</p>
<p>“The householder made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit from my serving a man who is truly worthy of offerings, when I look at empty warehouses and storehouses, may they become full as soon as I look at them! Having attained such qualities, may I please a teacher who is nobler even than this man and not displease him!’</p>
<p>“The wife made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit . . . , when I cook for one person, may the food be eaten by a hundred or a thousand people and never be exhausted until I stop preparing it . . . !’</p>
<p>“The son made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit . . . , may a purse containing five hundred coins tied to my waist, when I spend a hundred or a thousand of them, become full just as it was and never become empty . . . !’</p>
<p>“The daughter-in-law made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit . . . , when I prepare incense for one person, may a hundred or a thousand people enjoy it and may it not be exhausted until I stop preparing it  . . . !’</p>
<p>“Their male slave made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit . . . , when I plow one furrow in a field, may seven furrows be plowed . . . !’</p>
<p>“Their female slave made this aspiration: ‘By this root of merit . . . , when I hull some grains in a vessel, may they fill seven vessels . . . !’</p>
<p>“When they had all made such aspirations, that great man, the self-awakened one, having entertained compassion for them, departed through his magical power. At that time, King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace and was sitting there. The shadow of the one flying with his magical power fell on King Brahmadatta.  He looked up and saw the self-awakened one and wondered, ‘Whose root of poverty was removed by a large plow, which is this great man’s magical power?’</p>
<p>“Thereafter, when that householder looked at his warehouses and storehouses with great hope, he saw them full. He said to his wife, ‘Since my wish has been fulfilled first, now we should see yours.’ Indeed, when the female slave hulled some grains in a mortar, they increased sevenfold. When the wife cooked food in a pot for one person, it became food to be eaten by all of them, along with a thousand neighboring beings.</p>
<p>“Thereupon the householder proclaimed with the ringing of bells in Vārāṇasī, ‘Sirs, whoever among you has a need should come!’</p>
<p>“There was then a loud, noisy cry in Vārāṇasī. Upon hearing that, the king asked, ‘Sirs, what is this loud, noisy cry?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty,’ his ministers replied, ‘a householder named So-and-so has opened his warehouses and storehouses.’</p>
<p>“ ‘Did the householder open his warehouses and storehouses only after everyone in the world has died?’ asked the king. ‘Sirs, summon that householder.’</p>
<p>“They summoned him, and then the king asked him, ‘Householder, did you open your warehouses and storehouses only after everyone in the world has died?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, whose warehouses and storehouses were opened? (It is not the case that I opened my warehouses and storehouses after concealing foods there for a long time, but seeds sowed today bore fruit just today.)’</p>
<p>“ ‘What does that mean?’ demanded the king.</p>
<p>“He then explained what had happened in detail. The king asked, ‘Householder, did you offer a meal to that great man?’</p>
<p>“ ‘Your Majesty, I did.’</p>
<p>“He became more pious and spoke a verse:</p>
<p>“How great the field is, which was</p>
<p>Born from merit and is free from all faults—</p>
<p>From seeds sowed there,</p>
<p>Fruit was harvested just today.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The householder and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave were indeed this householder Miṇḍhaka and his wife, son, daughter-in-law, male slave, and female slave. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, their performing services for a self-awakened one and making aspirations, these six became possessors of great merit, saw the truth in my presence, who is a teacher nobler than a hundred billion self-awakened ones. They pleased me and did not displease me.</p>
<p>“Therefore, monks, the maturation of entirely negative actions is entirely negative; the maturation of entirely positive actions is entirely positive . . . you should seek . . . . Monks, that is how you must train.”</p>

<p>I. The Drink Offered by Kaineya Was Received</p>
<p>A. The Conversion of Kaineya and Śaila (Prose)</p>
<p>The Blessed One was once staying in the dwelling place in Ādumā.</p>
<p>1. The Sermon to the Four Great Kings</p>
<p>At that time, the ṛṣi Kaineya had his dwelling place in Ādumā and was spending the day on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond.</p>
<p>The Blessed One asked himself, “Where should I preach the Dharma to the Four Protectors of the World in order to convert the ṛṣi Kaineya with little effort?” Then the Blessed One understood, “If I preach the Dharma on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond, there he will be converted.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One entertained mundane thoughts. It naturally occurs that when the buddhas, the blessed ones, entertain mundane thoughts, Śakra, Brahmā, and other gods understand the Blessed One’s thoughts. Great King Vaiśravaṇa asked himself,  “For the sake of what did the Blessed One entertain mundane thoughts?” He then realized, “He wishes to preach the Dharma to us, the Four Protectors of the World.” Having realized this, he ordered Pāñcika, the great general of the yakṣas, “Pāñcika, go and prepare a seat for the Blessed One on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond. Install a guard for the ṛṣi Kaineya so that no one will spoil his luster when there is a large assemblage.”</p>
<p>Having installed a guard for the ṛṣi Kaineya on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond, he was preparing a seat for the Blessed One when the sound of many people arose. Because of the noise, the ṛṣi Kaineya stood up and asked the guard, “What is this noise?”</p>
<p>“They are preparing a seat,” he answered.</p>
<p>“Is that for me?”</p>
<p>“It is not for you, but for the Buddha, the Blessed One.”</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“To guard none but you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because there will be a large assemblage.”</p>
<p>The ṛṣi asked, “Who will guard that śramaṇa Gautama?”</p>
<p>“Who could guard that Blessed One?” answered the guard. “The Blessed One himself is the guard of the world including gods.”</p>
<p>When he heard this, the ṛṣi Kaineya remained silent.</p>
<p>The Blessed One then dressed in the morning, took his bowl and his robe, and entered Ādumā for alms. After having begged for food, he had his meal. Afterward he returned, settled his mind, and entered a state of meditation by which he disappeared from Ādumā with the community of monks and appeared on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond. The Blessed One then sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks.</p>
<p>Then Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra with many attendants—hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of them, all of whom were gandharvas—went to the Blessed One, with the front part of his garment filled with divine jewels.  When he arrived, he scattered the divine jewels for the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then sat to the east, attending the Blessed One and the community of monks.</p>
<p>Great King Virūḍhaka, too, with many hundreds and thousands—hundreds of thousands—of attendants, all of whom were kumbhāṇḍas, went to the Blessed One, with the front part of his garment filled with divine pearls. When he arrived, he scattered the divine pearls for the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then sat to the south, attending the Blessed One and the community of monks.</p>
<p>Great King Virūpākṣa, too, with many hundreds and thousands—hundreds of thousands—of attendants, all of whom were nāgas, went to the Blessed One, with the front part of his garment filled with divine utpala, padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka, and māndāraka flowers. When he arrived, he scattered the divine utpala, padma, kumuda, puṇḍarīka, and māndāraka flowers for the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then sat to the west, attending the Blessed One and the community of monks.</p>
<p>Great King Vaiśravaṇa, too, with many hundreds and thousands—hundreds of thousands—of attendants, all of whom were yakṣas, went to the Blessed One, with the front part of his garment filled with pieces of divine gold. When he arrived, he scattered the pieces of divine gold for the Blessed One, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, then sat to the north, attending the Blessed One and the community of monks.</p>
<p>Among those four, those who had their origin in the midlands were two: Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Virūḍhaka; those who had their origin in the borderlands were two: Virūpākṣa and Vaiśravaṇa. Thereupon the Blessed One thought, “If I preach the Dharma in the language of the midlands, only two of them will understand, while the other two will not. If I preach the Dharma in the language of the borderlands, only two of them will understand, while the other two will not. I will now preach the Dharma to two in the language of the midlands and to the other two in the languages of the borderlands.” He said to Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, “Great King, thus the body is destroyed, feelings have become cool, perceptions have ceased, formations have been pacified, and consciousness has disappeared—this is the end of suffering.”</p>
<p>While this teaching device of the Dharma was being preached, the Dharma eye, which is free from dust and stain and with which he could observe every phenomenon, was generated in Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, as well as the hundreds of thousands of gandharvas belonging to the same tribe as he.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to Great King Virūḍhaka, “Great King, here, what you see, hear, think, and understand should be only seeing, hearing, thinking, and understanding.”</p>
<p>While this teaching device of the Dharma was being preached, the Dharma eye, which is free from dust and stain and with which he could observe every phenomenon, was generated in Great King Virūḍhaka, as well as the hundreds of thousands of kumbhāṇḍas belonging to the same tribe as he.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to Great King Virūpākṣa, “Therefore, Great King, ine mene dapphe daḍapphe. This is the end of suffering.”</p>
<p>While this teaching device of the Dharma was being preached, the Dharma eye, which is free from dust and stain and with which he could observe every phenomenon, was generated in Great King Virūpākṣa, as well as the hundreds of thousands of nāgas belonging to the same tribe as he.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One said to Great King Vaiśravaṇa, “Therefore, Great King, māśā tuṣā saṃśāmā sarvatra virāḍi. This is the end of suffering.”</p>
<p>While this teaching device of the Dharma was being preached, the Dharma eye, which is free from dust and stain and with which he could observe every phenomenon, was generated in Great King Vaiśravaṇa, as well as the hundreds of thousands of yakṣas belonging to the same tribe as he.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One thought, “Now I am gradually approaching the time to be completely emancipated. To whom should I entrust my teachings before being completely emancipated? If I entrust them to gods, they will not last long, for gods are careless and enjoy much pleasure. But if I entrust them to humans, they will not last long, either, for humans have shorter lives. I will now entrust them to these gods, humans, and the monk Kāśyapa before being completely emancipated.” Having thus thought, he said to Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, “Great King, you should protect my teachings in the east after I am completely emancipated.”</p>
<p>He said to Great King Virūḍhaka, “Great King, you also should protect them in the south.”</p>
<p>He said to Great King Virūpākṣa, “Great King, you also should protect them in the west.”</p>
<p>He said to Great King Vaiśravaṇa, “Great King, you also should protect them in the north.”</p>
<p>Then the Four Great Kings, their minds pleased, said to the Blessed One, “May everything be as the Blessed One has said! O Blessed One, we will protect them.”</p>
<p>Having thus spoken and seen the truths before the Blessed One, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then departed from the Blessed One’s presence. The Blessed One entrusted all his teachings to the venerable Mahākāśyapa and  said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, you also should exert yourself in carrying out your duties in accordance with the teachings.”</p>
<p>2. The Former Lives of the Four Great Kings</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “O Honored One, what karma did the Four Great Kings create that matured to cause them to become the Four Great Kings and see the truths in the presence of the Blessed One?”</p>
<p>“Monks,” replied the Blessed One, “the actions were performed and accumulated by these ones themselves in other lives, accruing a heap of karma, whose conditions have ripened . . . .</p>
<p>“. . . </p>
<p>They bear fruit in embodied beings.</p>
<p>“Monks, at a certain point in this fortunate eon, when people’s lifespans were twenty thousand years long, there appeared in the world a teacher named Kāśyapa, who was . . . a teacher of gods and humans, a buddha, and a blessed one. At that time, there lived in the great ocean two nāgas named Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa. There were two garuḍas named Aṭṭeśvara and Cūḍeśvara on a kūṭaśālmalī tree. Whenever these two attacked Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa, the two nāgas escaped underground. Later, after Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa had sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training, the garuḍas again began to attack these two, but they were obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru. The two garuḍas then inquired of them, ‘Sirs, when we attacked you before, you used to escape underground. Why, when we meet you now, are we obstructed and repulsed, just as wind and water are obstructed and repulsed by Mount Sumeru? What is the cause of this?’</p>
<p>“Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa  answered, ‘We sought refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accepted the rules of training.’</p>
<p>“ ‘If that is the case, we will do so, too,’ said the two garuḍas.</p>
<p>“The two garuḍas then went to the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa with the two nāgas. When they arrived, they saw the Four Protectors of the World depart after they had heard the Dharma in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa. The two garuḍas asked the two nāgas, Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa, ‘Who are those ones departing?’</p>
<p>“The two nāgas explained about this in detail, and the two garuḍas replied, ‘If that is the case, we will also seek refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, accept the rules of training, and make aspirations.’ The two garuḍas then did seek refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and accept the rules of training. Śvāsa and Mahāśvāsa had already accepted them before. Then they together threw themselves at the feet of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa and made these aspirations: ‘Just as these Four Protectors of the World, after having heard the Dharma in the presence of the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, saw the truths and departed for their residences, may we also, by this root of merit, become the Four Protectors of the World! May that Blessed One, whom a young brahmin called Uttara was predicted to become by the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa—“Young brahmin, you will become a tathāgata, an arhat, a perfectly awakened one called Śākyamuni when people’s lifespans are a hundred years long”—preach the Dharma for us on the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond! May we, too, after having heard the Dharma, see the truths and depart for our residences just as they did!’</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The ones who were those four—the nāgas and garuḍas—are indeed these Four Protectors of the World. That one who was Śvāsa at that time, on that occasion, is indeed this Dhṛtarāṣṭra. That one who was Mahāśvāsa is indeed this Virūḍhaka. That one who was Aṭṭeśvara is indeed this Virūpākṣa. That one who was Cūḍeśvara is indeed this Vaiśravaṇa. Because of the maturation of that karma, namely, their seeking refuge in the Perfectly Awakened One Kāśyapa, accepting the rules of training, and making aspirations at that time, on that occasion, they became the Four Protectors of the World, saw the truths in my presence, and departed for their residences.”</p>
<p>3. Kaineya Offers Drinks to the Blessed One</p>
<p>Having heard that Dharma preached, the ṛṣi Kaineya felt greatly pleased and was filled with faith in the Blessed One. The Blessed One knew his thinking, proclivity, disposition, and nature and preached the Dharma, through which the ṛṣi Kaineya penetrated the four truths of the noble ones and actualized the fruit of a never-returner.</p>
<p>Thereupon, having acquired faith founded in knowledge, he went to the Blessed One, bringing eight kinds of drinks: namely, coconut drink, banana drink, kola drink, aśvattha drink, udumbara drink, paruṣaka drink, kharjūra drink, and grape drink. When he arrived, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, since these eight kinds of drinks are praised and extolled by ancient ṛṣis, may the Blessed One have compassion and accept them.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One did have compassion for the ṛṣi Kaineya and accepted the eight kinds of drinks. Having accepted them, he said to the monks,  “Monks, if these eight kinds of drinks have been accepted at the appropriate time (i.e., in the morning), squeezed at the appropriate time, and strained at the appropriate time, and if their formal possession has been taken at the appropriate time, they may be consumed at either the appropriate time or an inappropriate time (i.e., after noon), but they should not be consumed after the first watch of the night has passed.</p>
<p>“If these eight kinds of drinks have been accepted at the appropriate time, but squeezed at an inappropriate time, and strained at an inappropriate time, and if their formal possession has been taken at an inappropriate time, they should not be consumed.</p>
<p>“If these eight kinds of drinks have been accepted at the appropriate time, squeezed at the appropriate time, but strained at an inappropriate time, and if their formal possession has been taken at an inappropriate time, they should not be consumed.</p>
<p>“If these eight kinds of drinks have been accepted at an inappropriate time, squeezed at an inappropriate time, and strained at an inappropriate time, they should neither be consumed after a meal nor after the first half of the night has passed.”</p>
<p>4. Śaila and Kaineya Go Forth</p>
<p>Thereupon the ṛṣi Kaineya rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to him, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the ṛṣi Kaineya by remaining silent. Then the ṛṣi Kaineya, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, rose from his seat and departed. The Blessed One also disappeared from the bank of Mandākinī Lotus Pond and went to Ādumā with the community of monks.</p>
<p>The ṛṣi Kaineya rose before dawn and said to his family, “Noble ones, get up! Sirs, get up! Cut firewood! Light a fire! Distribute khādyaka! Clean the dining halls!”</p>
<p>At that time, a ṛṣi named Śaila, who was a nephew of the ṛṣi Kaineya, was staying in that very house. When the ṛṣi Śaila heard the ṛṣi Kaineya rise before dawn  and speak to his family, he asked the ṛṣi Kaineya, “O ṛṣi, have you invited your fellow ṛṣis? Have you invited King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha or people dwelling around the palace? Or is there any accomplishment of ṛṣis’ dharma that is desired?”</p>
<p>“Śaila,” he replied, “I have not invited my fellow ṛṣis. I have not invited King Śreṇya Bimbisāra of Magadha or people dwelling around the palace. This is not any accomplishment of ṛṣis’ dharma that is desired, either. But I have invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal.”</p>
<p>When Śaila heard the sound buddha, a sound he had never heard before, the hair on his entire body stood on end. He asked respectfully, “O ṛṣi, who is the Buddha?”</p>
<p>“Śaila, there is a son of the Śākyans called śramaṇa Gautama, one who went forth from the Śākyan family into homelessness in true faith, having shaved off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes. He was awakened to complete and supreme awakening. Śaila, he is the Buddha.”</p>
<p>“O ṛṣi,” asked Śaila, “what is the community?”</p>
<p>“Śaila,” the ṛṣi Kaineya replied, “among the sons of kṣatriya families, there are those who went forth from their home into homelessness in true faith, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned saffron robes. Among the sons of brahmin families, vaiśya families, and śūdra families, too, there are those who went forth . . . following the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, who had gone forth. Śaila, these are the community. Śaila, I have invited this community and the Buddha that I already mentioned,  namely, ‘the community of monks headed by the Buddha,’ for a meal.”</p>
<p>Thereupon, being mindful of the Buddha, the ṛṣi Śaila rose early in the morning and went to the Blessed One with his five hundred attendants. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the ṛṣi Śaila said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.” The ṛṣi Śaila and his five hundred attendants then attained monkhood, which belongs to those who have gone forth and have been ordained in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.</p>
<p>Thereupon the ṛṣi Kaineya prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . served and satisfied them . . . . When he served the community of monks headed by the Buddha with a meal, he saw Śaila, who had gone forth. He asked him, “Śaila, did you go forth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“Well done! Well done, indeed! I will go forth, too, after I have finished serving the meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha.”</p>
<p>Then the ṛṣi Kaineya, with his own hands and in a variety of ways, served and satisfied the community of monks headed by the Buddha with a pure and fine meal. Knowing the Blessed One had finished his meal and washed his hands and his bowl, he took a low seat and sat before the Blessed One in order to hear the Dharma. Then the Blessed One assigned the rewards of the offerings to him, gave a sermon, and departed.</p>
<p>Thereupon the ṛṣi Kaineya, having thrown off everything unnecessary,  went to the Blessed One with his five hundred attendants. When he arrived, he bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the ṛṣi Kaineya said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, I wish to go forth and be ordained a monk in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya. I will lead the pure life in the presence of the Blessed One.” The ṛṣi Kaineya with his five hundred attendants then attained monkhood, which belongs to those who have gone forth and have been ordained in the well-taught Dharma and Vinaya.</p>
<p>5. The Instruction by Three Disciples of the Buddha</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One undertook the rainy-season retreat in the Parasol mango grove on the bank of the river Prabhadrikā with those thousand monks who had newly gone forth and had been ordained.</p>
<p>There, the Blessed One entrusted five hundred monks to the venerable Brāhmaṇa­kapphiṇa, two hundred and fifty to the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana, and two hundred and fifty to the venerable Śāriputra. Those who were instructed by the venerable Brāhmaṇa­kapphiṇa abandoned all the defilements and actualized the state of an arhat, those by the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana the fruit of once-returners, and those by the venerable Śāriputra the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p>6. The Former Lives of the Three Disciples</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, inquired of the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, “How is it, O Honored One, that, although the Blessed One has praised the venerable Śāriputra as the best of those who have great wisdom, and the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana as the best of those who have great power and great magical power, those who were instructed by the venerable Brāhmaṇa­kapphiṇa actualized the state of an arhat, those by the venerable Mahā­maudgalyāyana the fruit of once-returners, and those by the venerable Śāriputra  the fruit of stream-entry?”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks,” the Blessed One replied, “how, not only in the present but also in the past, those who were instructed by Brāhmaṇa­kapphiṇa were established in the formless realm, those by Maudgalyāyana in the form realm, and those by Śāriputra in the five kinds of supernormal knowledge.</p>
<p>“Monks, there once lived two ṛṣis in the wilderness, each of whom had five hundred attendants. One day, one of those two died. His young brahmins, tormented by pain and despair over parting from their teacher, wandered here and there and came to the other ṛṣi. When he saw them with their eyes full of tears, he asked them, ‘Young brahmins, where did your teacher go?’</p>
<p>“ ‘He died.’</p>
<p>“He thought, ‘After my death, my young brahmins will be in the same situation as these ones. I will now accept them.’ He then encouraged them and accepted them.</p>
<p>“Later, one day, this ṛṣi also became sick. He had three best pupils, and he entrusted five hundred young brahmins to the first one, two hundred and fifty to the second one, and another two hundred and fifty to the third one. Then, he passed away.</p>
<p>“At that point, the one who was entrusted with five hundred instructed them so that they were established in the formless realm; the second who was entrusted with two hundred and fifty instructed them so that they were established in the form realm; and the third who was assigned two hundred and fifty instructed them so that they were established in the five supernormal powers.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? That ṛṣi who established five hundred young brahmins in the formless realm at that time, on that occasion,  was indeed this monk Kapphiṇa. The one who established two hundred and fifty in the form realm was indeed this monk Maudgalyāyana. The other one who established two hundred and fifty in the five kinds of supernormal knowledge was indeed this monk Śāriputra.</p>
<p>“However, monks, those who were instructed by Kapphiṇa are of keen faculties, those by Maudgalyāyana are of mediocre faculties, and those by Śāriputra are of dull faculties. If they had not been instructed by Śāriputra, they would not even have attained the stage of warmth.”</p>
<p>B. The Conversion of Kaineya and Śaila (Verse)</p>
<p>Just as Kaineya, who had dreadlocked hair,</p>
<p>Expressed his praise of the Buddha,</p>
<p>Everyone should listen in harmony</p>
<p>With their minds filled with faith.</p>
<p>One day, in Kaineya’s house,</p>
<p>The Teacher possessing great power</p>
<p>Was invited for a meal</p>
<p>With his disciples.</p>
<p>In Kaineya’s house,</p>
<p>The ṛṣi Śaila saw</p>
<p>A meal being prepared.</p>
<p>When he saw that, he asked Kaineya,</p>
<p>“Are you having a wedding?</p>
<p>Or have you invited the king or the whole kingdom?</p>
<p>Is this your great offering?</p>
<p>Please answer my question.”</p>
<p>“I am not having any wedding,</p>
<p>Nor have I invited the king or the whole kingdom.</p>
<p>I have invited the Buddha,</p>
<p>The best living being, for a meal.”</p>
<p>When Śaila heard the sound buddha,</p>
<p>His mind was stirred up.</p>
<p>“What is that buddha, Kaineya?</p>
<p>Please answer my question.”</p>
<p>“There is a teacher, a matchless man,</p>
<p>Born into the Śākyan family.</p>
<p>He possesses understanding (buddhi) of all dharmas—</p>
<p>Therefore, he is called Buddha.</p>
<p>“All conditioned things have a destructible nature.</p>
<p>The Buddha saw the past;</p>
<p>Likewise, he sees the future</p>
<p>And also the present.</p>
<p>“The omniscient one knows</p>
<p>Everything that may be recognized.</p>
<p>He knows everything and sees everything—</p>
<p>Therefore, he is called Buddha.</p>
<p>“He has recognized what is to be recognized,</p>
<p>Has meditated upon what is to be meditated upon,</p>
<p>And has abandoned what is to be abandoned—</p>
<p>Therefore, he is called Buddha.</p>
<p>“The one at whose birth</p>
<p>The land quaked,</p>
<p>Including its oceans and mountains—</p>
<p>To him I make the gesture of supplication and bow.</p>
<p>“The one who defeated Māra,</p>
<p>The friend of darkness, with his minions,</p>
<p>And attained the power of a tathāgata—</p>
<p>To him I make the gesture of supplication and bow.</p>
<p>“The one who went to the city of Vārāṇasī</p>
<p>And turned the wheel of the Dharma</p>
<p>Consisting of twelve elements—</p>
<p>To him I make the gesture of supplication and bow.</p>
<p>“The one who liberated many beings</p>
<p>Bound by the fetters of desire</p>
<p>And tormented by desire and hatred—</p>
<p>To him I make the gesture of supplication and bow.”</p>
<p>“Where is the Buddha, the Blessed One?</p>
<p>How far from here is that leader?</p>
<p>I will seek refuge from today onward</p>
<p>In the son of the Śākyans, who is like the sun.”</p>
<p>“Go, brahmin, and</p>
<p>In that pleasant grove you will</p>
<p>See the Buddha, the supreme one,</p>
<p>Who is like the king of gandharvas,</p>
<p>“Whose saffron robe is bright,</p>
<p>Who, golden-colored, emits sun-like rays of light</p>
<p>And looks like heated gold</p>
<p>Or an image made of gold,</p>
<p>“Who is like the flower of the sāla tree</p>
<p>And the karṇikāra flower,</p>
<p>Who is like a jeweled pillar</p>
<p>Covered with various jewels.</p>
<p>“Well balanced in his height and girth</p>
<p>Like a banyan tree,</p>
<p>He illuminates his surroundings</p>
<p>With a fathom-wide halo.</p>
<p>“The Muni, who abandoned his magnificent kingdom</p>
<p>Abundant in the objects of desire and pleasure, where his relatives were,</p>
<p>And departed to go forth,</p>
<p>Rejoices in solitude.</p>
<p>“Just as a lion on Mount Gandhamādana</p>
<p>Has no fear in the forest,</p>
<p>He speaks without fear like a lion—</p>
<p>Brahmin, you will see him, the Buddha.</p>
<p>“He smiles, speaks gentle words</p>
<p>With Brahmā’s voice, a sweet voice,</p>
<p>And his voice is like the sound of drums—</p>
<p>Brahmin, you will see him, the Buddha.</p>
<p>“He is like the disk of the moon,</p>
<p>The clear moon</p>
<p>Surrounded by constellations in the sky—</p>
<p>Brahmin, you will see him, the Buddha.</p>
<p>“Just as the sun emitting rays of light</p>
<p>Is beautiful in the sky,</p>
<p>The Buddha, free from darkness, is beautiful—</p>
<p>Brahmin, you will see him.</p>
<p>“The bull among men, possessed of the ten powers,</p>
<p>Is just like a bull with a hump, the head of its herd,</p>
<p>Standing immovably—</p>
<p>Brahmin, you will see him, the Buddha.</p>
<p>“Like the sea,</p>
<p>The deep, immeasurable great ocean,</p>
<p>The Buddha, the best of meditators,</p>
<p>Is inconceivable and unsurpassed—you will see him.</p>
<p>“Like the sun after the dark half of the month,</p>
<p>Which is bright in the sky</p>
<p>Like a mass of burning fire—</p>
<p>You will see him, the Buddha Gautama.</p>
<p>“Just as a wheel-turning king is</p>
<p>Surrounded by ten million ministers,</p>
<p>The Completely Awakened One,</p>
<p>Who is served by arhats, is beautiful.</p>
<p>“Just like the one reigning over the desire realm</p>
<p>And Mahābrahmā, the ruler,</p>
<p>The Muni reigns</p>
<p>Over the worlds of the billionfold universe.</p>
<p>“The truths of various kinds of suffering,</p>
<p>The arising of suffering,</p>
<p>The cessation of suffering,</p>
<p>And the path consisting of eight parts—</p>
<p>“Through the hearing of which one will be pacified,</p>
<p>And will cross the great ocean of suffering—</p>
<p>He reveals these truths,</p>
<p>Which taste like pure honey.</p>
<p>“He gives wealth to those who lack wealth,</p>
<p>Cures the sick,</p>
<p>Becomes a refuge to those who are hurt,</p>
<p>And liberates beings from suffering.</p>
<p>“He shows the safe, straight path</p>
<p>That leads to nirvāṇa</p>
<p>To blinded beings</p>
<p>And foolish ones treading wrong paths.</p>
<p>“Humans burnt by desire and hatred</p>
<p>And inflamed by delusion—</p>
<p>The Great Muni pacifies them</p>
<p>Just as a large cloud causes rain.</p>
<p>“There are none equal to him,</p>
<p>Who possesses excellent appearance, complexion, and power.</p>
<p>His strong body, which is imbued with supreme power,</p>
<p>Is well established just like a rocky mountain.</p>
<p>“He is not polluted by acquisition or nonacquisition,</p>
<p>Pleasure or suffering, blame or praise,</p>
<p>Honor or dishonor,</p>
<p>Just as the lotus blossom is not polluted by water.</p>
<p>“He abstains from killing.</p>
<p>He does not desire what is not given.</p>
<p>Speaking truth, leading a pure life,</p>
<p>He is free from backbiting.</p>
<p>“He does not speak coarse words</p>
<p>But speaks gently, in a timely way.</p>
<p>He does not seek the objects of desire</p>
<p>But has thoughts of love for people.</p>
<p>“He is perfect in seeing correctly</p>
<p>And exercises the power of meditation.</p>
<p>This great meditator with the six kinds of supernormal knowledge</p>
<p>Courses through the sky with his magical power.</p>
<p>“He hears the voices</p>
<p>Of various gods and humans</p>
<p>And also knows others’ minds,</p>
<p>Whether they are impure or good.</p>
<p>“He knows past lives,</p>
<p>Where he once lived,</p>
<p>And knows beings’ comings and goings,</p>
<p>That is, death and birth.</p>
<p>“Having had his impurities exhausted, not retaining any of them,</p>
<p>Pacified and emancipated,</p>
<p>With his faculties and mind pacified,</p>
<p>He is just like a still pond full of water.</p>
<p>“If you see him, who is like an excellent sixty-year-old elephant</p>
<p>In a lotus pond,</p>
<p>You, brahmin, who are insatiable,</p>
<p>Will attain joy.</p>
<p>“Śaila, the Blessed One is such a one.</p>
<p>His body bears the thirty-two marks</p>
<p>Of a great man,</p>
<p>And his splendor is like a mass of fire.</p>
<p>“Even if someone praised</p>
<p>The Protector for a hundred years,</p>
<p>He would not reach the end</p>
<p>Because the Tathāgata is immeasurable.</p>
<p>“Brahmin, those who see him</p>
<p>Attain supreme merit.</p>
<p>And those who see him and seek refuge in him</p>
<p>Attain merit superior to that.”</p>
<p>Having heard this praise of the Great Muni,</p>
<p>The ṛṣi Śaila was moved</p>
<p>And said to Kaineya,</p>
<p>His mind seeking solitude,</p>
<p>“I have never heard</p>
<p>Such praise of a human being.</p>
<p>O Kaineya, according to your explanation,</p>
<p>He is the best in the whole world.”</p>
<p>“Just like a merchant seeking wealth,</p>
<p>You should abandon the banner of pride.</p>
<p>Respect and worship him</p>
<p>And thus, brahmin, you will attain joy.”</p>
<p>Served by five hundred young brahmins</p>
<p>Who were his pupils,</p>
<p>The brahmin Śaila went</p>
<p>To the pleasant place of the Buddha’s sojourn.</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahmin entered</p>
<p>The dwelling of the king of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Which was abundant in trees bearing blossoms</p>
<p>Just like the gods’ Nandana Grove,</p>
<p>Which was solitary and quiet</p>
<p>And visited by flocks of birds,</p>
<p>And which was not haunted by harmful kinnarīs</p>
<p>But was visited by sons of the Śākyans.</p>
<p>Having seen the most excellent man,</p>
<p>The one who trains those who have not been trained,</p>
<p>Śaila spoke these words:</p>
<p>“Sir, are you free from illness?”</p>
<p>The Buddha, who had a pleasant voice like the kalaviṅka bird,</p>
<p>Answered Śaila</p>
<p>With sweet and clear words:</p>
<p>“Indeed, I am free from illness.</p>
<p>“Free from stains or evils,</p>
<p>Having cut off all uncertainty,</p>
<p>Liberated, possessed of nothing,</p>
<p>I am untainted and free from rigidity.</p>
<p>“Free from dust, I wander the world.</p>
<p>I am pure, clean, and taintless.</p>
<p>Thus, brahmin, I am pure</p>
<p>And have overcome all anger and fear.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Śaila.</p>
<p>Sit down on this seat.</p>
<p>Brahmin, are you happy?</p>
<p>Is your body not tired?”</p>
<p>“I am happy today because,</p>
<p>O Great Hero, I see you, Great Muni.</p>
<p>My heart is delighted</p>
<p>As if bedecked with adornments.”</p>
<p>Having exchanged the proper</p>
<p>Series of pleasantries with him,</p>
<p>The brahmin then sat down,</p>
<p>His mind humble and modest.</p>
<p>Having sat down, the brahmin Śaila,</p>
<p>Who was a holder of recitations and mantras</p>
<p>And was familiar with the three kinds of Vedic knowledge,</p>
<p>Observed the Muni’s marks.</p>
<p>He saw thirty marks</p>
<p>On the body of the Protector of the World.</p>
<p>Śaila had doubts about the other two,</p>
<p>Namely, the narrow tongue and the private part hidden in a sheath.</p>
<p>Having become uncertain and unsettled</p>
<p>About the marks of the Great Muni,</p>
<p>He asked the Perfectly Awakened One,</p>
<p>The descendant of the sun, whose name was truth,</p>
<p>“The marks of a Great Muni</p>
<p>Are thirty-two.</p>
<p>I have not seen, O Gautama,</p>
<p>Two of them on your body.</p>
<p>“O best of men, is your private part</p>
<p>Hidden in a sheath?</p>
<p>Is your tongue, which is praised as excellent,</p>
<p>Really long?</p>
<p>“O Great Muni, by all means</p>
<p>I must be convinced of your long tongue.</p>
<p>Please dart your narrow tongue out of your mouth</p>
<p>And clear up my doubts.</p>
<p>“It is seldom that Guides</p>
<p>Appear in the world.</p>
<p>A Great Muni is scarcely met,</p>
<p>Just like the udumbara flower.</p>
<p>“We serve the Teacher</p>
<p>Just as thirsty ones seek water in summer,</p>
<p>Hungry ones food,</p>
<p>And sick ones medicines.”</p>
<p>The Buddha, who has the melodious voice of a kalaviṅka bird,</p>
<p>Answered Śaila</p>
<p>With sweet and clear words:</p>
<p>“Brahmin, remove your uncertainty.”</p>
<p>He covered his whole face</p>
<p>With his long tongue,</p>
<p>So that the tongue</p>
<p>Covered his eyes and ears.</p>
<p>And when he, who is skilled in four kinds of magical power,</p>
<p>Displayed it with his magical power,</p>
<p>The brahmin Śaila saw</p>
<p>The Muni’s private part hidden in a sheath.</p>
<p>When he was freed from such doubts</p>
<p>About the Great Muni’s marks, and his distress was gone,</p>
<p>Śaila’s mind was pleased</p>
<p>And he uttered the following words:</p>
<p>“I have learned from the mantra teachings</p>
<p>Of the thirty-two marks.</p>
<p>All of them appear here on your body,</p>
<p>Perfectly, nothing lacking.</p>
<p>“Virtuous, excellent in conduct,</p>
<p>Well born, pleasant to behold,</p>
<p>You are beautiful just like the sun,</p>
<p>In the middle of the community of disciples.</p>
<p>“What use is the state of a śramaṇa</p>
<p>For you, who are the most praised?</p>
<p>A man like you, bull among men,</p>
<p>Is suitable to be a wheel-turning king,</p>
<p>“Possessor of seven treasures</p>
<p>And an army consisting of four divisions.</p>
<p>Be the master of the earth, a king,</p>
<p>And turn the chakra over the earth!”</p>
<p>“Śaila, I am a king—that is,</p>
<p>The supreme great king of the Dharma.</p>
<p>I turn the chakra of the Dharma</p>
<p>Over this entire earth.</p>
<p>“My family is kṣatriya.</p>
<p>I was born into a family of virtue.</p>
<p>Having defeated Māra with his army,</p>
<p>I attained the most excellent, perfect awakening.</p>
<p>“Brahmin, my mindfulness is a chakra.</p>
<p>My wisdom is a minister.</p>
<p>A swift horse, which is effort,</p>
<p>Spurred, trots forth delightedly.</p>
<p>“My best jewel is meditation,</p>
<p>Which illuminates the darkness.</p>
<p>Equanimity is the best elephant, which,</p>
<p>Urged on, runs delightedly.</p>
<p>“Just as women are a pleasure for enamored ones,</p>
<p>Brahmin, joy is my pleasure.</p>
<p>Brahmin, my householder is</p>
<p>The fully purified state, which is the best wealth.</p>
<p>“With my seven limbs of awakening,</p>
<p>These treasures that surpass the entire world,</p>
<p>I will awaken these humans</p>
<p>Who are blind and asleep.</p>
<p>“As I have conquered every direction,</p>
<p>There are none who match me.</p>
<p>The four groups of followers,</p>
<p>Who conquer the mass of defilements, are my children.</p>
<p>“In the city visited by ancient buddhas,</p>
<p>Which is furnished with a park, which is magical power,</p>
<p>In which a crossroads, which is the path, has been built</p>
<p>And sūtras and jātakas are scattered,</p>
<p>Which is visited by great men,</p>
<p>“Which is equipped with the three gates of liberation</p>
<p>And guarded by guards who are mindfulness,</p>
<p>Which fully possesses conscience and a sense of shame,</p>
<p>I, the Tathāgata, the king, dwell.</p>
<p>“I fought the battle of the Dharma.</p>
<p>Beating the drum of the Dharma,</p>
<p>I defeated all Māras.</p>
<p>I was anointed as a king for the purpose of awakening.</p>
<p>“The immeasurable states of mind, practiced well,</p>
<p>Are my adornments.</p>
<p>The four pure abodes</p>
<p>Prevent defilements.</p>
<p>“Having defeated, destroyed,</p>
<p>And scattered other teachings,</p>
<p>I behave rightly,</p>
<p>Giving light to beings in this world.</p>
<p>“Maintaining a blissful state,</p>
<p>I cut with the sword of wisdom.</p>
<p>I stand on the base of magical power,</p>
<p>And cessation is my clenched fist.</p>
<p>“Conduct is my chariot, which makes a pleasing sound,</p>
<p>And my observation is a charioteer.</p>
<p>Clad in armor, which is patience and gentleness,</p>
<p>I go to the battlefield by practicing the path.</p>
<p>“With a quiver,</p>
<p>Which is the five faculties that destroy obstacles,</p>
<p>And the four kinds of correct relinquishment,</p>
<p>Which kill defilements,</p>
<p>“I fought a heroic battle.</p>
<p>Having beaten the drum of the Dharma,</p>
<p>And having defeated Māra with his army,</p>
<p>I was anointed as a king for awakening.</p>
<p>“Having defeated ignorance with knowledge,</p>
<p>I crossed the front line of battle,</p>
<p>Where the five aggregates arise and cease.</p>
<p>I was awakened for the awakening of beings.</p>
<p>“Since I have completely defeated</p>
<p>The worst three thieves in the world</p>
<p>Disturbing humans,</p>
<p>Who are desire, hatred, and delusion,</p>
<p>“The power of all supernormal knowledge has arisen in me.</p>
<p>I am an arhat, who is suitable to be a field of merit,</p>
<p>Recipient of offerings</p>
<p>That have grown in a good field.</p>
<p>“Having made the best effort,</p>
<p>I defeated impurities.</p>
<p>Having crossed the great flood,</p>
<p>I remain to allow others to cross.”</p>
<p>“Just as a lion with powerful fangs,</p>
<p>When it meets other beings in the forest,</p>
<p>Whether they are small, medium, or large,</p>
<p>Pounces on them equally,</p>
<p>“The lion among humans, the Leader,</p>
<p>The Perfectly Awakened One in the world,</p>
<p>Equally shows the Dharma</p>
<p>To those who are immature, middling, and great.</p>
<p>“O Gautama, here may you</p>
<p>Remove my uncertainties, I who am sick!</p>
<p>The best of those who remove pain,</p>
<p>Those who perform surgery, is you.”</p>
<p>“Remove your uncertainties!</p>
<p>Brahmin, you should be zealous.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see</p>
<p>Celebrated perfectly awakened ones.</p>
<p>“The Perfectly Awakened One,</p>
<p>Who is difficult to meet and appears very rarely,</p>
<p>Is me, brahmin;</p>
<p>I am the supreme king of the Dharma.”</p>
<p>Śaila said to the Tathāgata,</p>
<p>“O Gautama, if you say</p>
<p>That you are the Perfectly Awakened One</p>
<p>And you turn the chakra everywhere,</p>
<p>“Who is the general,</p>
<p>The disciple born from the Teacher himself,</p>
<p>Who wisely turns the chakra once turned by you</p>
<p>As you taught?”</p>
<p>“Brahmin, I have a disciple,</p>
<p>A son, who is equal to me in wisdom:</p>
<p>The well-learned Śāriputra,</p>
<p>Also called Upatiṣya.</p>
<p>“He is liberated from all the knots,</p>
<p>Peaceful, free from impurities.</p>
<p>Being wise, he turns</p>
<p>The chakra I have turned.”</p>
<p>“How wonderful the Buddha and the Dharma are!</p>
<p>How wonderful the perfection of the disciples is!</p>
<p>How wonderful the most excellent three treasures are!</p>
<p>A great marvel has appeared in the world.</p>
<p>“Excellent One, approved as</p>
<p>A disciple of yours,</p>
<p>I will drink the essence of the Dharma—how great!—</p>
<p>And successfully become emancipated.”</p>
<p>After his mind was pleased,</p>
<p>Then the brahmin became stirred up.</p>
<p>He said to his attendants,</p>
<p>With his mind seeking solitude,</p>
<p>“Listen, sirs, to the words</p>
<p>That the great meditator,</p>
<p>The remover of pain, the seer, has given,</p>
<p>Just as a lion roars in the forest.</p>
<p>“Those who wish should follow me;</p>
<p>Those who do not should leave.</p>
<p>I will go forth today</p>
<p>In the teachings of the possessor of the most excellent wisdom.</p>
<p>“If one leads this pure life</p>
<p>And practices the path well,</p>
<p>His going forth will be fruitful</p>
<p>For himself, who practices carefulness.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to go forth</p>
<p>And be ordained,</p>
<p>O brahmin, we too will go forth,</p>
<p>Cutting off these locks of hair.”</p>
<p>With his mind pleased,</p>
<p>Making the gesture of supplication, his ten fingers joined,</p>
<p>With his upper robe draped over one shoulder,</p>
<p>The brahmin Śaila said,</p>
<p>“These five hundred young brahmins</p>
<p>Are making the gesture of supplication.</p>
<p>O Great Muni, we all wish to</p>
<p>Go forth and be ordained.”</p>
<p>Then, the merciful Teacher,</p>
<p>The compassionate great ṛṣi,</p>
<p>Said, “Come, monks!”</p>
<p>Thus they were ordained.</p>
<p>Śāriputra, whose wisdom was great,</p>
<p>Maudgalyāyana, who possessed magical power,</p>
<p>The elder Nandika Kapphiṇa,</p>
<p>Who was conversant in eloquence—</p>
<p>These elders skilled in eloquence</p>
<p>Instructed them</p>
<p>In the pleasant forest</p>
<p>On the bank of the Prabhadrikā River.</p>
<p>There, having learned from them the discourse of the Dharma</p>
<p>That was suitable for them,</p>
<p>The monks were soon liberated</p>
<p>And were established in the supreme goal.</p>
<p>Having seen such profit and become happy,</p>
<p>They were emancipated in those very lives.</p>
<p>Delighted, they worshiped</p>
<p>The Buddha, leader of the world.</p>
<p>They worshiped the excellent Dharma,</p>
<p>The best of assemblies, learning praised by the Victor,</p>
<p>Meditation, giving,</p>
<p>And carefulness.</p>
<p>Thus, those who wish for</p>
<p>Profit or majesty for themselves</p>
<p>Should honor the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community</p>
<p>And seek refuge in them.</p>
<p>These are praised by the Seer of the Truth</p>
<p>As the true refuges in the world.</p>
<p>They give every kind of happiness</p>
<p>To those who are frightened by harm.</p>
<p>Those who wish for liberation should always rely on</p>
<p>The greatest thing consistent with the Dharma,</p>
<p>Which is the teaching of the king of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Descendant of the sun, the Buddha.</p>
<p>The verses of Kaineya are completed.</p>
<p>II. The Town of Kāśi, Barley Porridge</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Kāśi, went to the town of Kāśi. In the town of Kāśi, there were a father and son who had originally been barbers but had gone forth. The son said, “Father, the Blessed One has come to the monastery, having traveled in the country of Kāśi with the community of his disciples. Since the Blessed One and the community of monks are fatigued, let us now invite the Blessed One and the community of his disciples for a meal of barley porridge. And so, will you prepare rice soup or invite the community of monks?”</p>
<p>“You should go and invite the community of monks,” said the father. “I will prepare rice soup.”</p>
<p>The son then invited the community of monks. The father went to the market, carrying a mirror with him. There he saw the head of a guild, who had long hair and a long beard. When he showed him the mirror, he asked, “O noble one, do you have such a skill?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” he answered.</p>
<p>“If you do, please shave me.”</p>
<p>When he began to shave him, the householder fell asleep and woke up when the shaving was done. “O noble one,” he asked, “have you finished shaving?”</p>
<p>“Yes, householder, I have.”</p>
<p>He was delighted and said, “O noble one, as I am quite completely satisfied, I will offer you what you most wish.”</p>
<p>He replied, “Since I have invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal of barley porridge, give me barley porridge.”</p>
<p>“Noble one, is such a thing as barley porridge suitable for you?” the householder asked. “I will offer you a fine meal. Go and invite them!”</p>
<p>Having saluted him, he departed.</p>
<p>Then the householder prepared a pure and fine meal . . . the Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. When the fine meal was distributed there, the monks wondered, “Since we have been invited for plain food, how can we accept this fine meal?” They did not accept it. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “If one is invited for plain food and obtains a fine meal, one can consume it. You should not have any doubts about this.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One thought, “The fault that occurred in this case was that monks retain tools related to their families. Thus, a monk should not demonstrate his skill. He should not keep tools related to his family, either. If he keeps them, he becomes guilty of an offense. There are exceptions: a former physician keeping a box of scalpels, a former scribe keeping an ink bottle, and a tailor keeping a needle case.”</p>
<p>III. Khādyaka in Pāpā</p>
<p>The Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, arrived at Pāpā and stayed in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā. There lived a maternal uncle of the venerable Ānanda, who was a high official of the Mallas named Roca. He was not very pious. When the Mallas in Pāpā heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, had arrived at Pāpā and was staying in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā,  they began to talk among themselves: “Sirs, we have heard that the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Malla, has arrived at Pāpā and is staying in the dense forest of Jalūkā near Pāpā. Since if each of us offers a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha, the others will not have any opportunity, let us make an agreement so that none of us will by himself offer a meal to the community of monks headed by the Buddha, but we will offer a meal together. If one of us offers a meal by himself, a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed on him by our community.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the Mallas of Pāpā went to the Blessed One together. When they arrived, they bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, and then they sat down to one side. When they had sat down to one side, the Blessed One, through talk consistent with the Dharma . . . delighted the Mallas of Pāpā, and then remained silent.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Mallas of Pāpā rose from their seats, draped their upper robes over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to our offer of a meal at one of our houses tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the Mallas of Pāpā by remaining silent. Then the Mallas of Pāpā, knowing that the Blessed One had assented by remaining silent, praised and were delighted at the words of the Blessed One, bowed low until their foreheads touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from their seats, and departed.</p>
<p>Roca, the high official of the Mallas, remained there. The venerable Ānanda asked him, “Roca,  have you become pious?”</p>
<p>“I have not become pious,” he answered, “but our community made an agreement . . . a fine of sixty kārṣāpaṇas shall be imposed.”</p>
<p>“You came to see the Blessed One for fear of a fine!”</p>
<p>“O honored one, precisely so.”</p>
<p>The venerable Ānanda then took Roca, the high official of the Mallas, to the Blessed One. Upon their arrival, he said to the Blessed One, “O Honored One, this Roca, the high official of the Mallas, does not believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, or the community. May the Blessed One preach the Dharma well so that he will believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community.”</p>
<p>The Blessed One assented to the venerable Ānanda by remaining silent. Then the Blessed One preached the Dharma to Roca, the high official of the Mallas, so that after listening to it, he would believe in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community. Thereupon Roca, the high official of the Mallas, rose from his seat, draped his upper robe over one shoulder, made the gesture of supplication to the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One, “May the Blessed One together with the community of monks assent to my offer of a meal at my house tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Roca, I have already been invited by the Mallas of Pāpā.”</p>
<p>“May the Blessed One assent, and I will make the Mallas of Pāpā allow this.”</p>
<p>“Roca, if the Mallas of Pāpā allow it, I will thus assent to you.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Roca, the high official of the Mallas, bowed low until his forehead touched the Blessed One’s feet, rose from his seat, departed, and went to see the Mallas of Pāpā. When he arrived, he said to the Mallas of Pāpā, “Sirs,  wait for a while. It will not cause difficulty if I first offer a meal to the Blessed One and the community of monks, and later you also offer a meal to them.”</p>
<p>“We invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha first,” they replied. “We do not consent to this.”</p>
<p>“If you do not allow this,” he countered, “I will distribute khādyaka and drinks respectively.”</p>
<p>Those who were impious there said, “We do not permit this.”</p>
<p>Those who were pious said, “Sirs, since he, being impious, will give offerings to the community, we will give him permission to do so.” Then they did give him permission.</p>
<p>He then called together some cooks. “Sirs,” he instructed them, “I will provide every ingredient, so prepare khādyaka with which one would be fully satisfied.” He gave them ingredients including various fragrant materials, and they cooked khādyaka with various fragrances, each serving of which would fully satisfy each person.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Mallas of Pāpā prepared a pure and fine meal during the night . . . . The Blessed One sat on the seat prepared for him in front of the community of monks. Then Roca, the high official of the Mallas, began to distribute khādyaka and drinks, but the monks did not eat because of some doubts. The Blessed One said, “You should ask for the donor’s consent.”</p>
<p>The monks asked for the consent of the Mallas of Pāpā. “O noble ones,” they said, “we were deceived by Roca, the high official of the Mallas. Please receive it anyway.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Roca, the high official of the Mallas, distributed khādyaka, and the monks were fully satisfied with it. Since the Blessed One had assigned the rewards of the offerings and departed, the food provided by the Mallas of Pāpā was not consumed.</p>
<p>IV. Doubts</p>
<p>On another day,  when monks went for alms, brahmins and householders said, “O Buddha, please come! O Dharma, please come! O community, please come! Accept this!”</p>
<p>The monks did not accept it because of some doubts. The Blessed One told them, “You should ask, ‘Are you giving it to me or the Blessed One, the best of humans?’ If they say, ‘This is for the Blessed One, the best of humans,’ you should not have it for yourselves. But if they say, ‘Our Buddha is none but you,’ you can accept it. You should not have any regrets about this. Likewise, you should ask, ‘Is this for the Dharma, the best of what is free from desire?’ ‘For the community, the best of assemblies?’ . . . .”</p>
<p>V. Foul Foods</p>
<p>A. A Story of the Present about the Great Peacock Charm</p>
<p>The following took place in Śrāvastī.</p>
<p>A certain householder invited the community of monks headed by the Buddha to a steam bath. At that time, a venerable one named Svāti, who was young, junior, and in his youth, who had newly gone forth and newly been ordained, newly come into this Dharma and Vinaya, thought, “The Blessed One said, ‘Those who give a little, those who give much, those who give excellent things, those who do labor with pleasure, those who are satisfied with a pure mind—all of them share merit.’ So, I will now do labor.” He began to chop wood. Then a poisonous snake emerged from a hole in a rotten piece of wood and bit him on the right big toe. He fainted from the poison, fell on the ground, and foamed at the mouth, his face and eyes distorted.</p>
<p>Brahmins and householders saw him suffering in such pain and asked each other, “Sirs, which householder’s son is this?”</p>
<p>Some of them answered, “He is So-and-so’s son.”</p>
<p>They said, “He went forth among those who are helpless, those śramaṇas who are the sons of the Śākyans.  If he had not gone forth, his family would have treated him.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Ask a physician what to do and treat him.”</p>
<p>The monks asked a physician what to do, and he answered, “Noble ones, give him some foul food.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “You can give it to him if the physician prescribed it.”</p>
<p>Because the monks did not know what foul food was, they asked the physician. He answered, “Noble ones, since your Teacher, the Blessed One, is omniscient, one who sees everything, he must know.”</p>
<p>When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Monks, the types of foul food are as follows: excrement, urine, ash, and soil. Among these, excrement is that of newly born calves. Urine is that of them too. Ash is that of five kinds of trees, namely, kāñcana, kapītaka, aśvattha, udumbara, and nyagrodha. The soil is that which is dug out from a depth of four fingers from the surface of the ground. These are the types of foul food.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the monks gave foul food to the venerable Svāti, but his health did not return. When the monks reported this matter to the Blessed One, the Blessed One said, “Ānanda, can you receive the Great Peacock Charm from me, learn it, protect, guard, and defend the monk Svāti, detoxify the poison, remove the harm, counteract the poison, establish a boundary, and bind the ground?”</p>
<p>“May the Blessed One say it. I will do as I hear.”</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One chanted this Great Peacock Charm: “Homage to the Buddha!  Homage to the Dharma! Homage to the community!</p>
<p>“It is like this: amale vimale nirmale maṅgale hiraṇye hiraṇye garbhe bhadre subhadre samanta­bhadre śrī­bhadre sarvārtha­sādhani paramārtha­sādhani sarvānartha­praśamani sarva­maṅgala­sādhani manasi mānasi mahā­mānasi acyute adbhute atyadbhute mukte mocani mokṣaṇi araje viraje amare amṛte amaraṇi brahme brahmāsvare pūrṇe pūrṇamanorathe mukte jīvante, protect Svāti from all harm, fear, and disease, svāhā!”</p>
<p>“Certainly, O Honored One.”</p>
<p>Thus, the venerable Ānanda received the Great Peacock Charm and gave a blessing to the monk Svāti, so that the poison disappeared and his health returned.</p>
<p>B. Stories of the Buddha’s Former Lives Related to the Great Peacock Charm</p>
<p>The monks, feeling doubtful, asked the Buddha, the Blessed One, the one who severs all doubts, for clarification, saying: “O Blessed One, it is a great wonder that the Blessed One’s Great Peacock Charm is so beneficial and useful.”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks, how, not only in the present but also in the past, when I was one whose body had descended to an unfortunate state of existence, the Great Peacock Charm, the Queen of Charms, was beneficial and useful.</p>
<p>“Monks, there once lived a peacock king named Suvarṇāvabhāsa on the southern slope of the Himalaya, the king of mountains. He gave a blessing to himself with this Great Peacock Charm every morning and spent the day, protected by the blessing, then gave a blessing in the evening and spent the night, protected by the blessing.</p>
<p>“One day, seized by a strong desire, indulging in the objects of desire, eager for them, intoxicated, stultified, and infatuated, he carelessly wandered together with many forest peahens from one park to another, from one garden to another, from one slope of the mountain to another. When he entered a certain mountain cave, he  was caught there by old enemies—foes and adversaries—watching by a peacock trap for an opportunity. Having fallen into his antagonists’ hands, he fainted but later came to himself and reflected upon this Great Peacock Charm, namely: Amale vimale nirmale maṅgale hiraṇye hiraṇye garbhe bhadre subhadre samanta­bhadre śrībhadre sarvārtha­sādhani paramārtha­sādhani sarvānartha­praśamani sarva­maṅgala­sādhani manasi mānasi mahā­mānasi acyute adbhute atyadbhute mukte mocani mokṣaṇi araje viraje amare amṛte amaraṇi brahme brahmāsvare pūrṇe pūrṇamanorathe mukte jīvante, protect me from every harm, svāhā!</p>
<p>He then broke the peacock trap and ran away.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who was that peacock king Suvarṇāvabhāsa at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. My Great Peacock Charm was beneficial and useful at that time. And it is beneficial and useful now, too.”</p>
<p>“See, O Honored One, how a blessing was given to the monk Svāti with the Blessed One’s charm.”</p>
<p>“Listen, monks, how, not only in the present but also in the past, it was so. Monks, once there was a snake charmer in the city of Vārāṇasī. A certain kṣatriya boy was bitten by a snake and died. The snake charmer revived him with this charm.</p>
<p>“What do you think, monks? The one who was that snake charmer at that time, on that occasion, was indeed me. The boy at that time, on that occasion, was indeed the monk Svāti.”</p>
