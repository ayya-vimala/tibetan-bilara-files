<h1>The Hundred and Eight Names of the Goddess Tārā</h1>
</header>
<p>Homage to the great goddess Tārā, the completely victorious jewel, who, with her exquisite necklace, garments, and lower robes, is a canopy for the great worldly realm.</p>
<p>At that time, the goddess Tārā uttered this supreme dhāraṇī, which had never been seen or heard before:</p>
<p>oṁ trailokyavijaya | acittajaya | aniracijataya | sujaya | vijaya | mahājaya | vijaya | jaya jaya | he he | smara smara | vara vara varada | mahādevi | vilasa | vilasa | vilasa | vaja amotakari vijayadevi | hī hī | kiṇi kiṇi vilambase | smara smara | mahāprajñā anipata | vajramahākāruṇika | bhagini hruṃ hruṃ | sphuṭa sphuṭa | sphoṭa sphoṭa | āveśaya āveśaya | dhuna dhuna | vidhuna vidhuna | kampa kampa | kampaya | surabhigandha | atisita | mukhe haladavala | saṃgarājana | vimavigi | vināśaya vināśaya | he bhagavati | santrāsaya vighanān | parivalāya asmākaṃ asmākaṃ | mādani mādani | saṃbodhaya | saṃmohaya | hara hara | hiri hiri | huru huru | vitakara | varaja | haṃ haṃ | trotāya | haṃ haṃ | santratāya | santroya | manta manta | marda marda | cara cara | saṃcara saṃcara | vega vega vegavati | namo namo namaḥ svāhā |</p>
<p>Upon hearing this great mantra,</p>
<p>Supremely renowned in the three realms,</p>
<p>The assemblies of gods and asuras,</p>
<p>Together with the hordes of rākṣasas,</p>
<p>Yakṣas, kinnaras, mahoragas,</p>
<p>Bhūtas, gandharvas, and vināyakas,</p>
<p>Grew afraid and hung their heads low.</p>
<p>With their mighty arms trembling, they said:</p>
<p>“Homage to you, Tārā, the broad-eyed one,</p>
<p>Who turns away the speech of Kāmadeva,</p>
<p>So that your names may fill the three realms!</p>
<p>“Proclaimer of Avalokiteśvara’s lineage,</p>
<p>Light renowned for its greatness, O broad-eyed one,</p>
<p>You came into being to help sentient beings!”</p>
<p>Then, all the gods and asuras,</p>
<p>Such as Śiva and the others, gathered together.</p>
<p>The lords among vidyādharas</p>
<p>And the vidyādharas themselves</p>
<p>Draped their upper garments across their shoulders,</p>
<p>Performed excellent circumambulations, and,</p>
<p>Bending their knees to the ground,</p>
<p>Spoke the following words:</p>
<p>“O Tārā, goddess of blazing light,</p>
<p>To you we pay homage! Homage! Homage to you!</p>
<p>Your hundred and eight peerless and pristine names</p>
<p>We will now recite:</p>
<p>“Glorious, exalted one, ever victorious and propitious,</p>
<p>Your extrasensory powers are as swift as Prajāpati’s.</p>
<p>Your fierceness instills fear in the Lord of Love,</p>
<p>Yet you are free of carelessness and conceit.</p>
<p>“Your eyes, face, and navel</p>
<p>Are lotus-like and exude purity.</p>
<p>Your broad, beautiful eyes glow blue</p>
<p>Like the blue of the utpala flower.</p>
<p>“You protect all those worthy of care,</p>
<p>Granting them happiness, strength, and beauty.</p>
<p>Protector and fierce guardian,</p>
<p>You enact the deeds of the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>“Your lips and fingernails shine red.</p>
<p>With bloodshot eyes you gaze.</p>
<p>Joyful, lotus-like force of joy,</p>
<p>You are the color of the lotus, in whose hues you delight!</p>
<p>“With your extraordinary strength and frightful attire</p>
<p>You tame and pacify the three worlds.</p>
<p>Subduer who acts to tame beings,</p>
<p>Noble one, you are praised as supreme among all.</p>
<p>“Holder of the vajra of resplendent clarity that tames beings,</p>
<p>Utterly victorious clear light,</p>
<p>You are awake, beyond taint or stain,</p>
<p>And you are honored by Candra and the outstanding gods.</p>
<p>“Your beautiful beams of light</p>
<p>Pervade all objects of desire.</p>
<p>Majestic in your battle with Varuṇa,</p>
<p>Supreme one, your mind is naturally expansive and pervasive.</p>
<p>“With your triple crown ornament, three belly folds, and three eyes</p>
<p>You clear away the three defilements.</p>
<p>Dispeller of phenomenal existence, lady of deep virtue,</p>
<p>You are also renowned for your eloquence.</p>
<p>“You grant victory and merit</p>
<p>And fearlessly vanquish evil.</p>
<p>Lady of peace who grants wealth and luster,</p>
<p>Your form, belly, and bosom are most elegant!</p>
<p>“Lady of illusion who tames the field of illusory displays,</p>
<p>You uphold discipline and dispel all impurity.</p>
<p>Holding a garland, you bring elation,</p>
<p>Grant exhilaration, and remove all conceit.</p>
<p>“Wrathful lady who inspires splendor,</p>
<p>White lady of bliss who brings peace,</p>
<p>Sovereign lady of all living beings, noble and mighty goddess,</p>
<p>You hold and bestow sacred knowledge.</p>
<p>“Your moon-like face glows with moonlight,</p>
<p>Stealing away the moon’s own effulgence.</p>
<p>Lady who delights in robbing the radiance of the sun,</p>
<p>You are beautiful, exalted, and wholly at peace!</p>
<p>“Blissful steppingstone to happiness,</p>
<p>You remove all that stands in the way of good fortune.</p>
<p>You make wealth increase and merit ever-victorious.</p>
<p>You gleam like gold and silver from the Jambu River.</p>
<p>“Dispeller of fears and bestower of fearlessness,</p>
<p>You are Tārā; your face is like the moon.</p>
<p>You never stray far from any sentient being.</p>
<p>You bring joy and are worthy of worship and homage.</p>
<p>“Your exalted garments glimmer with blue hues;</p>
<p>You are beautifully adorned with red ornaments;</p>
<p>And, like Gaṅgā, you dress in yellow clothing.</p>
<p>Blazing white lady, you are all-seeing!</p>
<p>“Fragrant as a ball of bezoar,</p>
<p>You are the adamantine Varuṇa and retinue.</p>
<p>Fearsome lady, queen of the supreme maṇḍala,</p>
<p>With your white teeth you laugh and smile.</p>
<p>“You wear armlets, earrings, and bracelets</p>
<p>And are wreathed in glimmering crystal necklaces.</p>
<p>Lady with a face of beauty, wearing a superb sash,</p>
<p>You are accompanied by the one who holds a sprig of neem leaves.</p>
<p>“You wear a jeweled diadem, hold a jewel,</p>
<p>And are adorned with jeweled ornaments.</p>
<p>You are adorned with a band of beautiful gems,</p>
<p>And sparkle like precious stones.</p>
<p>“Vajra lady, you radiate with blazing colors,</p>
<p>Awakening men and women both.</p>
<p>Fanged one who wields the rod of peace,</p>
<p>You are as strong as Brahmā and as swift as the wind.</p>
<p>“You are the woman who descends from the sky</p>
<p>And shines with the light of a supreme goddess.</p>
<p>Luminous one who conquers through desire,</p>
<p>You have vanquished the torment of desire.</p>
<p>“Wrathful one with a topknot and diadem, victorious one,</p>
<p>You are Brahmā and have the speech of Brahmā.</p>
<p>Your beautiful voice rings like the call of the kalaviṅka.</p>
<p>Sovereign of the world, you are born within the supreme family!</p>
<p>“Fierce lady adorned with the resplendence of jewels</p>
<p>And holding a staff with adamantine leaves,</p>
<p>Your immaculate earrings sway as you move.</p>
<p>Such is how you dawn in the minds of those in Yama’s realm.</p>
<p>“You are the one taking the form of a vidyādharī.</p>
<p>You are endowed with five strengths and bestow strength.</p>
<p>Wielding strength as well as absence of strength,</p>
<p>You cut with the blade of wisdom.</p>
<p>“You are crafty and full of art,</p>
<p>And your voice resounds mightily,</p>
<p>Like a bouquet of campaka flowers</p>
<p>Brightens a courtyard or hall from above.</p>
<p>Wrathful one, you hold a bouquet in your hand</p>
<p>And are an excellent support for yellow-clad monastics.</p>
<p>Fortunate one, you are decked in ornaments</p>
<p>And experience great delight.</p>
<p>“Vajra fury who brings joy,</p>
<p>You are endowed with the signs and great strength of your lineage.</p>
<p>With your bliss, intelligence, and adamantine means,</p>
<p>You bestow understanding and increase wisdom.</p>
<p>“Goddess of the resplendent diadem,</p>
<p>Your manner is greater than all the gods.</p>
<p>As Nārāyaṇī, you dispel negativity,</p>
<p>And you delight in auspiciousness and modesty.</p>
<p>“Lady of gladness, you delight all who associate with you</p>
<p>And you delight in those who delight in wholesome conduct.</p>
<p>Delightful lady who exudes delight,</p>
<p>You are an excellent support for all qualities.</p>
<p>“Lady who emanates buddha emanations,</p>
<p>And who works to dispel pride,</p>
<p>You destroy karma and afflictions,</p>
<p>And conquer all forms of desire.</p>
<p>“You are a buddha with the ten knowledges,</p>
<p>And you uphold the ten perfections.</p>
<p>You have reached the ten grounds,</p>
<p>And shine bright with the light of the ten strengths.</p>
<p>“You wear a vajra diadem and wield a vajra.</p>
<p>With your subtle vajra you clear away asuras.</p>
<p>With the vajra of time you bring elation,</p>
<p>And you wield the vajra hook of bliss and glory.</p>
<p>“Charming lady who holds a vajra in her hand</p>
<p>And wields a vajra lasso, an excellent lasso,</p>
<p>You are captivating; you bring satisfaction to the mind,</p>
<p>And you dispel all opponents and obstacle makers.</p>
<p>“You bring about contentment and great happiness,</p>
<p>And reveal the way of play and dance.</p>
<p>Rich in Dharma, you have the radiance of halāhala.</p>
<p>Giver of the Dharma, your gaze is vast.</p>
<p>“You are a vajra emanation,</p>
<p>And are said to be vajra nectar.</p>
<p>Great goddess, powerful with a blazing vajra,</p>
<p>To you we pay homage!</p>
<p>“With this praise of ours,</p>
<p>We recite your hundred and eight sublime names.</p>
<p>Amazing! The supreme Blessed One herself</p>
<p>Has spoken the most sublime of utterances.”</p>
<p>Then, the magnificent goddess Tārā,</p>
<p>Who is like the light of the moon</p>
<p>And blazes with radiance,</p>
<p>Revealed a smile and spoke:</p>
<p>“Maheśvara and the rest of you,</p>
<p>Listen now to my words.</p>
<p>Always be agreeable with everyone</p>
<p>As you strive to attain the ten strengths.</p>
<p>At all times, protect the great way</p>
<p>Of the thus-gone ones.</p>
<p>Keeping your minds on the path of peace,</p>
<p>You must cross over the unbearable ocean of cyclic existence,</p>
<p>Which is the source of great terrors</p>
<p>And is so difficult to ford.</p>
<p>Setting your mind upon the city of nirvāṇa,</p>
<p>You must strive for it and enter it.”</p>
<p>Then Tārā, whose face is as beautiful</p>
<p>As a garland of the sun’s blazing rays,</p>
<p>Spoke the following words</p>
<p>Like the rumbling thunder of the Thus-Gone One:</p>
<p>“O wonder! This excellent vidyāmantra of Tārā</p>
<p>Clears away all darkness,</p>
<p>Creates immense power and strength,</p>
<p>And cuts through all obscurations.</p>
<p>“This dhāraṇī, which brings so much joy,</p>
<p>Will not be heard by the masses</p>
<p>Who have not purified themselves</p>
<p>By cultivating inner confidence.</p>
<p>“This great samaya, the samaya of this vidyāmantra,</p>
<p>Will arise for those</p>
<p>Who have developed stable confidence,</p>
<p>From their prior efforts toward buddhahood.</p>
<p>“Whoever upholds this sublime, indestructible dhāraṇī-mantra,</p>
<p>Which quells all afflictions,</p>
<p>Eliminates all negativity,</p>
<p>And nurtures all beings—</p>
<p>Whoever, in meditative equipoise,</p>
<p>Hears it, reads it, or keeps it in mind—</p>
<p>Will accomplish all their aims</p>
<p>As was stated by the Self-Arisen One.</p>
<p>“They will be liberated from all affliction,</p>
<p>Become the most excellent of sentient beings,</p>
<p>And will be equal to the thus-gone ones</p>
<p>Who are immersed in knowledge of every world’s phenomena.</p>
<p>“Whoever chants these hundred and eight names</p>
<p>And praises Tārā’s moon-like face in this way</p>
<p>Will reach buddhahood itself.</p>
<p>They will accomplish all their aims</p>
<p>And gain control over kings, powerful people,</p>
<p>And any number of other beings.</p>
<p>“This praise, known as The Hundred and Eight Names of the Goddess Tārā with a Lovely Face,</p>
<p>Fills the many worlds</p>
<p>And dispels all afflictions and everything untoward!</p>
<p>“Her body, which is like the supreme mountain of thus-gone ones,</p>
<p>Shakes the mountain ascended by the clans of māras.</p>
<p>She is the light that fully awakens gods and humans.</p>
<p>“This eminent one is renowned for her profound dedication</p>
<p>To the great collection of well-spoken teachings</p>
<p>Ceaselessly transmitted by the most eminent of the Victor’s heirs</p>
<p>Through their stability in the unique powers.</p>
<p>Appearing for the benefit of all, she condenses this Dharma,</p>
<p>And thus expertly soothes the fevers of the mind.”</p>
<p>After these words that dispel unbearable afflictions,</p>
<p>And which produce a tranquil mind,</p>
<p>Were spoken by the supreme Victor,</p>
<p>Tārā remained still and did not speak further.</p>
<p>Astonished and enraptured by the sublime goddess Tārā,</p>
<p>The entire assembly of devas and asuras was filled with joy and wonder</p>
<p>Upon hearing these instructive words that evoke deep joy and grant happiness and long life.</p>
<p>Overjoyed, they joined their hands above their heads as their speech was stilled.</p>
<p>This completes the dhāraṇī named “Supreme Tārā, the Hundred and Eight Names of the Goddess Tārā.”</p>
