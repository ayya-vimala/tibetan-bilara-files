<h1>The Glorious King of Tantras</h1>
</header>
<p>Equal to the Sky</p>
<p>Homage to the Glorious Great Well-Gone One!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the bhaga of the vajra queen—the awakened body, speech, and mind of all thus-gone ones. At that time, present among the assembly were the sky-dwelling, earth-dwelling, and subterranean ḍākinīs. Smiling at these three, the Blessed One gave this teaching on the secret topic:</p>
<p>With faith, compassion, and a one-pointed mind,</p>
<p>Fix your body and your speech; set your mind toward others’ benefit.</p>
<p>Endeavoring toward fearless yogic discipline,</p>
<p>With zeal for the profound path—listen well!</p>
<p>Ḍākinīs, to you I will explain</p>
<p>Your distinctive characteristics.</p>
<p>Sky dweller is the winds of the upper gate.</p>
<p>Earth dweller is the drops of the middle gate.</p>
<p>Subterranean dweller is the lower gate of śukra.</p>
<p>These three gates are awakened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>First, the distinctive characteristics of the sky-dwelling ḍākinī</p>
<p>Should be known as being of three types:</p>
<p>The physical wind, the cognitive wind,</p>
<p>And the wisdom wind, which has the quality of all.</p>
<p>To elaborate on this brief explanation in sequence:</p>
<p>The nondual wind is neither male nor female.</p>
<p>When in union, it is the wind of method and wisdom.</p>
<p>When it flows upward and enters, it is awakened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>It then spreads throughout the body: the heart, sacrum,</p>
<p>Mouth, throat, and navel.</p>
<p>The five families’ winds then abide all-pervasively.</p>
<p>The physical wind has four circulatory movements.</p>
<p>Divided into pure or defiled, there are a total of eight.</p>
<p>Each of these corresponds to one of eight three-hour periods.</p>
<p>Each three-hour period can be divided into two circulations.</p>
<p>The circulations of wind are sixteen in number.</p>
<p>Each circulation takes two hours.</p>
<p>In each hour, there are two daṇḍas.</p>
<p>In terms of the winds, the daṇḍas number sixty-four.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are thirty-two hours,</p>
<p>Which can be divided into twenty-one thousand six hundred and so forth.</p>
<p>These winds are a mix of mental and nonmental.</p>
<p>In its coarse and subtle aspects,</p>
<p>The wise should take hold of the mount of the mind,</p>
<p>The steed of the mind—concepts of grasper and grasped.</p>
<p>When these two—grasper and grasped—have ceased, the winds come to rest at the center.</p>
<p>By itself, this is the wind of vajra wisdom.</p>
<p>When divided it has two aspects, method and wisdom.</p>
<p>It is the nature of the sky-dwelling ḍākinī.</p>
<p>This should be studied by those who know the pith instructions.</p>
<p>By means of their qualities, faults, and indications,</p>
<p>One must know the distinctive characteristics of the winds,</p>
<p>Along with all their supports.</p>
<p>There is the “curved one” along with the one on the left.</p>
<p>These have the shape of a bow.</p>
<p>They are the paths of the physical wind.</p>
<p>Through the paths of direct sensory perceptions,</p>
<p>One should strive diligently to understand</p>
<p>The various geographical features—Mount Sumeru and the four continents;</p>
<p>The sun and moon in the north and west, orbiting to the south;</p>
<p>The cycling of method and wisdom, and so forth—</p>
<p>These are stabilized by the physical wind.</p>
<p>Due to the cataracts of ignorance,</p>
<p>The jewel of the mind has become stained.</p>
<p>This is the conceptual wind;</p>
<p>This wind is itself the path.</p>
<p>There are the right channel and left channel,</p>
<p>Their forms similar to a coiled snake.</p>
<p>For one who focuses on yoga,</p>
<p>The conceptual winds cease in their place.</p>
<p>Self-awareness, which is primordially unarisen,</p>
<p>Is itself the wind of vajra wisdom.</p>
<p>Supported by the channel in the center,</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī is like its chariot.</p>
<p>The domain of its activity is the wisdom of self-awareness.</p>
<p>One who strives to remain there will apprehend self-awareness.</p>
<p>Because the sky-dwelling ḍākinī has the nature of these winds,</p>
<p>They are themselves the vajra path.</p>
<p>Next, I will explain the earth-dwelling ḍākinī.</p>
<p>One who desires the wisdom of self-awareness</p>
<p>Should investigate the divisions of caṇḍālī.</p>
<p>First is the natural caṇḍālī.</p>
<p>Second is the inner heat caṇḍālī.</p>
<p>Third is the caṇḍālī of union.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is the naked caṇḍālī.</p>
<p>These categories are also subdivided as follows:</p>
<p>There are naked inner heat, extreme inner heat,</p>
<p>And the perfect inner heat of union with another.</p>
<p>These should be applied to all the above categories.</p>
<p>There are naked, very naked, very nakedly naked, and so forth;</p>
<p>All of these should be applied to each.</p>
<p>Divided, there are twelve aspects</p>
<p>And branches, forty-eight in number.</p>
<p>This is the nature of earth-dwelling ḍākinī,</p>
<p>Seventy-two thousand, and so forth.</p>
<p>Mere fierce fire produced from elsewhere</p>
<p>Is the antithesis of this subtle inner heat.</p>
<p>The tips of one hundred twenty hairs</p>
<p>And the tips of thirty-two hairs,</p>
<p>The five pairs and the three main ones:</p>
<p>The place where these three unite is the size of a mustard seed.</p>
<p>The relative widths of the central, right, and left,</p>
<p>And the twofold distinctions should all be known.</p>
<p>There are places where they naturally reside</p>
<p>As channels that are clear, and those that are impure.</p>
<p>Also, the channel knots, similar to letters:</p>
<p>These are known as the primordial sound.</p>
<p>They are the nature of the earth-dwelling ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Learn their locations and so forth from other sources.</p>
<p>These instructions are a precious jewel;</p>
<p>Everything arises in dependence on them.</p>
<p>There are mistaken lineages, mistaken placements, and mistaken measurements,</p>
<p>Shapes, colors, numbers, and so forth.</p>
<p>There is no attainment from mistakes.</p>
<p>The nature, which is free from those mistakes,</p>
<p>Is the attainment of the earth-dwelling ḍākinī.</p>
<p>She is the support for them all.</p>
<p>Next, the nature of the subterranean ḍākinī</p>
<p>Will be correctly and excellently explained.</p>
<p>There are three types of awakening mind.</p>
<p>The first is the suchness mind.</p>
<p>This is beyond the scope of expressible knowledge.</p>
<p>The second is the self-aware awakening mind.</p>
<p>Like a crystal, its appearance is conditioned.</p>
<p>The third is the physical awakening mind;</p>
<p>Sandalwood and camphor.</p>
<p>These are described in two ways: ultimate and conventional.</p>
<p>What moves by way of karmic winds and karmic fires</p>
<p>Is conventional awakening mind.</p>
<p>What moves by way of wisdom winds and wisdom fires</p>
<p>Is the ultimate awakening mind.</p>
<p>They have these stages, pure and impure.</p>
<p>They should be distinguished</p>
<p>Through shapes and through colors.</p>
<p>Not moving through the karmic winds,</p>
<p>Not burning through the karmic fires,</p>
<p>Its attributes are similar to snow;</p>
<p>The indestructible drop has the form of haṁ.</p>
<p>Like a jasmine-colored gem,</p>
<p>Glossy-white and resplendent,</p>
<p>It arises as the body of great bliss.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate awakening mind.</p>
<p>As for the red one, naturally clear,</p>
<p>There are four common distinctions.</p>
<p>These are wisdom, awakening mind,</p>
<p>And the two inferior ones, which are their opposites.</p>
<p>The latter two abide at the lower door; they give rise to cyclic existence</p>
<p>When they are spurred to movement through negative conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the attributes of the drops</p>
<p>Must be known in their ultimate and their conventional aspects.</p>
<p>There is no attainment from mistaken causes,</p>
<p>Nor, likewise, from mistaken conditions.</p>
<p>These can be known from the teacher’s words.</p>
<p>The ultimate is not an object engaged by the mind.</p>
<p>The conventional has the feeling of bliss as its object.</p>
<p>Its nature is the subterranean ḍākinī.</p>
<p>She is the unshakable meditation on the three vajras.</p>
<p>She, herself, is Vajrasattva.</p>
<p>The meaning of the letters, the branches,</p>
<p>The condensed meanings, the general meaning,</p>
<p>The hidden meaning, and the ultimate meaning;</p>
<p>The varieties of conventional phenomena</p>
<p>Arise from the mind. Like a jewel and like a cymbal,</p>
<p>The varieties of ultimate phenomena</p>
<p>Arise on the basis of nonconceptual awareness.</p>
<p>The āli and kāli, along with the neuter phonemes,</p>
<p>Should be analyzed through these six modes.</p>
<p>The letter marking the final sound is inconceivable.</p>
<p>There are three types of branch:</p>
<p>Cause and result, signifier and signified,</p>
<p>And expression and expressed.</p>
<p>To briefly explain their opposites:</p>
<p>There are three vehicles; the rest is the mundane.</p>
<p>These should be understood as common.</p>
<p>These divisions should be known for oneself.</p>
<p>The hidden comprises the classifications of initiations and mantras.</p>
<p>There are four types of mantra and two kinds of initiation.</p>
<p>Dharmas are of two types, general and particular.</p>
<p>All these attributes</p>
<p>Should be known from the mouth of the guru.</p>
<p>The types of fit and unfit vessels</p>
<p>Should also be well analyzed by the guru.</p>
<p>When suchness is correctly realized,</p>
<p>There is no teacher, and nothing is taught.</p>
<p>Concentration and so forth become unceasing,</p>
<p>And buddhas arise in various forms.</p>
<p>They turn the various wheels of the Dharma,</p>
<p>Performing the twelve deeds and so forth.</p>
<p>For the lesser disciples, there is Action Tantra.</p>
<p>For the rest, there is Actionless Yoga.</p>
<p>After that, Yoga is also taught.</p>
<p>Inner yoga is for the rest.</p>
<p>After that there is Yoginī Tantra.</p>
<p>Using the churning stick of method and insight,</p>
<p>With the essence of wisdom at its tip,</p>
<p>The nondual awakened mind is churned;</p>
<p>From it comes nectar of twenty-four tastes.</p>
<p>This is known as the flow of precious jewels.</p>
<p>From this, all mundane and supramundane</p>
<p>Attainments will arise.</p>
<p>Just as unchurned milk</p>
<p>Will not give rise to what is desired,</p>
<p>Likewise, neither from many years of effort,</p>
<p>Nor suddenly, will attainments arise.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are twenty-four jewels,</p>
<p>Which taste like nectar and have the form of a lion.</p>
<p>Their sacred sites are also twenty-four,</p>
<p>Blessed by awakened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>Entrusted to twenty-four ḍākinīs,</p>
<p>They were sealed with four seals,</p>
<p>Carefully concealed and carefully disseminated.</p>
<p>If the seals are broken, the sacred vows are corrupted.</p>
<p>The natures of the mantras, visualized forms, and realizations</p>
<p>Are the natures of awakened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>These are constantly misconstrued as having an essence.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of mantra, two kinds of realization.</p>
<p>Visualized forms should be similarly understood in two ways.</p>
<p>The classifications and the divisions</p>
<p>Of each should be learned from the guru.</p>
<p>Outer, inner, hidden, and final—</p>
<p>These are the four seals of all tantras.</p>
<p>This classification should be analyzed by the wise.</p>
<p>When these are understood,</p>
<p>The yogi possesses tantra,</p>
<p>And hindrances are transcended.</p>
<p>This is natural caṇḍālī.</p>
<p>There are twenty-four sacred sites,</p>
<p>Blessed by the three channels.</p>
<p>In these twenty-four sacred sites,</p>
<p>To twenty-four ḍākinīs, twenty-four tantras were entrusted:</p>
<p>Puru—very fierce secret vajra.</p>
<p>Jaru—fierce eye, the secret is severed.</p>
<p>Oru—the bright one not pervaded by thought.</p>
<p>Āru—the tip of the nose is equal to space.</p>
<p>Goru—teaching the great space of the intellect.</p>
<p>Raru—the body, speech, and mind of a dwarf.</p>
<p>Deru—Laṅka, jewel garland.</p>
<p>Maru—dark woods, great vow.</p>
<p>Karueru—great power.</p>
<p>Oru—terrifying secret wisdom.</p>
<p>Triru—powerful winds, wisdom garland.</p>
<p>Koru—beer is consumed, wisdom blazes.</p>
<p>Karuśyāma—garland of the moon.</p>
<p>Laru—blazing with wealth and appeal.</p>
<p>Karu—horse-ear, the wheel of the sun.</p>
<p>Herukhakha—victorious wisdom.</p>
<p>Preru—secret place of ḍākinīs’ strength.</p>
<p>Grīrukhaṇḍa—secret, blazing with fire.</p>
<p>Saurushoṇḍi—secret nectar.</p>
<p>Suru—the wheel ornamented with a cemetery.</p>
<p>Naru—very heroic victorious vajra.</p>
<p>Siru—great power and victorious wisdom.</p>
<p>Maru—this area confers victory over attachment.</p>
<p>Kuru—enthusiastic ḍākinīs assemble.</p>
<p>These are the places of entrustment; they should be sought out well.</p>
<p>Regarding inner caṇḍālī, twenty-four were entrusted.</p>
<p>The first is secret, as is the second.</p>
<p>These are the nature. Next comes empowerment.</p>
<p>Last is conditions. So it was said.</p>
<p>These are the specific natures of the ḍākinīs.</p>
<p>Any desired attainments will be bestowed.</p>
<p>One who wants the supreme attainments</p>
<p>Should receive initiation and sacred vows.</p>
<p>With horses, elephants and so forth,</p>
<p>One’s children and wife,</p>
<p>One’s wealth and jewels,</p>
<p>One should honor and serve the guru.</p>
<p>From ra and li, which are the taste of nectar,</p>
<p>One attains realization from the instructions of the guru;</p>
<p>Remember to hold them in mind!</p>
<p>Following this discourse, all the gathered assemblies that were present rejoiced.</p>
<p>This completes the glorious king of tantras “Equal to the Sky,” which has the nature of  awakened body, speech, and mind.</p>
