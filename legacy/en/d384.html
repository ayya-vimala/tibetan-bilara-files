<h1>The Glorious King of Tantras That Resolves All Secrets</h1>
</header>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>I pay homage to Glorious Vajrasattva!</p>
<p>Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One dwelt in equanimity in the womb of the Vajra Lady, which is the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas.</p>
<p>Then, the entourage, including the bodhisattva Vajragarbha and others, performed three circumambulations counterclockwise, made outer, inner, and secret offerings, and asked the following:</p>
<p>“O Blessed Vajra Holder!</p>
<p>What is ‘secret’?</p>
<p>How is it resolved?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of ‘tantra’?</p>
<p>And what is its king?”</p>
<p>The First Secret</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“ ‘Secret’ is fourfold.</p>
<p>First is the practice of the development stage</p>
<p>Related to the vase initiation.</p>
<p>I taught meditation on the support and the supported</p>
<p>So that practitioners might relinquish</p>
<p>Dualistic concepts of a universe and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>“Its individual features all have an intended meaning.</p>
<p>Initially, in other tantras,</p>
<p>I taught about emptiness and so forth.</p>
<p>Among the particulars of the support and supported,</p>
<p>The first concerns the intention behind the support.</p>
<p>“Imagine that, like one candle lighting another,</p>
<p>The syllable hūṁ at the heart</p>
<p>Projects a black-hued e,</p>
<p>Which forms a vast, deep triangle.</p>
<p>“The three corners are enlightened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>This signifies the destruction of the three poisons.</p>
<p>The sides are the three liberations.</p>
<p>This signifies the destruction of the ten nonvirtues</p>
<p>That emerge from ordinary body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>“The dharma body is immaculate,</p>
<p>And therefore  naturally all-pervading.</p>
<p>This is the significance of vast.</p>
<p>“Since even the noble listeners, solitary realizers,</p>
<p>And bodhisattvas as well</p>
<p>Do not realize the dharma body,</p>
<p>It is explained with intention as deep.</p>
<p>“Then, again, the hūṁ at the heart</p>
<p>Projects a hūṁ syllable that forms into a vajra,</p>
<p>Which forms into a vajra tent.</p>
<p>“There are two obstacles: first, to life,</p>
<p>And second, to liberation.</p>
<p>These are the two obstructing forces,</p>
<p>The outer and the inner.</p>
<p>“The outer creates obstacles to life;</p>
<p>The inner creates obstacles to liberation.</p>
<p>The significance of the vajra tent</p>
<p>Is that it protects from these twofold obstructions.</p>
<p>“Then yaṁ, just as before,</p>
<p>Projects a shape like a half-moon.</p>
<p>It provides control over the abandonment of conceptuality</p>
<p>And the dawn of nonconceptuality.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of domination.</p>
<p>“Concerning the significance of the four flags,</p>
<p>I have taught that they signify all things</p>
<p>Present throughout the three times.</p>
<p>“The triangular fire maṇḍala from raṁ</p>
<p>Signifies wrathful ritual.</p>
<p>The three-pronged vajra signifies the three buddha bodies.</p>
<p>“The round water disk from baṁ</p>
<p>Is said to be the cessation of mental activity.</p>
<p>The vase is the four aspects of the dharma body.</p>
<p>“The square golden earth from laṁ</p>
<p>Has the nature of prosperity.</p>
<p>The five-pronged vajra is the five gnoses.</p>
<p>The eight peaks of Mount Meru above that</p>
<p>Signify the eight liberations.</p>
<p>“Symbolizing the absence of conceptuality about an ordinary universe and inhabitants,</p>
<p>The eight charnel grounds</p>
<p>Should be arranged to the left and right in order.</p>
<p>“The concepts related to each feature, moreover,</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“Symbolizing the power of the antidote fully developed,</p>
<p>Trees are continuously arranged in sequence.</p>
<p>The directional protectors are arranged as symbols</p>
<p>For the overcoming of concepts oriented toward the ten nonvirtues.</p>
<p>“The eight nāgas are stationed</p>
<p>To destroy the wicked ones</p>
<p>Of attachment, hatred, and ignorance.</p>
<p>“Rain clouds are arrayed</p>
<p>So that body and speech may act for the welfare of beings,</p>
<p>With divine pride in the two form buddha bodies</p>
<p>Endowed with great compassion.</p>
<p>“Inner and secret are the same.</p>
<p>Likewise, as for the ultimate, the fourth,</p>
<p>One should learn the oral tradition.</p>
<p>“Then, inside, the celestial palace appears.</p>
<p>Bhruṁ creates an eight-spoked wheel.</p>
<p>The eight spokes stand for the eight consciousnesses.</p>
<p>“The wheel transforms into the body of Vairocana.</p>
<p>Viewed from the outside, he is luminous inside.</p>
<p>Likewise, from inside out,</p>
<p>Meaning that all appears as one.</p>
<p>“The five kinds of gems symbolize the five buddha bodies.</p>
<p>The five colors indicate the five families.</p>
<p>The four corners are said to be the four pure abodes.</p>
<p>“The four sides are the four means of magnetizing.</p>
<p>The four gates are the four foundations of mindfulness.</p>
<p>The eight pillars are the eight liberations.</p>
<p>The four beams symbolize the four gnoses.</p>
<p>All the gate adornments, and so forth,</p>
<p>Are said to be the powers and the like.</p>
<p>“Then, as for the seats inside the palace,</p>
<p>They are lotuses born from vowels as seed-syllables.</p>
<p>The lotus seat indicates not being stained</p>
<p>By the afflictions such as passion, and so forth.</p>
<p>“The sun and moon atop the lotuses</p>
<p>Symbolize skillful means and wisdom.</p>
<p>The corpse is taught first</p>
<p>For the destruction of the self, or conceptuality.</p>
<p>“The four-featured seat of the central deity</p>
<p>Is given as a seat to each member of the retinue,</p>
<p>Since they each are an aspect of the central deity.</p>
<p>“That completes the supportive maṇḍala</p>
<p>Conjoined with its intended meaning.</p>
<p>“Next, the deities are generated</p>
<p>According to the four types of birth.</p>
<p>“The miraculous manner is to arise instantaneously,</p>
<p>Like a fish jumping out of water.</p>
<p>“Birth from heat and moisture is to arise from conditions,</p>
<p>Like a lotus nurtured by the sun.</p>
<p>“Birth from an egg happens through projection and absorption,</p>
<p>Like copper produced from stone.</p>
<p>“Birth from a womb occurs from union,</p>
<p>Burned from above and formed from below,</p>
<p>Like a statue created from wax.</p>
<p>“Vairocana is completed with the palace.</p>
<p>Later, the Heruka is generated.</p>
<p>Conferring initiation is the Blessed One Akṣobhya.</p>
<p>Praise is Ratnasambhava.</p>
<p>“Offering is Amoghasiddhi.</p>
<p>Tasting ambrosia is Amitābha.</p>
<p>The accomplishments that emerge</p>
<p>From these six aspects are extraordinary.</p>
<p>“Then, concerning the recitation, or meditation,</p>
<p>There are those of superior, mediocre, and inferior faculties.</p>
<p>It is said that superior ones</p>
<p>Are to meditate, or recite in full.</p>
<p>“The mediocre should focus on the central deity in father-mother union.</p>
<p>The inferior are to apply themselves to the eyes of the central figure.</p>
<p>Having reached stability on the eyes of the central figure,</p>
<p>They are to meditate on the thirty-seven features in full.</p>
<p>The mediocre are to do likewise.</p>
<p>“Located in the body are channels; circulating within them are winds;</p>
<p>Mounted on these is the mind—the inferior practice involves shape;</p>
<p>The more profound involve mantra and seminal drops;</p>
<p>And the ultimate involves dharma and the seven parts.</p>
<p>Teaching this way is exceedingly profound.</p>
<p>“Everything taught above</p>
<p>Should also be understood as fourfold.</p>
<p>Each one, moreover, is fourfold;</p>
<p>The manifold manner is exceedingly profound.</p>
<p>“Outer and inner is the meaning of mantra.</p>
<p>The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning.</p>
<p>Regarding the outer is the inner.</p>
<p>The secrecy of just that is the secret meaning.</p>
<p>Proficiency is the meaning of perfection.</p>
<p>“The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning.</p>
<p>Inwardly, concerning the characteristics of the maṇḍala,</p>
<p>The aggregates, elements, and sense media</p>
<p>Are each transformed into a deity, either five, six, or thirty-seven;</p>
<p>Left, right, above, below, the gates, and so forth—</p>
<p>These should be understood from a master’s oral instructions.”</p>
<p>Then Vajragarbha asked:</p>
<p>“What is the completion</p>
<p>Of the ‘thirty-seven’?</p>
<p>How are they ‘developed’?</p>
<p>What are their stages?</p>
<p>What is the supportive maṇḍala like?</p>
<p>And how are the sessions and breaks?</p>
<p>How are view and conduct united?</p>
<p>Tell me, O Spiritual Hero!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One said:</p>
<p>“The thirty-seven, the pristine cause,</p>
<p>Give rise to nondual gnosis, the effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cause, which precedes the effect,</p>
<p>Is to become the principal deity.</p>
<p>“Even in just becoming the Heruka</p>
<p>All causes are complete;</p>
<p>The twenty-four locations and so forth</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“The effect does not come from a mistaken cause—</p>
<p>Barley does not sprout from a grain of wheat.</p>
<p>Nor does it come from an incomplete cause—</p>
<p>There is no sprout from damaged grain—</p>
<p>Nor without a cause,</p>
<p>Like fragrance from a space flower.</p>
<p>The cause is not a cause without conditions,</p>
<p>Like a forest fire without wind.</p>
<p>The beginner thus endowed with these four parts</p>
<p>Will abandon concepts.</p>
<p>“Development is said to be done</p>
<p>By one who adheres to deity practice.</p>
<p>Multiple aspects, external and internal,</p>
<p>Are explained as its stages.</p>
<p>“The particular supportive maṇḍala</p>
<p>Is said to be of three types—</p>
<p>Without courtyard, without canopy, and with canopy—</p>
<p>According to inclination.</p>
<p>“Due to the divisions of the four chakras,</p>
<p>Daily sessions are taught as four.</p>
<p>Breaks should also be understood to be four.</p>
<p>“It is taught that a practitioner who switches</p>
<p>To twenty-two and a half minute hours and meditates in eight sessions</p>
<p>Equalizes sessions and breaks.</p>
<p>“During breaks, practitioners</p>
<p>Of mediocre and inferior faculties</p>
<p>Should project the deities in full</p>
<p>And properly perform offerings, and so forth,</p>
<p>Like one candle igniting another.</p>
<p>“View refers to equipoise;</p>
<p>Subsequent attainment is explained as conduct.</p>
<p>“When practicing the development stage,</p>
<p>One is permitted to observe the conduct of wearing the six adornments.</p>
<p>In connection with the secret initiation,</p>
<p>One is allowed to observe the conduct of adornments and ambrosia.</p>
<p>I have said that those of the vajra family, the ratna family,</p>
<p>The padma family, and the karma family are permitted to observe the conduct.</p>
<p>“Those connected with the wisdom-gnosis initiation</p>
<p>Have in common what was taught above, and</p>
<p>In particular, are permitted to observe the conduct of the seal.</p>
<p>“With either conduct devoid of view,</p>
<p>Or view devoid of conduct,</p>
<p>One transgresses the pledges of secret mantra</p>
<p>And takes birth as a hell-being in Endless Torment.</p>
<p>“Therefore, conduct devoid of view should be abandoned;</p>
<p>It is the conduct of a hostile demon.</p>
<p>Likewise, view devoid of conduct is also to be abandoned;</p>
<p>Tormenting the body through austerities</p>
<p>And despising the aggregates that are Vairocana and so forth</p>
<p>Is simply the work of a dry intellectual.</p>
<p>“Consequently, view and conduct are to be unified—</p>
<p>When an elephant rises, it rises all together,</p>
<p>And when an elephant sits, it sits all together.”</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked:</p>
<p>“What is meant by ‘ambrosia’?</p>
<p>What conduct is associated with it?</p>
<p>How do its qualities emerge?</p>
<p>Tell me, O Central Deity,</p>
<p>All the meanings of the adornments and the rest!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“Ambrosia is taught as threefold.</p>
<p>Firstly, one enjoys the outer ambrosia.</p>
<p>Arrange the five hooks</p>
<p>In the five ambrosias and the five meats.</p>
<p>This should begin on the eighth and fourteenth days of the month.</p>
<p>“One should then gather silha wood, Akṣobhya, and dry manure.</p>
<p>This should begin on the twelfth and sixteenth days of the month.</p>
<p>“One should then take Heruka, Vairocana, and essence of dry manure.</p>
<p>The eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days</p>
<p>Of the waxing and waning lunar periods</p>
<p>Are taught as auspicious times for everything.</p>
<p>“The appearance of the lion should be white and excellent,</p>
<p>Its body and speech gentle and without any fault—</p>
<p>This is the basis for the formation of flesh.</p>
<p>As for ox, or elephant,</p>
<p>This should be the flesh of one from which musk and the like emerges</p>
<p>Based on the single material cause of it eating a ketaka flower.</p>
<p>Beef should be flesh that contains bile.</p>
<p>Horse meat should come from the king among horses,</p>
<p>Whose complexion is neither white nor red,</p>
<p>With flesh that neither changes shape nor color.</p>
<p>Human meat must be the flesh of a seventh-birth.</p>
<p>An adept should investigate his body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>The food container should be a skull-cup in a single piece.</p>
<p>The ambrosia should be accomplished with the ingredients inside it.</p>
<p>“Superior, mediocre, and inferior signs—</p>
<p>Blazing, wafting, and bubbling—</p>
<p>Are explained as pertaining to the external signs.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the point of signs having arisen is that old age is eradicated.</p>
<p>If sounds have not been heard there will be no accomplishment.</p>
<p>When sounds have issued forth one will become pure.</p>
<p>“Inner ambrosia is self-arisen.</p>
<p>Having interrupted the flow of ambrosia dripping</p>
<p>From the nine orifices of the one with the bell,</p>
<p>It fills the body like sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Then, as the breath enters the avadhūtī</p>
<p>The circulation of the upper sixth is elicited.</p>
<p>“When silha and camphor abide in the center,</p>
<p>The lower sixth circulates.</p>
<p>This is the secret ambrosia,</p>
<p>Which vanquishes gray hair, wrinkles, and death.</p>
<p>“The practice of conduct is twofold:</p>
<p>For superior and beginner persons.</p>
<p>The ambrosia of the outer sixth is bestowed</p>
<p>In order for them to adhere well to the development stage</p>
<p>And abandon fixation to caste.</p>
<p>“Beginners have both outer and inner ambrosias,</p>
<p>Whose potencies are also manifold—</p>
<p>It renders them devoid of gray hair and destroys conceptuality.</p>
<p>It consecrates the four maṇḍalas.</p>
<p>“It is taught that one will seize the sixth,</p>
<p>Which is situated at the center,</p>
<p>Four finger-widths above the upper tip of the relative,</p>
<p>Through gaining familiarity with the fifth.</p>
<p>“Settling the breath at the location of the navel,</p>
<p>The upper sixth is seized.</p>
<p>Its potencies are also manifold.</p>
<p>One will be devoid of craving and feel buoyant.</p>
<p>Just like an eagle,</p>
<p>One will soar in the sky without plummeting.</p>
<p>“It is said that the lower sixth is situated</p>
<p>At the center of the superior and disconnected ones.</p>
<p>It is taught to superior persons</p>
<p>And its potencies are also manifold.</p>
<p>It blocks the orifice of the one with the bell.</p>
<p>It destroys anger, the first of the adornments.</p>
<p>“The stage of subjugating Rudra</p>
<p>In the great charnel ground of Śītavana</p>
<p>Is that conceptuality is destroyed with ambrosia.</p>
<p>The four enlightened activities are in common.</p>
<p>Through the seal, desire is purified.”</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked:</p>
<p>“What is meant by ‘the sixth’?</p>
<p>What is a superior person like?</p>
<p>How is desire purified?</p>
<p>Tell me, O Spiritual Hero!”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“From the four of right, left, above, and below</p>
<p>Emerges space, the fifth.</p>
<p>The fifth’s absence of nature</p>
<p>Is taught to be the sixth.</p>
<p>“Preceded by joy, supreme joy,</p>
<p>Innate joy, and the freedom from joy,</p>
<p>Great bliss, the fifth, emerges.</p>
<p>Great bliss being pure, devoid of nature,</p>
<p>Is the sixth, pertaining to the lower door.</p>
<p>Therefore, even those who aspire for the sixth</p>
<p>Meditate on the complete fifth,</p>
<p>Preceded by the fourth.</p>
<p>“For example, when the power of alchemy</p>
<p>Is applied to a copper object,</p>
<p>The copper itself becomes gold,</p>
<p>And the gold itself comes from just copper.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Buddha does not teach</p>
<p>That the sixth appears from anything but the fifth.</p>
<p>“Throughout a year, month, fortnight,</p>
<p>Day, night, and hour,</p>
<p>The sixth emerges for only a moment.</p>
<p>It is not the purview of beginners.</p>
<p>“In the same way, a drop of ambrosia</p>
<p>Placed in a vessel of water</p>
<p>Is only experienced as water;</p>
<p>The ambrosia is not experienced.</p>
<p>“Still, based on water,</p>
<p>The ambrosia is also caused to be experienced.</p>
<p>Likewise, based on the elaborate fifth,</p>
<p>The simple sixth emerges.</p>
<p>I have taught this in other tantras.</p>
<p>“A person who has traversed the five signs, the eight flavors,</p>
<p>Or the eight levels, and has thus become clairvoyant,</p>
<p>Has fully relinquished the action seal.</p>
<p>“One who engages in the great seal,</p>
<p>Adhering to a gnosis seal,</p>
<p>Is a superior person.</p>
<p>It is explained that he has seized the sixth.</p>
<p>“Desire is cyclic existence;</p>
<p>Its purification is taught to be nirvana.”</p>
<p>The Second Secret</p>
<p>“Next is the second secret.</p>
<p>It is the profound meaning of dependent origination</p>
<p>In connection with the secret initiation.</p>
<p>“First, give rise to the divine pride.</p>
<p>Know that the ḍākinīs are the channels.</p>
<p>Know that the ḍākas are the spirit of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Know the locations of the chakras, the chakras themselves,</p>
<p>And their related practices.</p>
<p>“The distance from the chakra of great bliss</p>
<p>To the confluence of Brahma</p>
<p>Is forty-eight finger-widths.</p>
<p>Each chakra is three finger-widths,</p>
<p>And thus the nature of enlightened body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>“The locations of the initiations and the chakras</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>An adept must determine whether the wind of the anus</p>
<p>Is three or four finger-widths from the fire of the Brahma confluence.</p>
<p>“Three spaces is the secret location.</p>
<p>Likewise, three spaces marks the chakra of awareness.</p>
<p>Four finger-widths is the location of Hayagrīva.</p>
<p>Eight finger-widths is the location of Secret Guardian of Bliss.</p>
<p>“Based on the particularities of the bodily supports</p>
<p>Of male and female practitioners,</p>
<p>Forty-eight finger-widths can be divided.</p>
<p>In this way, at eight finger-widths is located the secret chakra.</p>
<p>The other chakras, located within forty finger-widths,</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“An adept should determine all of them</p>
<p>As being inside or outside of the spinal column.</p>
<p>“There are also two types of chakra.</p>
<p>First are the chakras themselves; second, the channels.</p>
<p>Chakras are also taught as fourfold:</p>
<p>Conditional, secret, natural, and empowered.</p>
<p>There are two conditional, four secret,</p>
<p>Sixteen natural, and two empowered chakras.</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī, twenty-four,</p>
<p>Are hidden in the four chakras.</p>
<p>“If you turn away from the master in a gathering,</p>
<p>Spread his oral instructions or bandy them about,</p>
<p>Receive the concealed stage in order to indulge in desire,</p>
<p>Turn away from, or disparage the hidden points,</p>
<p>Obstruct the secret mantra, or insult other practices,</p>
<p>You will be reborn in the great hell of Endless Torment,</p>
<p>Until the thousand and one buddhas are all gone.</p>
<p>“I have not said to keep concealed</p>
<p>Anything that is concealed in these chakras.</p>
<p>Thus, what in other tantras has been hidden,</p>
<p>In this tantra I explain in detail.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two, divided into left and right parts,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixty-four.</p>
<p>Thirty-two, paired,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixteen.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two, grouped according to cardinal and intermediate directions,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of eight.</p>
<p>The crown chakra is concealed at the crown.</p>
<p>The Secret Guardian of Bliss is concealed at the navel.</p>
<p>“Sixteen, paired,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of eight.</p>
<p>Sixteen, divided into right and left parts,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of thirty-two.</p>
<p>Sixteen, multiplied by four,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixty-four.</p>
<p>“At the throat, in the chakra of enjoyment,</p>
<p>One enjoys the six flavors.</p>
<p>Thus, Rasanā is concealed in the chakra of enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Hayagrīva chakra is concealed at the throat.</p>
<p>“Eight, divided into right and left parts</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixteen.</p>
<p>Eight, with right, left, top, and bottom,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of thirty-two.</p>
<p>“Eight divided into eight parts, with right, left, top, bottom,</p>
<p>And the four intermediate directions,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixty-four.</p>
<p>The fire at the Brahma confluence is concealed in fire.</p>
<p>“In the dharma chakra at the heart, all phenomena are known.</p>
<p>Therefore, awareness is concealed there.</p>
<p>“Sixty-four, paired,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of thirty-two.</p>
<p>Sixty-four, grouped in fours,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of sixteen.</p>
<p>Sixty-four, grouped in eights,</p>
<p>Is concealed in the amount of eight.</p>
<p>“The wind of the anus is concealed within wind.</p>
<p>The secret inner heat is concealed in the inner heat.</p>
<p>On each chakra there are four chakras</p>
<p>That externally clasp in the form of the life-force.</p>
<p>“Even though waters, streams, and rivers</p>
<p>Are caused to flow in numerous ways,</p>
<p>In the ocean they become one flavor.</p>
<p>“Playing at the navel is the enlightened body of great bliss</p>
<p>Endowed with the liberations and emptinesses,</p>
<p>And likewise the major and minor marks.</p>
<p>“At the heart is the dharma body,</p>
<p>Likewise, with the liberations and so forth.</p>
<p>Similarly, the enjoyment body is at the throat and</p>
<p>The emanation body is at the chakra of great bliss.</p>
<p>“The major marks above and emptiness below</p>
<p>Is the first union of great bliss.</p>
<p>The liberations above and the minor marks below</p>
<p>Is the second union of great bliss.</p>
<p>The others should be learned orally.</p>
<p>The pristine ten powers are the ten unions.</p>
<p>“Wind is the essence of Tārā, in that</p>
<p>The nature of breath fills the six channels.</p>
<p>Fire is the nature of Pāṇḍara­vāsinī, in that</p>
<p>The three corner channels are filled with warmth.</p>
<p>“Naturally present</p>
<p>Are eight and five characteristics.</p>
<p>The eight are the first eight vowels.</p>
<p>The five are the first five consonants, or</p>
<p>The five suffix endings, the palace of knowledge.</p>
<p>“To the right and left of the vowel letter of Hayagrīva</p>
<p>Are two a syllables, at the perimeter of which are nine petals.</p>
<p>“At the chakra of the Secret Guardian of Bliss,</p>
<p>In the center of the four neuter letters and two a syllables,</p>
<p>Are the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p>“Next, concerning the characteristics of the channels,</p>
<p>Seventy-two thousand external channels</p>
<p>Are located in the flesh and give rise to fat.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty internal channels</p>
<p>Are located in the fat and give rise to marrow.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two secret channels</p>
<p>Are located in the bones and give rise to camphor.</p>
<p>The three suchness channels</p>
<p>Are located in the secret place and give rise to bliss.</p>
<p>“There are seventy-two thousand houses.</p>
<p>Each house has a hundred thousand further houses.</p>
<p>The types of worms present in those houses</p>
<p>Are seventy-two thousand and their number</p>
<p>Should likewise be understood as multiplied by a hundred thousand.</p>
<p>“It is taught that in the inner and secret channels</p>
<p>The types of worms also correspond in number.</p>
<p>Within the three suchness channels</p>
<p>Are nine worms that give rise to desire.</p>
<p>With the triad of day, night, and twilight,</p>
<p>These should be understood by the adept as nine.</p>
<p>“The camphor located in those channels</p>
<p>Is the ambrosia emergent from union.</p>
<p>Ambrosia and so forth has already been explained.</p>
<p>“Imagine that yaṁ becomes a maṇḍala of wind,</p>
<p>And raṁ becomes a maṇḍala of fire.</p>
<p>On top of this is the syllable a, which becomes a skull cup.</p>
<p>Then paṁ becomes an eight-petaled lotus.</p>
<p>Imagine a moon disk inside of that.</p>
<p>Arrange the fleshes and so forth on it.</p>
<p>Conceived as four finger-widths, or a full thumb-length, above the central deity,</p>
<p>One should visualize the syllables in reverse order,</p>
<p>“Blue, red, and white.</p>
<p>Imagine a hūṁ becoming a vajra.</p>
<p>Above, visualize the syllable maṁ,</p>
<p>Resting on a sun disk.</p>
<p>This is the union of ambrosia.</p>
<p>“The five fleshes transform into the five seats.</p>
<p>The hooks transform into the five ambrosias.</p>
<p>The karmic winds fan the flames,</p>
<p>Which melts the moon, the central deity, and so forth—</p>
<p>This is ordinary ambrosia.</p>
<p>“The three letters and the sun melt—</p>
<p>This is called divine ambrosia.</p>
<p>That which is summoned by light rays</p>
<p>I have taught to be wisdom ambrosia.</p>
<p>“Circumambulating three times enlightened body, speech, and mind</p>
<p>Is the practice of blessing.</p>
<p>Tasting and offering the ambrosia</p>
<p>Is taught to be the practice of offering.</p>
<p>“Then comes the practice of play,</p>
<p>Which should be understood to mean the right and left.</p>
<p>Next, in the practice of melting,</p>
<p>The equalizing wind and the fire of inner heat</p>
<p>Transform the subtle body into the essence of the four wisdoms.</p>
<p>“One part, Akṣobhya and Vairocana,</p>
<p>Is the flesh-eating ḍākinī, equanimity.</p>
<p>One part is concerted activity,</p>
<p>Which the worms, the action ḍākinīs, offer.</p>
<p>One part, wind and bile,</p>
<p>And through bile, phlegm, and so forth,</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“The gnosis ḍākinī—the channels—</p>
<p>Offers discriminating gnosis.</p>
<p>One part, the lack of nature,</p>
<p>With mirror-like gnosis,</p>
<p>The vajra ḍākinī offers.</p>
<p>“Winds are the vajra ḍākinī, and</p>
<p>Channels are the gnosis ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Camphor is the flesh-eating ḍākinī, and</p>
<p>Worms are the action ḍākinī.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, all the particulars of the ḍākinīs</p>
<p>That dwell in the channels and elsewhere</p>
<p>Should be understood in the proper order.</p>
<p>“Enlightened body is the action ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Enlightened speech is the flesh-eating ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Enlightened mind is the gnosis ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Great bliss is the vajra ḍākinī.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the particulars of the ḍākinīs</p>
<p>Should be understood with respect to the central chakra.</p>
<p>“Joy is the action ḍākinī, and</p>
<p>Supreme joy is the flesh-eating ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Natural joy is the gnosis ḍākinī.</p>
<p>Great bliss is the vajra ḍākinī.</p>
<p>“The ḍāka is the moon disk,</p>
<p>And the ḍākinī is the sun.</p>
<p>The caṇḍalī, twenty-four,</p>
<p>Are ascertained as the four chakras that conceal them.</p>
<p>“The great bliss chakra is absorbed within the enjoyment chakra.</p>
<p>The enjoyment chakra is absorbed within the dharma chakra.</p>
<p>As for the sequence of absorption above,</p>
<p>Everything fuses into a seminal drop.</p>
<p>“This is like how a single sun</p>
<p>Shines throughout the ten directions,</p>
<p>Yet its profusion of rays is fused with it.</p>
<p>It is also like the parasol of a universal monarch,</p>
<p>Which is an assembly of wooden machinery.</p>
<p>“Moreover, once absorbed into the dharma chakra at the heart,</p>
<p>In the center of the sun and moon disk, the size of a chickpea,</p>
<p>Is a seminal drop, the size of a mustard seed.</p>
<p>Around this, on the left and right,</p>
<p>Is a mantra garland as fine as a strand of hair.</p>
<p>The vowels and consonants enwrap the drop like a snake.</p>
<p>“All that is the practice of the seminal drop.</p>
<p>Once the mind has become stable in this,</p>
<p>One may meditate on the subtle practice.</p>
<p>“Imagine that the moon dissolves into the letters,</p>
<p>The letters dissolve into the sun,</p>
<p>And then the sun dissolves into the u vowel diacritic.</p>
<p>The u vowel diacritic and the rest then gradually dissolve.</p>
<p>“The five limbs are the five gnoses.</p>
<p>That is the subtle practice.</p>
<p>Then, with one’s mind on the subtle nāda,</p>
<p>One is to meditate in stages.</p>
<p>“Then comes self-aware gnosis,</p>
<p>In which all phenomena, being empty, are of one taste.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the way in which</p>
<p>The dharma chakra and the emanation chakra</p>
<p>Drip and blaze</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“External concepts are exertion.</p>
<p>Internal concepts are the wind of vitality.</p>
<p>At the central channel where both vitality and exertion are constricted,</p>
<p>Above the nose-tip of the relative,</p>
<p>At a distance of four finger-widths, the three channels converge.</p>
<p>“Since this is the location where the breath is constricted,</p>
<p>Initially, one should hold it there.</p>
<p>Then, hold it in the place of emanation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one should understand how to count it.”</p>
<p>The Third Secret</p>
<p>“Next is the third secret.</p>
<p>It is explained as the basic character of joy</p>
<p>In connection with the wisdom-gnosis initiation.</p>
<p>“The anus quivers and the body hairs rise.</p>
<p>Twelve nonobservations of the basic character of joy</p>
<p>Is taught to be its nature.</p>
<p>“With the circulation of the spirit of enlightenment, one reflects on nonconceptuality.</p>
<p>Twenty-five nonobservations of supreme joy</p>
<p>Completely fills the secret gem.</p>
<p>“The nonobservation of innate joy</p>
<p>Is taught to be the dharma body.</p>
<p>The interruption of the flow of bliss is the joy of cessation;</p>
<p>Its nonobservation is the two form buddha bodies.</p>
<p>“Moreover, all the preliminaries,</p>
<p>The subsidiary techniques, and actual union,</p>
<p>Along with their intention, are in stages.</p>
<p>“Despite multiply radiating like a cluster of stars,</p>
<p>They coalesce like the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Despite coalescing like the sun and moon,</p>
<p>They are nondual like an eclipse.”</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked:</p>
<p>“What is a cluster of stars?</p>
<p>What is coalescence?</p>
<p>What is nonduality?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment</p>
<p>Are radiated as the features of the cause.</p>
<p>The three buddha bodies and the five gnoses</p>
<p>Are radiated as the features of the fruition.</p>
<p>“The causes are absorbed within seven,</p>
<p>And the fruitions are absorbed within three.</p>
<p>The causes dissolve into the fruitions, and</p>
<p>The fruition should be meditated upon as twofold.</p>
<p>“All phenomena are the essence of mind.</p>
<p>Mind is of an empty nature.</p>
<p>All is of one taste in being empty.</p>
<p>This is the expanse devoid of accepting and rejecting.</p>
<p>“In order to fully purify desire,</p>
<p>Desire rooted in the five seals of enlightened body—</p>
<p>The pair of the great seal and the gnosis seal,</p>
<p>Along with the samaya seal, the dharma seal, and the action seal—</p>
<p>Becomes exceedingly profound.</p>
<p>“This is great bliss, which is threefold—</p>
<p>The natures of development and completion,</p>
<p>And the chakra of great bliss.</p>
<p>The first abides as the letter e at the secret nose-tip.</p>
<p>“The second, which fills the emanation chakra,</p>
<p>The awareness chakra, and the rest,</p>
<p>Abides in the Secret Guardian of Bliss.</p>
<p>“The natural chakra of great bliss</p>
<p>Is replete with the flavor of great bliss,</p>
<p>Just as a sesame seed is with sesame butter.</p>
<p>“Like sap dripping</p>
<p>From a cut tree branch,</p>
<p>From that great bliss itself comes the</p>
<p>Form of hundreds, thousands,</p>
<p>Tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands of tips of hair.</p>
<p>“First comes a cloudy form;</p>
<p>The second resembles smoke.</p>
<p>Third is the form of lightning;</p>
<p>The fourth resembles a butter lamp.</p>
<p>The sequence of all these, moreover,</p>
<p>Occurs according to the order of the emanation chakra and the rest.</p>
<p>“The emergence of the form of clouds</p>
<p>Is the sign for birth, the syllable a.</p>
<p>That which resembles a butter lamp</p>
<p>Is taught to be the sign of haṁ, for death.</p>
<p>“The fifth, which resembles space,</p>
<p>Should be understood as the empty sign</p>
<p>For the intermediate state, non-duality.</p>
<p>Moreover,  vibrating and so forth</p>
<p>Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions.</p>
<p>“Next, concerning the third secret,</p>
<p>The characteristics of the four joys</p>
<p>In connection with the wisdom-gnosis initiation are as follows:</p>
<p>The anus quivering, body hairs rising,</p>
<p>And the body vibrating are the essence of joy.</p>
<p>“Reflecting on the bliss of the spirit of enlightenment circulating</p>
<p>From the base of the secret vajra</p>
<p>Is the essence of supreme joy.</p>
<p>“Reflecting on vajra and lotus stoppered</p>
<p>Is the essence of innate joy.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the bliss of having the continuity of bliss interrupted</p>
<p>Is the essence of the joy of cessation.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the characteristics of all these,</p>
<p>Such as the factor of the spirit of enlightenment, and so forth,</p>
<p>Should be understood in terms of what was taught above.</p>
<p>“Joy is called luminance;</p>
<p>Supreme joy is radiance.</p>
<p>Extreme joy is imminence.</p>
<p>Innate joy is clear light.</p>
<p>“The natures of the four gnoses</p>
<p>Are the antidotes that destroy the four demons.</p>
<p>The coarse level is secretly destroyed by four.</p>
<p>The four subtle demons are naturally</p>
<p>Destroyed in the four chakras.</p>
<p>“The four joys based on the chakras</p>
<p>Themselves appear as the four gnoses,</p>
<p>And therefore destroy the four demons.</p>
<p>“The three poisons based on desire</p>
<p>Are the demon of afflictions,</p>
<p>Involving twelve attributes of desire.</p>
<p>The Secret Guardian of Bliss destroys the afflictions.</p>
<p>“Color and shape are the demon of the aggregates.</p>
<p>The Hayagrīva chakra destroys the aggregates.</p>
<p>The four concealed things are the demon of the gods.</p>
<p>The chakra of awareness destroys the demon of the gods.</p>
<p>“As for death, along with birth,</p>
<p>The secret of their nonorigination destroys the lord of death.</p>
<p>The destruction of the subtle demons is similar.</p>
<p>“Concerning the four moments and the four sections;</p>
<p>The four auspiciousnesses and the four truths;</p>
<p>The four elements and the four mothers;</p>
<p>The four pure stations, and so forth—</p>
<p>Apart from the four gnoses themselves</p>
<p>There is nothing higher to be found.</p>
<p>“It is due to the particularities of concepts</p>
<p>And, furthermore, the particularities of inclinations</p>
<p>And the particularities of various religious systems</p>
<p>That such a plethora has been taught.</p>
<p>“A practitioner who has traversed the three initiations</p>
<p>Is taught to be a great, fully ordained monk.</p>
<p>For it is taught that he will accomplish all.”</p>
<p>Vajragarbha then asked:</p>
<p>“What is such a triple-initiation fully ordained monk like?</p>
<p>What are his activities?”</p>
<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>
<p>“Fully ordained monks, and so forth, are threefold:</p>
<p>Prātimokṣa, bodhisattva,</p>
<p>And knowledge-holder fully ordained monks.</p>
<p>“According to the sequence of possessing</p>
<p>One, four, ten, or two hundred and fifty vows,</p>
<p>Temporary lay-vow holders, permanent lay-vow holders, novice monks,</p>
<p>And fully ordained monks, respectively, are those of prātimokṣa.</p>
<p>“Those of generosity, great generosity,</p>
<p>Extreme generosity, and complete generosity</p>
<p>Are bodhisattva temporary lay-vow holders, permanent lay-vow holders,</p>
<p>Novice monks, and fully ordained monks, respectively.</p>
<p>“Those who adhere to virtue</p>
<p>Upon having entered the maṇḍala</p>
<p>Are adherents of virtue, temporary lay-vow holders.</p>
<p>With seven, they are great.</p>
<p>“Concerning the particular three great ones,</p>
<p>By being in service to the virtue of the vase initiation,</p>
<p>One is in the service of virtue, a permanent lay-vow holder.</p>
<p>Therefore, with seven, they are great.</p>
<p>“One who is in accordance with the virtue of the secret initiation</p>
<p>Is in harmony with virtue, a novice.</p>
<p>With seven, they become great.</p>
<p>“By upholding that very virtue of wisdom-gnosis,</p>
<p>One is an upholder of virtue, a fully ordained monk.</p>
<p>With seven, they are great.</p>
<p>“These particular three great ones</p>
<p>Are also the three non-returners,</p>
<p>In that reverting back to karmic maturation, cyclic existence, and the lower vehicle—</p>
<p>The three abandonments—are renounced by the three vehicles, respectively,</p>
<p>And those of the knowledge-holder vehicle adhere to the fruition.</p>
<p>“A practitioner who adheres to this fruition</p>
<p>Should dwell in the apparel</p>
<p>Of a householder, or a vajra-holder,</p>
<p>And confer initiations, consecrations, and so forth.</p>
<p>“I have not taught that one should perform secret conduct</p>
<p>In the apparel of all three vehicles.</p>
<p>For example, copper is wrought from stone.</p>
<p>Based on copper, one can enjoy the appearance of gold.</p>
<p>When there is copper, there is no stone.</p>
<p>By becoming golden, stone no longer appears.</p>
<p>“The Buddha has not taught that</p>
<p>A knowledge-holder fully ordained monk</p>
<p>Should embody both</p>
<p>Prātimokṣa and bodhisattva vows.”</p>
<p>The Fourth Secret</p>
<p>“Next is the fourth secret,</p>
<p>Related to the fourth initiation.</p>
<p>Here one should meditate, having overcome</p>
<p>This perpetually shifting mind itself,</p>
<p>As well as its attendant objects of meditation—</p>
<p>The forms and so forth that it latches onto.</p>
<p>“Having fully relinquished all reference points</p>
<p>Of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects,</p>
<p>Since the nature of mind is inconceivable,</p>
<p>One should not think of anything whatsoever.</p>
<p>“When the nature of mind is submerged within the empty,</p>
<p>And the empty is well submerged within the mind,</p>
<p>Concepts of empty, not empty, and so forth</p>
<p>Are destroyed, leaving the mind like the sky.</p>
<p>“There does not exist a support, there is nothing supported.</p>
<p>Even the matchless state does not exist.</p>
<p>The perfected presence of precisely that</p>
<p>Is innate nondual awareness.”</p>
<p>The Final Teaching</p>
<p>Next, the Blessed One spoke on resolving:</p>
<p>“Having meditated authentically on the great seal,</p>
<p>Without understanding that the wrathful dances</p>
<p>And the seals are merely an illusory display,</p>
<p>One will be born as a haughty spirit—</p>
<p>One of the kings of the eight charnel grounds—</p>
<p>Devoid of compassion, an eater of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>“If one enters the outer, inner, concealed,</p>
<p>And ultimate maṇḍalas and obtains initiation,</p>
<p>One must meditate, recite, and so forth,</p>
<p>Lest one might obstruct and denigrate the secret mantra.</p>
<p>“Disparaging any spiritual practice,</p>
<p>Ridiculing vajra siblings, disciples with shared tantric commitments,</p>
<p>Breaking the root and branch samaya vows,</p>
<p>Cursing the lama—by the fruition of these</p>
<p>One will be born as a hell-being in Endless Torment.</p>
<p>“I have explained that not to understand</p>
<p>The significance of the channel-chakras</p>
<p>Of profound interdependent origination</p>
<p>Is to straddle a blade sixteen finger-widths long.</p>
<p>“If one does not understand the hidden secret,</p>
<p>Through the threefold nonobservation of the concealed</p>
<p>One will be born below as a hell being.</p>
<p>As the wheel of a cart revolves,</p>
<p>So will one revolve due to the maturation of karma.</p>
<p>“Through knowing it, the very meaning of the view—one’s own self-awareness‌;</p>
<p>Self-awareness‌, whatever bliss is desired;</p>
<p>Self-awareness‌, whatever illusory display is desired;</p>
<p>Self-awareness‌, like a crystal orb;</p>
<p>Basic space and gnosis, and so forth—</p>
<p>Is thus resolved.</p>
<p>“The meaning of tantra is threefold.</p>
<p>The chakra of great bliss is the causal tantra;</p>
<p>The secret nose-tip is the means tantra;</p>
<p>The Secret Guardian of Bliss is the fruitional tantra.</p>
<p>“The vase is taught to be the causal tantra;</p>
<p>The secret is the means tantra;</p>
<p>The wisdom-gnosis is the fruitional tantra.</p>
<p>“Birth is taught to be the causal tantra.</p>
<p>Death is taught to be the means tantra.</p>
<p>The intermediate state is the fruitional tantra.</p>
<p>“ ‘Tantra’ means continuum;</p>
<p>Its king, which teaches secrets,</p>
<p>Has taught secrets as fourfold.</p>
<p>“The vase initiation is secret for beginners.</p>
<p>At the time of the vase initiation, the secret initiation is secret.</p>
<p>Wisdom-gnosis is secret in the secret initiation.</p>
<p>Self-awareness‌ is secret in the wisdom-gnosis initiation.</p>
<p>The secret chakra is the fourth secret.”</p>
<p>Then, the bodhisattva Vajragarbha and an assembly of ḍākinīs equal in number to the atoms in Mount Meru circumambulated the Blessed One three times and disappeared.</p>
<p>This concludes “The Glorious King of Tantras That Resolves All Secrets.”</p>
